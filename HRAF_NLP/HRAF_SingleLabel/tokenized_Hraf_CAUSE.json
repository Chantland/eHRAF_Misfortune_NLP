Such persons may also be called upon to injure another, as to induce insanity, blindness, lameness, discoloration of the face, distortion of the mouth, etc. On the other hand, there are owners of Cree medicine who have the power to remove or restore all injuries produced in this way.

It is said that the medicine will reach him although a thousand miles away. An informant well versed in the Cree medicine states that he knew of its being used on a woman noted for her extra fine beadwork. In consequence of her skill in this line one of her neighbors became very jealous of her and so made medicine causing her skillful rival to suffer many months with a sore hand. After she had been unable to use her hand for a year a white doctor lanced it and found part of a needle in the palm. When the people heard of this they told the doctor that the needle had been shot into the woman\u2019s hand by means of Cree medicine but he only laughed and said there was no such thing. So to prove that story, they told him to see how long he could keep this needle. Then he put it into a bottle and corked it up tightly but was greatly surprised the next day when he found that the bottle was still corked up but no needle inside. A year after this he cut another needle from the same woman\u2019s hand. Later, it disappeared and turned up in one of her knees on account of which her leg has always been stiff.

There are less than twenty horse medicinemen. Another way in which the horse medicinemen may exert their power is when running buffalo in the winter when the ground is icy and they use their power to prevent their horses from slipping on the ice. There is still another way to show their power. When a man wishes to go to war to steal horses he goes to one of the horse medicinemen with a pipe filled with tobacco and asks for help. The horse medicineman paints him and gives him a small buckskin bag containing powdered medicine, tells him how it is to be used, and what songs to sing. The man desiring the power does not paint until the war party is within sight of the enemy\u2019s camp. Then he paints his face as he was told, rubs his whole body and his rope with the medicine and ties it to his necklace. He then sings the songs of the horse medicine and tells what kind of horses he wishes. After one has been rubbed with the medicine any horse can be taken. If the rope is rubbed with the medicine he can never miss when throwing it. After a man is painted he must keep to one side of the warriors as they go towards the camp. He must not let anyone cross his tracks. If this does happen, the person doing it would at once become crippled in some manner.

The penalties for disregarding these injunctions are usually some kind of illness. Sore mouth, sore eyes, blindness, boils, etc., are generally regarded as resulting from such, and for anyone to be so afflicted is of itself evidence of such violations. Curiously enough, the violation, if such it be, cannot always be laid to the victim himself, since by social usage he may be forced to keep his seat while another is doing the very thing his medicine prohibits. For example, if metal must not be struck in the presence of a certain paintedtipi owner, it is not likely that he himself will violate the injunction, but he may be unable to prevent others from doing the striking.

He said: \u201cWolves and coyotes are very wise, their wisdom having been given to them by Napi (Old Man). Although savage by nature, they sometimes use their wisdom to help people when in danger and distress. I recall a strange incident that happened many years ago, when we were camped far out on the plains. It was a cold winter. There had been a big storm and the snow lay deep. Menepoka, an old man, went alone and on foot from camp to look for horses. He carried a quirt and was dragging a long rawhide lariat. He felt something tugging, and turning about, saw a large coyote biting at the other end of his lariat. He stopped and yelled at the coyote, calling him evil names to scare him away. The coyote trotted to the summit of a butte near by, and howled four times to the north, south, east and west. Before long another coyote appeared. Then another came running up to him, and they kept on coming, until Menepoka found himself surrounded by them. The terrible circle, with hideous cries, red mouths and glittering eyes, drew closer and closer. He tried to drive them away with his quirt, but without effect. He expected that, in a moment, they would rush upon him and tear him to pieces. He was old and not strong, and in his terror his legs gave way and he sank down into the snow. It happened that an Indian on horseback had ridden to the summit of a neighbouring butte looking for his horses. Hearing the coyote pack making an unusual outcry, he rode towards them, thinking they had made a kill of game they had run down in the snow. Discovering a human body lying on the ground, he gave a shrill cry and galloped towards them, shooting an arrow into their midst. The coyotes quickly scattered, and he then saw that it was Menepoka lying in the snow as if dead. Lifting him upon his horse he took him back to camp. Our medicine man tried to drive out the evil spirit, going through with the motions of pulling something from his body, explaining that, when the coyotes were closing in upon Menepoka, they were constantly shooting their hairs into him. But the incantations were of no avail, because the evil spirit was one over which the medicine man had no power. Menepoka lived for only a few days. When he died, his body was placed upon the summit of the high butte, where the famous chief Big Nose now lies.

It being their universal belief that illness of the body signified possession by an evil spirit, their methods of healing, in common with those of all savage tribes, naturally took the form of incantation and occult ceremonies for exorcising it. No doubt the title of \u201cmedicine,\u201d by which their doctors were known in our early chronicles of the Indians, had its origin in this manner with the early French colonists. By a natural transition it passed into that of \u201cmedicine men,\u201d with English speaking people. A \u201cmedicine man\u201d is believed to control the weather, to heal the sick and exorcise evil spirits by means of incantations and magic arts. He is really more of a magician than a medical doctor, although he constantly assumes the functions of the latter. His vocation is to instruct and guide in the avoidance of acts that are \u201cbad medicine\u201d and therefore unlucky, and in the use of the best means for propitiating the Evil Power, because of unlucky acts already committed. When an Indian is \u201cmaking medicine,\u201d he is performing mysterious ceremonies, or using other approved means for controlling the supernatural powers and averting the malevolence of the evil spirits. Some authorities have understood the word as meaning \u201cmystery,\u201d and the medicine man as \u201cmystery man.\u201d But this is not an adequate expression. While there is no corresponding word in the English language to express the equivalent of the Indian idea, the phrase \u201csupernatural power\u201d is probably the nearest equivalent to the word \u201cmedicine,\u201d in its common Indian use.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2009, 2003, 5263, 2005, 1996, 3017, 3837, 2000, 3305, 1010, 2030, 10197, 1996, 3928, 3747, 1010, 2029, 1996, 1523, 4200, 1524, 9029, 2031, 2005, 5535, 4654, 28728, 2588, 1996, 2796, 2839, 1998, 8807, 2166, 1012, 2009, 2108, 2037, 5415, 6772, 2008, 7355, 1997, 1996, 2303, 3696, 7810, 6664, 2011, 2019, 4763, 4382, 1010, 2037, 4725, 1997, 8907, 1010, 1999, 2691, 2007, 2216, 1997, 2035, 9576, 6946, 1010, 8100, 2165, 1996, 2433, 1997, 27523, 23436, 1998, 27906, 10912, 2005, 4654, 2953, 22987, 2075, 2009, 1012, 2053, 4797, 1996, 2516, 1997, 1523, 4200, 1010, 1524, 2011, 2029, 2037, 7435, 2020, 2124, 1999, 2256, 2220, 11906, 1997, 1996, 6505, 1010, 2018, 2049, 4761, 1999, 2023, 5450, 2007, 1996, 2220, 2413, 15526, 1012, 2011, 1037, 3019, 6653, 2009, 2979, 2046, 2008, 1997, 1523, 4200, 2273, 1010, 1524, 2007, 2394, 4092, 2111, 1012, 1037, 1523, 4200, 2158, 1524, 2003, 3373, 2000, 2491, 1996, 4633, 1010, 2000, 11005, 1996, 5305, 1998, 4654, 2953, 18380, 4763, 8633, 2011, 2965, 1997, 27523, 23436, 2015, 1998, 3894, 2840, 1012, 2002, 2003, 2428, 2062, 1997, 1037, 16669, 2084, 1037, 2966, 3460, 1010, 2348, 2002, 7887, 15980, 1996, 4972, 1997, 1996, 3732, 1012, 2010, 29536, 10719, 2003, 2000, 16021, 18300, 1998, 5009, 1999, 1996, 24685, 1997, 4490, 2008, 2024, 1523, 2919, 4200, 1524, 1998, 3568, 4895, 7630, 17413, 1010, 1998, 1999, 1996, 2224, 1997, 1996, 2190, 2965, 2005, 17678, 29050, 3436, 1996, 4763, 2373, 1010, 2138, 1997, 4895, 7630, 17413, 4490, 2525, 5462, 1012, 2043, 2019, 2796, 2003, 1523, 2437, 4200, 1010, 1524, 2002, 2003, 4488, 8075, 10912, 1010, 2030, 2478, 2060, 4844, 2965, 2005, 9756, 1996, 11189, 4204, 1998, 13642, 24097, 1996, 3287, 6767, 22717, 1997, 1996, 4763, 8633, 1012, 2070, 4614, 2031, 5319, 1996, 2773, 2004, 3574, 1523, 6547, 1010, 1524, 1998, 1996, 4200, 2158, 2004, 1523, 6547, 2158, 1012, 1524, 2021, 2023, 2003, 2025, 2019, 11706, 3670, 1012, 2096, 2045, 2003, 2053, 7978, 2773, 1999, 1996, 2394, 2653, 2000, 4671, 1996, 5662, 1997, 1996, 2796, 2801, 1010, 1996, 7655, 1523, 11189, 2373, 1524, 2003, 2763, 1996, 7205, 5662, 2000, 1996, 2773, 1523, 4200, 1010, 1524, 1999, 2049, 2691, 2796, 2224, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9591586589813232, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "The Blackfeet had a Love medicine, which they called Ito-wa-mami-wa-natsi (Cree medicine), because it was generally obtained from the Crees, who were specialists in its manufacture. In talking with E-kum-makon about the Cree medicine, he said that he had used it to regain the affection of his young wife. When she left him and returned to her father\u2019s lodge, he made a long journey north, to visit a Cree medicine man, from whom he purchased some of the Love medicine. It consisted of a small beaded buckskin bag containing a sweet-smelling powder. As the Cree magician had directed, he secured one of his wife\u2019s hairs and, winding it with one of his own, placed them together in the medicine bag. He carried it with him everywhere, fastened around his neck by a buckskin string and wore it beneath his shirt. He firmly believed in its power, because his wife had returned and became so much attached to him, that she was unwilling to leave his side and they went everywhere together. Soon after this E-kum-makon had a severe illness, lasting so long he thought he must be bewitched by Little Plume, who owned a Porcupine-Quill medicine. It consisted of a small stone, or wooden image of a person, a porcupine quill and some red paint, by which the owner was able to cast an evil spell over people. If he placed the red paint between the eyes of the image, the one whom he desired to injure became ill; if over the lungs, he had a hemorrhage; if on the top of the head, he became crazy; if over the heart, it caused death. E-kum-makon became so worried over his health, that he again sought the advice of the Cree medicine man, who informed him that his sickness was caused by the improper use of the Love medicine. It should not have been carried around with him, but left inside his tipi, tied to one of the lodge poles, where it properly belonged. The medicine man also explained, that it was wrong to put the hairs into the bag without the burning of incense, which was necessary to ward off the Evil Power.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 2304, 7959, 3388, 2018, 1037, 2293, 4200, 1010, 2029, 2027, 2170, 23333, 1011, 11333, 1011, 5003, 4328, 1011, 11333, 1011, 14085, 5332, 1006, 27831, 4200, 1007, 1010, 2138, 2009, 2001, 3227, 4663, 2013, 1996, 27831, 2015, 1010, 2040, 2020, 15744, 1999, 2049, 9922, 1012, 1999, 3331, 2007, 1041, 1011, 13970, 2213, 1011, 5003, 19648, 2055, 1996, 27831, 4200, 1010, 2002, 2056, 2008, 2002, 2018, 2109, 2009, 2000, 12452, 1996, 12242, 1997, 2010, 2402, 2564, 1012, 2043, 2016, 2187, 2032, 1998, 2513, 2000, 2014, 2269, 1521, 1055, 7410, 1010, 2002, 2081, 1037, 2146, 4990, 2167, 1010, 2000, 3942, 1037, 27831, 4200, 2158, 1010, 2013, 3183, 2002, 4156, 2070, 1997, 1996, 2293, 4200, 1012, 2009, 5031, 1997, 1037, 2235, 26892, 5732, 14189, 4939, 4524, 4820, 1037, 4086, 1011, 19773, 9898, 1012, 2004, 1996, 27831, 16669, 2018, 2856, 1010, 2002, 7119, 2028, 1997, 2010, 2564, 1521, 1055, 13606, 1998, 1010, 12788, 2009, 2007, 2028, 1997, 2010, 2219, 1010, 2872, 2068, 2362, 1999, 1996, 4200, 4524, 1012, 2002, 3344, 2009, 2007, 2032, 7249, 1010, 24009, 2105, 2010, 3300, 2011, 1037, 14189, 4939, 5164, 1998, 5078, 2009, 4218, 2010, 3797, 1012, 2002, 7933, 3373, 1999, 2049, 2373, 1010, 2138, 2010, 2564, 2018, 2513, 1998, 2150, 2061, 2172, 4987, 2000, 2032, 1010, 2008, 2016, 2001, 15175, 2000, 2681, 2010, 2217, 1998, 2027, 2253, 7249, 2362, 1012, 2574, 2044, 2023, 1041, 1011, 13970, 2213, 1011, 5003, 19648, 2018, 1037, 5729, 7355, 1010, 9879, 2061, 2146, 2002, 2245, 2002, 2442, 2022, 2022, 9148, 28265, 2011, 2210, 26888, 1010, 2040, 3079, 1037, 18499, 15569, 3170, 1011, 21864, 3363, 4200, 1012, 2009, 5031, 1997, 1037, 2235, 2962, 1010, 2030, 4799, 3746, 1997, 1037, 2711, 1010, 1037, 18499, 15569, 3170, 21864, 3363, 1998, 2070, 2417, 6773, 1010, 2011, 2029, 1996, 3954, 2001, 2583, 2000, 3459, 2019, 4763, 6297, 2058, 2111, 1012, 2065, 2002, 2872, 1996, 2417, 6773, 2090, 1996, 2159, 1997, 1996, 3746, 1010, 1996, 2028, 3183, 2002, 9059, 2000, 1999, 25243, 2150, 5665, 1025, 2065, 2058, 1996, 8948, 1010, 2002, 2018, 1037, 19610, 2953, 25032, 4270, 1025, 2065, 2006, 1996, 2327, 1997, 1996, 2132, 1010, 2002, 2150, 4689, 1025, 2065, 2058, 1996, 2540, 1010, 2009, 3303, 2331, 1012, 1041, 1011, 13970, 2213, 1011, 5003, 19648, 2150, 2061, 5191, 2058, 2010, 2740, 1010, 2008, 2002, 2153, 4912, 1996, 6040, 1997, 1996, 27831, 4200, 2158, 1010, 2040, 6727, 2032, 2008, 2010, 15556, 2001, 3303, 2011, 1996, 24156, 2224, 1997, 1996, 2293, 4200, 1012, 2009, 2323, 2025, 2031, 2042, 3344, 2105, 2007, 2032, 1010, 2021, 2187, 2503, 2010, 5955, 2072, 1010, 5079, 2000, 2028, 1997, 1996, 7410, 10567, 1010, 2073, 2009, 7919, 6272, 1012, 1996, 4200, 2158, 2036, 4541, 1010, 2008, 2009, 2001, 3308, 2000, 2404, 1996, 13606, 2046, 1996, 4524, 2302, 1996, 5255, 1997, 28647, 1010, 2029, 2001, 4072, 2000, 4829, 2125, 1996, 4763, 2373, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9553921818733215, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "No Blackfoot would venture to copy the design of a painted tipi, unless it had been regularly transferred to him, or been received in a dream, believing that such an infringement would incur the penalty of sickness, or death.

In 1889, the Blackfoot population stood at 815; in 1896, it reached 1,226; but since the death rate was nearly double the birth rate, the future did not look auspicious.

He knew that it came from the seven stars. The Crow gave him some seeds of a small plant with a song, which gave him a membership. After a time he dreamed of six dwarfs and they gave him power to get horses, property, food, and long life. Since that time he has always had abundance. When he came back to the Piegan, he sold or transferred to Curly-bear some of his power and since that time the latter has prospered. He claims that all of the members are prosperous. When a member is taken in he is given the skin of an otter, blackbird, weasel, beaver, or something with a song. These songs must have been dreamed by some of the members. Women can be taken in alone, but if married, both husband and wife must join; likewise when a man joins, his wife must enter. A man joins by calling upon a member, making him gifts and asking him for some of the Crow-water power. These gifts are supposed to be many quilts, horses, etc. Each member gives him some object and an associated song. The members receiving the gifts must divide them among other members as far as they will go, one thing for each. Each one receiving a horse must contribute some object, a song and some power, the others are free to choose. Thus, the highest price paid for membership brings the most medicines. The objects are placed in a bundle which becomes the new member\u2019s individual medicine. They are not treated as most medicine bundles, but may be opened at any time. In the ceremonies the women usually do the dancing. The men seldom dance out do the singing. The women do not sing when they are dancing. There are no regular times for meetings, but it is usual to hold them every Sunday and at the time of the new moon. Ceremonies are held in compliance with vows of outsiders or members as with other medicines, but they may meet on any occasion. The number of members is not limited in any way. None of the proceedings are secret. Everybody may look in, but only members can come inside of the tipi or ceremonial circle. The members usually paint their faces yellow, with red bars across the mouth and forehead. A rectangle of red is also made upon the backs of the hands. A few plumes and feathers are worn on the head. There are no other regalia, the chief things being the individual bundles of the members. The taboos observed by bundle owners are also in evidence. Neither marrow nor bones may be placed in the fire or the owner\u2019s horse will have his leg broken. Lodge pins must not be put in the fire or the owner will have a tumor (?); nor must iron be put in the fire and allowed to become red hot, or the owner\u2019s teeth will fall out. If lodge poles are burnt up, horses will die. The owner must not touch moccasins while smoking; he will have a seabby mouth. Moccasins placed under the bed will bring bad luck. When dancing and smoking, if one should pass in front of him, the smoker goes blind. He must not lend a blanket to another as this will bring bad results. The medicine formula or power may be used as follows:\u2014If a member wishes a horse, he calls in other members and sings the songs and offers prayers.

Naturally, many points mentioned under previous heads may be considered as bearing upon this topic. On approaching the tipi of a stranger, it is proper for a man to pause some distance away and call out to know if the head of the family is at home. If he is out and there is no adult male to act instead, the visitor is upon such information not expected to enter but may, of course, carry on a conversation with the women on the outside. When one is acquainted, or where the man is known to be within, he enters without ceremony and takes a place to his right of the door. Should the entire side be unoccupied he moves up to a place opposite the host; should it be occupied he takes the first vacant place. However, a man\u2019s status and age may make it incumbent upon those seated to make a place appropriate to his rank. 1 1 The ownership of certain medicines may determine the seat. Thus, as guests, the medicine pipe men are given a seat opposite the host and must give way to no one. Should they go out for an interval, no one should occupy the seat. As the penalty will be disease, we have here what may be considered a taboo. The fire is the dividing point of the house: hence, to pass between a guest and the fire is very impolite.

The mutilation of the body by offerings of a finger or bits of flesh from the arms and legs were considered lesser ordeals (Wissler, pp. 263\u2013265). Scraping White showed the writer soars on his legs resulting from the sacrifice of pieces of flesh to the sun prior to the year of his torture experience. Nevertheless, the belief of the Piegan that men who submitted to the torture would not live long after they had given their bodies to the sun, appears to have been based upon religious fear rather than the life histories of men who had been tortured. Several of our elderly South Piegan informants recalled having seen older men of the tribe who bore the scars of the torture. The severity of the torture varied with the depth of the incisions. Older men watched the suppliant carefully, and did not permit the torture to be prolonged indefinitely. Even in the case of Heavy Head, whose experience was described by other elderly Blood Indians as the most severe punishment they had witnessed in sun dance tortures, the performance lasted only a few minutes. His narrative indicates the pain and nervous shock must have been intense. But in the majority of cases it probably did no permanent damage to the individual. Although Scraping White and Heavy Head still bear the scare of their torture, these men appear to be in fair health, active of mind and body, nearly six decades after they expiated their vows to the sun in the Blood medicine lodge in the summer of 1889.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 2304, 13064, 6946, 5240, 1996, 8639, 1010, 2107, 2004, 2001, 16753, 2011, 23704, 2317, 1998, 3082, 2132, 1010, 2004, 1996, 2087, 4795, 1998, 5729, 2433, 1997, 3558, 8688, 2000, 1996, 3103, 1012, 1996, 14163, 26065, 3508, 1997, 1996, 2303, 2011, 14927, 1997, 1037, 4344, 2030, 9017, 1997, 5771, 2013, 1996, 2608, 1998, 3456, 2020, 2641, 8276, 23304, 2015, 1006, 15536, 23385, 1010, 4903, 1012, 25246, 1516, 20549, 1007, 1012, 23704, 2317, 3662, 1996, 3213, 2061, 11650, 2006, 2010, 3456, 4525, 2013, 1996, 8688, 1997, 4109, 1997, 5771, 2000, 1996, 3103, 3188, 2000, 1996, 2095, 1997, 2010, 8639, 3325, 1012, 6600, 1010, 1996, 6772, 1997, 1996, 11345, 5289, 2008, 2273, 2040, 7864, 2000, 1996, 8639, 2052, 2025, 2444, 2146, 2044, 2027, 2018, 2445, 2037, 4230, 2000, 1996, 3103, 1010, 3544, 2000, 2031, 2042, 2241, 2588, 3412, 3571, 2738, 2084, 1996, 2166, 15215, 1997, 2273, 2040, 2018, 2042, 12364, 1012, 2195, 1997, 2256, 9750, 2148, 11345, 5289, 28694, 2015, 7383, 2383, 2464, 3080, 2273, 1997, 1996, 5917, 2040, 8501, 1996, 13521, 1997, 1996, 8639, 1012, 1996, 18976, 1997, 1996, 8639, 9426, 2007, 1996, 5995, 1997, 1996, 4297, 19969, 2015, 1012, 3080, 2273, 3427, 1996, 10514, 9397, 15204, 2102, 5362, 1010, 1998, 2106, 2025, 9146, 1996, 8639, 2000, 2022, 15330, 20733, 1012, 2130, 1999, 1996, 2553, 1997, 3082, 2132, 1010, 3005, 3325, 2001, 2649, 2011, 2060, 9750, 2668, 6505, 2004, 1996, 2087, 5729, 7750, 2027, 2018, 9741, 1999, 3103, 3153, 8639, 2015, 1010, 1996, 2836, 6354, 2069, 1037, 2261, 2781, 1012, 2010, 7984, 7127, 1996, 3255, 1998, 6091, 5213, 2442, 2031, 2042, 6387, 1012, 2021, 1999, 1996, 3484, 1997, 3572, 2009, 2763, 2106, 2053, 4568, 4053, 2000, 1996, 3265, 1012, 2348, 23704, 2317, 1998, 3082, 2132, 2145, 4562, 1996, 12665, 1997, 2037, 8639, 1010, 2122, 2273, 3711, 2000, 2022, 1999, 4189, 2740, 1010, 3161, 1997, 2568, 1998, 2303, 1010, 3053, 2416, 5109, 2044, 2027, 4654, 19312, 3064, 2037, 16495, 2000, 1996, 3103, 1999, 1996, 2668, 4200, 7410, 1999, 1996, 2621, 1997, 6478, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9330124855041504, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "In the same way, in winter, when the lodge was full of old and young people, and through lack of attention the fire died down, some older person would call out, \u201cLook out for the skunk!\u201d which would be a warning to the boys to put some sticks on the fire.

The First shews the Thing desired by pointing at some certain Figure on the Drum, with the other they beat the Drum. I call that an Index , what Samuel Rheen calls a Bunch of Rings made of Metal . For when they make use of the Drum, they take a pretty large Ring, on which they hang several small ones, all which make up a Bunch. Tho' they also sometimes vary in this Point. One of those I have by me, is made of a thick Piece of Copper, about the bigness of a Crown Piece, with a square Hole in the middle; and instead of the small Rings, it is hung round about with little Copper Chains. The other is made of Brass, on which hangs a round Copper Plate, fastned to little Chains. I have also seen some made of Bones, resembling in shape the Greek Letter , with Rings hanging about them; and of other different Shapes. Mine. I have given you a Draught of, with the two Drums A. B. mark'd with G . However since they most commonly make use of a Ring (those Drums sent me by my Lord Chancellor, having no others than such) this is the reason, why the so often-mentioned anonymous M. S. has call'd them barely Rings. The Ring , says he, laid upon the Drum, did not stand still in any certain Place. Olaus Magnus calls them Brazen Serpents or Toads : For so they call those Rings, not that they are really such, or have any resemblance to Serpents or Toads, but because by those Rings they represent those Creatures, which they look upon to be very acceptable to the Devil, and whose Pictures they frequently make use of in their Magick. Peucerus calls them Frogs, They have likewise , says he, a brazen Frog, fastned to an Iron Bar : Perhaps because there is no great difference betwixt a Toad and a Frog. Which makes Olaus Petri say: In the Center they draw the Picture of their God, upon which they lay a Frog or some other Piece made of Brass. Torn us tells us that the Laplanders call it Arpa. The Index , says he, which they cali Arpa, is composed out of several Chain Rings, made of Copper, Iron, Brass or Silver : Which shews us, that they are not only made of Brass, but also of several other Metals. The Hammer they call that same Instrument, wherewith they beat the Drum, as we may see from what has been alledged out of Olqus Magnus and Johannes Torn us ; the Last of which says; They raise their Familiar Spirits by beating the Skin with a Hammer . But this Hammer must be imagined to have the least resemblance to a Smith's Hammer, as the Engraver of Olaus Magnus's had failly persuaded himself, but it is a certain Instrument so call'd by the Laplanders , and dedicated to this peculiar use, made of a Raindeer's Horn, branching out like a Fork; this being the Head of the Hammer, the rest the Handle. The true Shape of it I have given you in the same Cut, which contains the two Drums under A . and B . the Hammer being mark'd with H. With this Hammer they beat the Drum, not so much to make a Noise, but thereby to put the Ring, laid upon the Skin, into motion, so as to pass over the Pictures, till they are satisfied in what they look for. And thus I have given you a description of the Lapland Drum , with all its Appertinencies, viz . the Ring and the Hammer, such as they use among the Laplanders , subject to the Crown of Sweden . The Finlanders , bordering upon Norway , and subject to Denmark , do likewife use those Drums, but something different of those I have described to you just now; as is manifest from the Description given of them by the learned Olaus Wormius . It is however my Opinion, That the difference betwixt theirs and ours is not real, but rather accidental; arising from thence, that the Drum described by Wormius , was perhaps intended for some particular use. But let us see, for Wormius describes the Drum he makes mention of in the Description of his Study; The Lapland Drum , says he, which they use in their Magick, and by beating which, to a certain Tune, they pretend to discover many Things, is made of an oval Piece of Wood bollowed; its Length is about a Foot, its Bredth ten Inches, having six Ho'es cut in it with a Handle in the middle; whereby they hold it with the left Hand, whilst they beat with the Right. Over this they stretch a Skin. fasined to it with Nerves, painted with divers rude Shap'd Figures, drawn with Blood or some other Red Colour. Upon this lies a Piece of Brass in the Shape of a Rhomboides, somewhat convex, its Diameter being of two Inches, in the Middle of which, and on each Corner, bangs a small Brass Chain. The Instrument made of Bone, wherewith they beat the Drum, is about six Inches long. of the thickness of a little Finger, resembling the Latin T. The Laplanders use this Drum upon divers Occasions. and pretend to do great Matters by the help of it; which makes them have it in great Esteem, and keep it with much Reverence; they secure and wrap it up together with the Index and Hammer in a Lambskin. The Laplanders, says Samuel Rheen, set a great value upon their Drum, for they always keep it wrap'd up, together with the Rings and Hammer, in a Lamb-Skin . Thus it is in my Edition, tho' I have found it in another written Loomskin , which does not signifie a Lamb-Skin, but the Skin of a certain Bird, of the Water Fowl kind, and is in this Country called Loom. Wormius has given us a Description of it in his Study, and I shall perhaps have an Opportunity of describing it more at large, when I shall publish a Catalogue of the Rarities I preserve in my Study. Nay, they look upon this Drum as a Sacred Thing, which for this Reason, must not be touch'd by marriagable Women. No Woman , says the same author, that is come to Age of Maturity, is permitted to touch the Drum . If the Drum is to be removed from one Place to another, it is either carried last of all, and by the Hands of a Man, or else must be brought by a quite different Road, or some untrod Way. The Drum , says the same Author, never goes First, but Last of all, being carried by a Man, and not a Woman; somesimes thro' such Roads as were never made use of before . He gives us likewise the Reason of it, viz . Because they are afraid, that if any Body, but especially a Woman should pass the same way after it, would be in great danger of losing either her Health, or perhaps her Life; and this Hazard they run for the first three Days after; of which they do give you several Instances. They will tell you, says he, that if any Woman Kind, that is come to Age of Maturity, should travel the same Road, thro' which the Drum has been carried, within three Days before, the same would either dye immediately, or at least fall into some great Misfortune, and this they prove by many Instances . It seems as if the Devil would not have his Worship despised, but keeps a strict Hand over those who neglect his Rites, by punishing them severely, as far as God is pleased to permit; so that there is no great reason to doubt of the Truth of those Examples. Now, because it happens sometimes, Women must of necessity travel the same way, the Devil is somewhat more favourable to them, provided they pay him, as an Acknowledgment, a Ring of Brass, to the same Drum, that was carried that way before them. If it so happen , says the before-mentioned Author, that a Woman is forced to travel the same way, thro' which the Drum has been carried before, she is abliged to present a Brass Ring for the use of the said Drum . But since we have told you before, that according to their Opinion, they can effect strange Things, by the help of this Drum, we must take a view, what these Things are, and how they are performed. Olaus Petri mentions Three; relating either to their Hunting, to their Sacrifices, and the enquiring into far distant Matters. They have , says he, a threefold use for this Drum, in relation to their Hunting, Sacrifices, and the knowledge of Things at a distance. Samuel Rheen mentions Four. The First , To enquire what passes in other Places, tho' never so remote. The Second , To know the good and bad Success of any Undertaking, and what issue any Distemper is like to have. The Third , To Cure Diseases. The Fourth , To know what sort of Sacrifice their Gods are pleased with, and what kind of Beasts each God desires for his Sacrifice. They don't all use the same way or Ceremonies, in making their Enquiries. There are however several Circumstances which are to be observed by all. The First is, That they take care to stretch the Skin very stiff, by holding it near the Fire. They hold , says Olaus Petri, the Skin to the Fire, to make it Stiff . Secondly, That they don't always beat in one Place, but round about the Index or Ring. Thirdly, That they first begin to beat softly, and so continue stronger and stronger, till they have done their Business. Torn us says to this effect: He lifts up the Drum a little, and then beats round about the Index, first softly till the Index begin to stir and to move about, and when he finds it removed from the Place where it first laid, to one or the other side of the Drum, the Drummer beats harder and harder, till the Index Points at a certain Sign, from whence they may draw a Conjecture as to the Point they sought for . Another Ceremony they constantly observe, is, That he who beats the Drum, does it upon his Knees, not standing, and so do all the rest that are present. He that is skilful in this Art , says the same Author, falls down upon his Knees, as well as all the rest, and so he takes the Drum . As to the Occasions, of their beating the Drum, we having given you the last of them already; we must now proceed to the rest, the first of which is, to know, what is transacted in far distant Places; concerning which Olaus Magnus speaks to this effect; If they are solicitous to know in what Condition their Friends or Foes are, tho' at 500 or 1000 Leagues distance, they go to a Lap or Einlander, whom they know well skill'd in this Art, and by the means of a Present of a Linnen Sute of Cloths, or some Mony, they oblige him to try his Skill, to know what their Friends or Foes are doing at that time, and where they are . And so he proceeds to give an Account of the whole manner of doing it, of which we shall say A In Deser. Norway. more anon. Peter Clandi , speaking of the Finlanders under the Jurifdiction of Norway , says: They are so Skilful in this Art, that they can satisfie any Body, that wants to know, what other People are doing, at a great distance . He likewise relates the manner of performing it, and gives us an Instance, which happened at Bergen , the chief Trading City of Norway , which is to be seen upon record there, viz . in the publick Register of the German Factory: There was one John Delling , living in that City, in the Quality of a Factor, of a certain German Merchant, who meeting one time with a Friend of his called James Smausuend , who had a certain Norwegian Finlaplander in his Company, he ask'd him, whether he could tell him, what his Master was then doing in Germany? The Finlaplander having answered him he could, began immediately to make a great Noise, as if he were Drunk, then leaping and turning himself several times round in a Circle, he fell upon the Ground without any Sense or Motion; after he had continued thus for some time, he recovered out of his Trance, started up, and told him, what his Master was transacting in Germany ; which being immediately entred into the Register of the German Merchants, was found, upon enquity made afterwards, to agree with what the Finlaplander had told him. A memorable Instance, which deserves the more Credit, as being confirmed by publick Authority. There are besides this many more Inslances of this kind, related upon the Credit and Experience of those now living, among which, that which happned to Johannes Torn us deserves to be taken particular Notice of; a certain Laplander , who is still living, having told him all what happned to him in his first Journey into Lapland ; he never having seen him before, These are his Words; He told me truly and exactly every thing that bad happned to me in my Journey into Eapland: And, notwithstanding I was sensible of the Truth of what the Laplander had told me, concerning this journey, I told him, that what he had said was altogether false; for fear he sbould glory in his Diabolical Art, or rely upon it, as a means to investigate Truth . There is not the least shew of Reason, to Question the Truth of this Relation, being founded upon the Authority' of a Person not in the least addicted to Superstition, who speaks by his own Experience. The Authors however differ in the Method, used in making those Discoveries. Olaus Magnus describes it thus: The Drummer goes into some private Room, accompanied only by one Person, besides his own Wife. Then by beating upon the Anvil with his Hammer be moves the Brazen Frog or Serpent about the Figures, muttering at the same time certain Words; till he falls into a Trance, lying extended on the Ground, as if Dead: His Companion in the mean while taking great Care, that no Gnat, Flie or any other living Creature touch him. By the force of his Charms, his Soul is by some evil D mon or other carryed into some distant Place, from whence he brings back (as a Token that be has executed his Commission) a Ring, Knife, or some such Thing; which, so soon as he rises from the Ground, he shews, and declares to his Companion. Peter Claudi gives us the following Account of it: He falls upon the Ground without any Life or Motion, turning quite yellow or Black in the Face. Thus he continues for One or more Hours, according to the distance of the Place, of which enquiry is to he made. When he recovers from this Trance, he is able to tell what passes in that Place, and what those People transact there, of which Enquiry was made . Here no mention is made either of a Drum, Song, his Companions, or any Tokens of the Performance of the Business; which difference must be attributed to this, that each Author gives an Account of what seem'd most worth taking notice of to him, without excluding the rest, mentioned by others; so that from what has been said already, the use of the Drum can scarce be call'd in question; but what Olaus Petri relates of the Drums, made for this particular use, viz .

The beforementioned Author proceeds thus: This done, the Patient must make a Vow of a certain Sacrifice, of a Raindeer, Buil, He-Goat or Ram, or something else of this Kind, to be offered to some certain Storjunkare, dwelling in some certain Mountain or other . Neither is it left to the Choice of the Patient, but to the direction of the Drum-beater; it being his Province to prescribe, what they ought to do. Whatever the Drummer orders the Patient to do , says the same Author, he must perform, and either Sacrifice immediately, or at least promise to offer such a Sacrifice at a certain appointed Time . For it is the Business of him, who beats the Drum, to enquire (as I told you before) which of the Gods the Sacrifice is to be offered to, and what kind of Sacrifice will be acceptable to him; for the same Sacrifice is not pleasing to every one of their Gods, neither is the same God satisfied with one kind of Sacrifices at all times; so that the choice of it depends on the Manager of the Drum, whose direction the sick Person is to follow. The manner of performing it, is thus described by Samuel Rheen: When they pretend to Cure any Distemper by the help of the Drum, it is done in the following manner: The Patient must present the Drummer with two Rings, as a Reward for his Pains, one of Brass, the other of Silver; both which he tyes to his right Arm. The Drummer, after having put those two Rings in the same Bunch, which commonly is made use of, as often as the Drum is employed for those Purposes, beats the said Drum, singing all the while, as do likewise all the Men and Women there present, the first with a loud Voice, the latter somewhat lower . From the Motion and Position of the Rings, the Drum-beater makes his Conjecture, as we told you before. Lundius gives the following Account concerning this Method: If a Laplander happen to fall Sick in the Lapmark of Uma , they send for the next Neighbour, whom they think most expert in the management of the Drum. The first Thing to be done after his coming is, to Sacrifice one of the best Raindeer, belonging to the sick Body, or to his best Friend; then he begins to beat his Drum, and falling on the Ground, remains there for some time unmoveable, his Body being as hard as a Stone. In the mean while the rest there present sing a certain Song, which they have been taught by him beforehand, till he recovers his Senses, arises, takes up his Drum, and holding it up to his Head, beats it softly for some small time. After which he sits down very pensive, and begins to give them an Account of his Transactions; he tells them, that he has passed thro' the Body of the Terrestrial Globe, where he has met with the Antipodes, being conducted by his Genius, among a People of a very handsome and venerable Aspect; those People, he says, being advertised of his coming, had shut their Gates against him, but that by the affistance of his Genius, he had got among them thro' a Hole, where he had seen something belonging to the Sick Person, either his Hat, his Shoes, or perhaps his Mittens, or some such like Thing, which he was either able or unable to bring away. Their gencral Opinion is, That if the Drummer did bring it away, there is great Hopes of the Patients recovery, but if not, that he will Dye, and endure a great deal of Pain. And because they are fully persuaded, that the Soul of the Drummer does actually leave his Body and is carried to the Place he Names to them; they say that his Soul is brought back by his Genius over the highest Rocks and Mountains, with such swiftness, that the Sand and Stones doe flye about like Hail. Mr. Paul Venetus relates something not unlike this of the Tartars of the Province of Areladam .

The Natives , says Olaus Petri Niurenius, are so healthful, that they neither have nor want any Physicians . And Samuel Rheen, The Laplanders are of a strong Constitution, being seldon afflicted with any of those Distempers which are frequent among other Nations . They scarce know what Sickness is, not so much as those Epidemical Distempers which sometimes afflict whole Nations. There is no such thing as putrid or burning Fevers, or the Plague in Lapland. In Lapland, says the same Author, you meet with no burning Fevers or the Plague ; nay if any Contagion be transferred thither, it loses its Virulency. Qlaus Petri Niurenis says, Some years ago a Pestilential Contagion was transported into Lapland, but no body was kill'd by it, except the Women that in Spinning choused it; for the coldncss of the Northern Climate soon disperses the viralent Vapours . Their only Epidemical Distemper is sore Eyes, which are often the Forerunners of Blindness; this is attributed to their constant sitting in their Huts, from their Infancy, which are both Winter and Summer pestred with Smoak. Their ordinary Disease , says he, is Sore Eyes; for the continual Smoak in their Huts, is so offensive to them, that most lose their Eye-sight as they grow old. Eric Plantin attributes the cause of it, besides the Smoak, to the light of the Fire. The Laplanders, says he, grow for the most part Blind at last, without question, because from their very Infancy they sit constantly in the Smoak and near the Fire . The same is confirmed by Olaus Petri Niurenius the Elder: Their greatest Trouble and Misery is, that they lose their Eye-sight when they grow old; this being a Disease more to them than any other Nation. This proceeds from their continual looking upon the Fire from their Infancy, which burns Day and Night, in the Winter and Summer, in the midst of their Huts . a Lundius is of Opinion, that the Mountaineers are Blinded by the Violent reflection of the Sun Beams upon the Ice and Snow of the Mountains. They are also sometimes troubled with the Plurisy, Inflammation of the Lungs, Pains in the Back, and Giddiness in the Head. Mr. Eric Plantin , in his Answer to my Letter says, Their most common Distempers are, the Pleurisy, Pains in the Brest and Back, and Dizziness in the Hend . And sometimes also the Small-Pox; for he adds, Sometimes they are inflicted with the Small-Pox . As they are subject but to few Distempers, so they \u00e0re Strangers to Physicians. Their universal Remedy against Internal Distempers are the Roots of a certain Moss call'd by them Jerth , or for want of those, the Stalks of Angelica. Their general Medicine, says Plantin, against any Internal Distempers is the Root of Moss, call'd Jerth; instead of which they substitute in those Places where it grows not, the Angelica, call'd by them Fadna, which is to be found every where. Lundius adds the Beavers Kidneys steep'd in Brandy. They boil the Angelica in Whey of Raindeers Milk, as I told you it was their Custom in that Chapter of their Diet. Samuel Rheen says of this, They use it likewise for a Medicine. Against the Scurvy , says Lundius , they drink Raindeers Blood; when they are afflicted with the Tooth-Ach (which is but seldom) they make a Tooth-Pick of the Wood of a Tree, which has been struck with Lightning, with this they pick their Teeth till they Bleed. Against the Pain in the Back, they anoint themselves with Grease of Serpents, or wear Beavers Teeth on the back-side of their Girdle; others have a Superstition, that if they turn themselves round extended upon the Ground, the first time they hear it Thunder in the Spring, this Cures all the Aches in the Back. When they are afflicted with Pains in their Limbs, they apply fired Chips, which occasioning an Ulcer, they pretend by that means to draw the viscous Humour thither, and to mitigate the Pain. Their common Remedy is , says Plantin, to take fired Chips, or the Moss growing on the Birch-Tree; this they apply to the Place where the Pain lies; if they hit it right, the Moss will fall off, of it self, and the subsequent ulcer removes the Pain. To their Wounds they use no other Plaisters, than the Rosin, which the Trees sweat out. If they are wounded , says he, they apply Rosin instead of a Plaister . If their Limbs are benummed with Cold, their Raindeers Cheese supplies them with an Infallible Medicine; they thrust a red hot Iron into the Cheese, and with the Oil, that distils from thence, anoint the affected Part, with incredible Success. Some apply the Cheese it self, cut in thin Slices; If their Limbs be spoiled by the Cold , says Olaus Petri, this Cheese they cut in thin Slices, and appyed warm is a present Remedy . They likewise boil this Cheese in Milk, against a Cough, and all other Distempers of the Breast and Lungs, arising from Cold; they drink it Hot. It is also a good Stomachick to rectifie the Indigestion of the Stomach, occasioned by drinking too much Water. This Cheese, says Olaus Petri, is good for the Stomach, when it is spoiled with taking too much Water . For the rest, as they are seldom troubled with any Distempers, so they commonly arrive to a great Age. As the Laplanders, says Samucl Rheen, are not subject to any dangerous Distempers, so they grom old, even to a great Age . He says some live above a Hundred, but most Seventy, Eighty or Ninery Years; notwithstanding which, they lose not much of their natural Vigour, being able to traverse the highest Mountains, and thickest Woods, and manage all other Affairs as before, neither get they any gray Hairs till they are very Old; They seldom grow Gray, says he. So that most of the Laplanders Dye rather for Age, than by any Distemper. But when ever any one is dangerously Ill, either by Age, or some Distemper, they have recourse to their Drum, to know whether he will recover or die, as I have told you before concerning their Drum. Mr. Matthias Steuchius, in his Letter written to me, has these Words: I remember, that a certain Laplander told me, that they can by their Drum, know the Hour and manner of Death of the Patient . And Eric Plantin says; They pretend to enquire by their Drum, whether the Patient will Live or Dye . After they are satisfied, he cannot live long, if any Pious and good Christians are prelent, they exhort the dying Person, to think of God and Christ. I was told, says Eric Plantin, by an old gray Headed Laplander, who formerly went to School at Pitha, that those who are well instructed in the Christian Religion, used to exhort the Patient to remember God . But such as are no great Admirers of the Christian Religion, are careful only about the Funeral Feast, which they begin sometimes, before the Patient is expired. One Thomas, says Steuchius, a rich Laplander, being desperately Ill, beyond all Hopes of Recovery, sent for his Friends and Relations. These finding him to draw near his end, went to an Inn, where those that travel to Norway and Jempterland, used to lodge; there they stay'd a whole Day, which they spent it drinking of Strong-Beer and Brandy, the best Sacrifice they could make him, whilst yet alive, and then returning to the Hut, found him Dead . This being an Instance of a later Date, gives us sufficient reason to make due Reflections upon the just Complaints inserted in the introduction to the Grant of K. Gustave Adolph for creating a Lapland School, where among other Matters he says of the Laplanders: Those which live in the remotest Parts, among the Mountains of Norway, if they are Sick, and destitute of all Comfort, there being no Body, who administers the Sacrament to them, but they Dye without Consolation or Absolution. He alledges the Reason; Because the Devil at that nick of Time makes use of all his Tomptations, to become Masier of their Souls , viz. The Devil insinuates into them, to neglect all these Things, as vain Inventions, so that instead of those of their Friends that are good Christians, they send for such, as take more Care of their Belly's, than the Salvation of the Sick Person. But whenever any of them Dies, let the Distemper be what it will, they all forsake the Hut, where the Dead Carcass lies; it being their Opinion, that there is something remaining still of the Dead (as I told you before) such as the ancient Latines call'd Manes , and that not always of a Benign, but sometimes of a malignant Nature, which makes them dread any Dead Carcass; They are fearful of the Dead, says Samuel Rheen, for no sooner does any Body dye, but they leave the Place the same Day .", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 5001, 22691, 2015, 1010, 26206, 2027, 13595, 1037, 2307, 3066, 1997, 26479, 1010, 2664, 5959, 1037, 2307, 3745, 1997, 2740, 1012, 1996, 12493, 1010, 2758, 19330, 20559, 9004, 3089, 9152, 5397, 20447, 1010, 2024, 2061, 2740, 3993, 1010, 2008, 2027, 4445, 2031, 4496, 2215, 2151, 11572, 1012, 1998, 5212, 1054, 21030, 2078, 1010, 1996, 5001, 22691, 2015, 2024, 1997, 1037, 2844, 4552, 1010, 2108, 7367, 19932, 21358, 29301, 2098, 2007, 2151, 1997, 2216, 4487, 13473, 8737, 2545, 2029, 2024, 6976, 2426, 2060, 3741, 1012, 2027, 18782, 2113, 2054, 15556, 2003, 1010, 2025, 2061, 2172, 2004, 2216, 16311, 2389, 4487, 13473, 8737, 2545, 2029, 2823, 21358, 29301, 2878, 3741, 1012, 2045, 2003, 2053, 2107, 2518, 2004, 2404, 14615, 2030, 5255, 9016, 2015, 1010, 2030, 1996, 11629, 1999, 5001, 3122, 1012, 1999, 5001, 3122, 1010, 2758, 1996, 2168, 3166, 1010, 2017, 3113, 2007, 2053, 5255, 9016, 2015, 2030, 1996, 11629, 1025, 29349, 2065, 2151, 9530, 15900, 3258, 2022, 4015, 16215, 8939, 2121, 1010, 2009, 12386, 2049, 6819, 6820, 7770, 5666, 1012, 1053, 28128, 9004, 3089, 9152, 5397, 8977, 2758, 1010, 2070, 2086, 3283, 1037, 20739, 9463, 19909, 9530, 15900, 3258, 2001, 9687, 2046, 5001, 3122, 1010, 2021, 2053, 2303, 2001, 3102, 1005, 1040, 2011, 2009, 1010, 3272, 1996, 2308, 2008, 1999, 9419, 16480, 13901, 2009, 1025, 2005, 1996, 3147, 12273, 4757, 1997, 1996, 2642, 4785, 2574, 28736, 2015, 1996, 13434, 4765, 12436, 27757, 2015, 1012, 2037, 2069, 16311, 2389, 4487, 13473, 8737, 2121, 2003, 14699, 2159, 1010, 2029, 2024, 2411, 1996, 23993, 2015, 1997, 26290, 1025, 2023, 2003, 7108, 2000, 2037, 5377, 3564, 1999, 2037, 23326, 1010, 2013, 2037, 22813, 1010, 2029, 2024, 2119, 3467, 1998, 2621, 20739, 5596, 2007, 15488, 10441, 2243, 1012, 2037, 6623, 4295, 1010, 2758, 2002, 1010, 2003, 14699, 2159, 1025, 2005, 1996, 27222, 15488, 10441, 2243, 1999, 2037, 23326, 1010, 2003, 2061, 5805, 2000, 2068, 1010, 2008, 2087, 4558, 2037, 3239, 1011, 4356, 2004, 2027, 4982, 2214, 1012, 4388, 3269, 2378, 12332, 1996, 3426, 1997, 2009, 1010, 4661, 1996, 15488, 10441, 2243, 1010, 2000, 1996, 2422, 1997, 1996, 2543, 1012, 1996, 5001, 22691, 2015, 1010, 2758, 2002, 1010, 4982, 2005, 1996, 2087, 2112, 6397, 2012, 2197, 1010, 2302, 3160, 1010, 2138, 2013, 2037, 2200, 22813, 2027, 4133, 7887, 1999, 1996, 15488, 10441, 2243, 1998, 2379, 1996, 2543, 1012, 1996, 2168, 2003, 4484, 2011, 19330, 20559, 9004, 3089, 9152, 5397, 20447, 1996, 6422, 1024, 2037, 4602, 4390, 1998, 14624, 2003, 1010, 2008, 2027, 4558, 2037, 3239, 1011, 4356, 2043, 2027, 4982, 2214, 1025, 2023, 2108, 1037, 4295, 2062, 2000, 2068, 2084, 2151, 2060, 3842, 1012, 2023, 10951, 2013, 2037, 27222, 2559, 2588, 1996, 2543, 2013, 2037, 22813, 1010, 2029, 7641, 2154, 1998, 2305, 1010, 1999, 1996, 3467, 1998, 2621, 1010, 1999, 1996, 12930, 1997, 2037, 23326, 1012, 1037, 21860, 4173, 2003, 1997, 5448, 1010, 2008, 1996, 3137, 22862, 2024, 20641, 2011, 1996, 6355, 9185, 1997, 1996, 3103, 13110, 2588, 1996, 3256, 1998, 4586, 1997, 1996, 4020, 1012, 2027, 2024, 2036, 2823, 11587, 2007, 1996, 20228, 9496, 6508, 1010, 21733, 1997, 1996, 8948, 1010, 20398, 1999, 1996, 2067, 102]}, {"score": 0.9588139653205872, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Formerly the neglect these miserable Wretches shew of their Salyation, was in a great measure attributed to the Ignorance and Carelesness of the Country Clergy; but since by the Care of the Swedish Kings, a Yearly Synod has been Convocated at Rival , for the regulation of Church-Affairs, and Examination of the Clergy-Men; it has been found by experience, that besides their unfitness for Devotion, by reason of the constant Fatigues they are forced to undergo, their antient Idolatry and Superstition, has taken so deep root among them, as not to be quite extirpated by the Art of Man; for such is their Inclination for Sorcery, that they are of Opinion their Cattel cannot thrive without it; for which reason, Fathers and Mothers, among these Peasants, are as careful to instruct their Children in it, as we do in the Cathechism and other good Morals. To elude the Effects of Charms, they never kill a Beast, or make a Slaughter, but they throw some part away, upon which the effect of the Charm is to fall; nay, they are so far entangled in Superstition, that if within a few Weeks after Baptism, the Child happen to fall ill, or pine away, they Rebaptize it, alledging, that the first Name was not agreable to its Constitution, tho' very severe Laws have been enacted against it. The worst of all is, that they are so Tenacious of these Superstitions, and so obstinate in the perseverance of their antient Customs, that nothing is able to divert them from it. Of this there have been several Instances of late Years; for these Peasants, as I told you before, being not permitted to purchase any Lands, but obliged to live upon the Allotments granted to them by their Lords, for the bare sustenance of their Families, will sometimes cut or burn down some Woods, and Manure the Ground, which produces good Wheat; this they hide for Sale; but if they happen to be catch'd, they are strip'd to the middle, and ty'd to a Post, where they are soundly whipt with a Switch, till the Blood issues forth on all Sides; I say, there are many Instances of such among the Livonian Peasants, who rather than redeem this Chastisement by a small pecuniary Mulct of about 18 or 16 Pence, have chosen to submit readily to the Punishment, alledging, that rather than introduce any Novelty of this Kind, they would suffer the same Chastisement their Fore-fathers used to do before them.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 3839, 1996, 19046, 2122, 13736, 23277, 3388, 8376, 2016, 2860, 1997, 2037, 16183, 26139, 3258, 1010, 2001, 1999, 1037, 2307, 5468, 7108, 2000, 1996, 18173, 1998, 2729, 4244, 2791, 1997, 1996, 2406, 11646, 1025, 2021, 2144, 2011, 1996, 2729, 1997, 1996, 4467, 5465, 1010, 1037, 12142, 15374, 2038, 2042, 9530, 6767, 12921, 2012, 6538, 1010, 2005, 1996, 7816, 1997, 2277, 1011, 3821, 1010, 1998, 7749, 1997, 1996, 11646, 1011, 2273, 1025, 2009, 2038, 2042, 2179, 2011, 3325, 1010, 2008, 4661, 2037, 29439, 2791, 2005, 13347, 1010, 2011, 3114, 1997, 1996, 5377, 16342, 2015, 2027, 2024, 3140, 2000, 13595, 1010, 2037, 3424, 4765, 10282, 4017, 2854, 1998, 3565, 16643, 3508, 1010, 2038, 2579, 2061, 2784, 7117, 2426, 2068, 1010, 2004, 2025, 2000, 2022, 3243, 4654, 3775, 14536, 4383, 2011, 1996, 2396, 1997, 2158, 1025, 2005, 2107, 2003, 2037, 21970, 2005, 2061, 19170, 2854, 1010, 2008, 2027, 2024, 1997, 5448, 2037, 4937, 9834, 3685, 25220, 2302, 2009, 1025, 2005, 2029, 3114, 1010, 11397, 1998, 10756, 1010, 2426, 2122, 13193, 1010, 2024, 2004, 6176, 2000, 16021, 18300, 2037, 2336, 1999, 2009, 1010, 2004, 2057, 2079, 1999, 1996, 4937, 5369, 5428, 6491, 1998, 2060, 2204, 25288, 1012, 2000, 3449, 12672, 1996, 3896, 1997, 24044, 1010, 2027, 2196, 3102, 1037, 6841, 1010, 2030, 2191, 1037, 14574, 1010, 2021, 2027, 5466, 2070, 2112, 2185, 1010, 2588, 2029, 1996, 3466, 1997, 1996, 11084, 2003, 2000, 2991, 1025, 29349, 1010, 2027, 2024, 2061, 2521, 4372, 27898, 1999, 3565, 16643, 3508, 1010, 2008, 2065, 2306, 1037, 2261, 3134, 2044, 18336, 1010, 1996, 2775, 4148, 2000, 2991, 5665, 1010, 2030, 7222, 2185, 1010, 2027, 2128, 3676, 13876, 4697, 2009, 1010, 2035, 28002, 1010, 2008, 1996, 2034, 2171, 2001, 2025, 12943, 16416, 3468, 2000, 2049, 4552, 1010, 27793, 1005, 2200, 5729, 4277, 2031, 2042, 11955, 2114, 2009, 1012, 1996, 5409, 1997, 2035, 2003, 1010, 2008, 2027, 2024, 2061, 2702, 20113, 1997, 2122, 3565, 16643, 9285, 1010, 1998, 2061, 27885, 16643, 12556, 1999, 1996, 2566, 3366, 21998, 1997, 2037, 3424, 4765, 8205, 1010, 2008, 2498, 2003, 2583, 2000, 27345, 2068, 2013, 2009, 1012, 1997, 2023, 2045, 2031, 2042, 2195, 12107, 1997, 2397, 2086, 1025, 2005, 2122, 13193, 1010, 2004, 1045, 2409, 2017, 2077, 1010, 2108, 2025, 7936, 2000, 5309, 2151, 4915, 1010, 2021, 14723, 2000, 2444, 2588, 1996, 2035, 4140, 8163, 4379, 2000, 2068, 2011, 2037, 8140, 1010, 2005, 1996, 6436, 10514, 16173, 6651, 1997, 2037, 2945, 1010, 2097, 2823, 3013, 2030, 6402, 2091, 2070, 5249, 1010, 1998, 2158, 5397, 1996, 2598, 1010, 2029, 7137, 2204, 10500, 1025, 2023, 2027, 5342, 2005, 5096, 1025, 2021, 2065, 2027, 4148, 2000, 2022, 4608, 1005, 1040, 1010, 2027, 2024, 6167, 1005, 1040, 2000, 1996, 2690, 1010, 1998, 5939, 1005, 1040, 2000, 1037, 2695, 1010, 2073, 2027, 2024, 2614, 2135, 11473, 2102, 2007, 1037, 6942, 1010, 6229, 1996, 2668, 3314, 5743, 2006, 2035, 3903, 1025, 1045, 2360, 1010, 2045, 2024, 2116, 12107, 1997, 2107, 2426, 1996, 22135, 12488, 2078, 13193, 1010, 2040, 2738, 2084, 2417, 21564, 2023, 15775, 29472, 13665, 2011, 1037, 2235, 21877, 10841, 6200, 2854, 14163, 15472, 2102, 1997, 2055, 2324, 2030, 2385, 7279, 102]}, {"score": 0.6849836111068726, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Some of the relatively unsuccessful cases are perhaps easiest to analyze first.

The borders of an iron wound are pressed first on one side, then on the other, and at the same time it is blown upon. It may also be soaked with urine and covered with a thin piece of inner birchbark. Some Lapps boil nails in water, then wash the wound with this water three times. 3 The Lapps also used alum-water (ANDE IN, Oulun Lehti 1881, n:o l; U.). Others heat a birchbranch until a sticky, brown liquid begins to ooze forth and then apply this liquid to the wound (U.). The Inari-Lapps put the aried chest-fat of a bear or \u201csettled\u201d reindeer or sheep fat on such a wound; a mixture of pitch and melted reindeer or dog fat may also do. In case of a rupture of the vein in a hand, the wound is closed with a heated knife. In the summer, the Inari reindeer-Lapps wash a larger wound with water; in the winter they wash and rub the wound itself with snow. They take salt in their mouths, then press the wound with their tongue, at the same time sucking out blood, which is spat out. Blood is not sucked out of large wounds, they are covered with salt or salt water. The wound may be sprinkled with the spore-dust of a puffball ( Lycoperdon bovista ), 1 Similarly QVIGSTAD, Lapp. Heilkunde, p. 105. -- Enonteki\u00f6: the puffball ( st alu-pur's\u00e2 , kied'de-spab'b\u00e2 ) is placed on the wound (Aili Leinon kok. 1947). mixed with pitch-water ( pihk'k\u00e2-t s ahttsi ); the latter is obtained when boiling pinepitch in a small quantity of water. The mixture is put on the wound and covered with a bandage (I. reind.-L.). Fresh pine-pitch is an excellent remedy on wounds; it is usually covered with a thin piece of inner birchbark (U.). The Kolt-Lapps also use pine-pitch or a mixture of boiled spruce-pitch (or tar) and candle-wax. -- The wound may also be covered with a mouse-skin, hair inwards, which has previously been sprinkled with the spore-dust of a puffball; it is tied with rags. An injured finger may be covered with a leather sheath spread with spore-dust. If a wound will not stop bleeding it has to be strewn with ground coffee. Another method is to let some blood drop onto a red-hot cobblestone; the emerging steam will stanch the flow of blood (I. reind.-L.). The Utsjoki-Lapps had still another method: a hole was drilled in a tree and some blood from the wound was poured into the hole, which was then obstructed with a peg. -- The wound may also be covered with a thin membrane from a hide 1 Similarly QVIGSTAD, p. 99. or with a film of birchbark. 2 Similarly DRAKE, p. 260. Twenty-four hours later the membrane begins to tighten, and it is then changed. A large wound, e.g. one made with an ax in the foot, which will not stop bleeding, may in winter be healed with a thin, still-warm slice of meat or the lights of a recently slaughtered reindeer. In some regions such reindeer are slaughtered by being stabbed in the neck and not in the heart as is the usual way; the patient should in addition eat a piece of meat, raw and unsalted. Cold meat is heated in warm water. The wound is then covered with a piece of rag (northeast I. reind.-L.). The Utsjoki-Lapps place a slice of frozen lights on such a wound. Stanching the flow of blood is called v ar\u00e2 pis'se h te\u00e4bme . 3 There is a Lapp woman in Enonteki\u00f6 who is able to stanch the bleeding of a person living in another locality, if only she is informed of his/her name (Aili Leinon kok. 1947). -- A live frog is pressed against a suppurating wound (e.g. for as long as it takes to make coffee). A fresh or suppurating wound may also be healed with boiled tar. 4 For suppurating wounds also pitch oil (E.). The Kolt-Lapps use the thin membrane underneath the birchbark (\u201cjulmu\u201d) on such a wound. The wound can also be soaked with lye obtained from ashes. -- Bleeding wounds occasioned by the bites of dogs or other animals are stanched with salt; the wound is then smeared with sour fat and bandaged. If a hunter is bitten by a bear, the wounds have to be rubbed with the bear's bile, and the rest of the bile is drunk by the bitten hunter (Sodankyl\u00e4-Lapps). -- Scabs are smeared once a day with reindeer-marrow or sour fat to prevent them from chapping. This is probably what Fellman refers to when he writes that wounds and abscesses are healed with reindeer-marrow or tar and pine-pitch melted in fat. 1 J.F., III, p. 163; compare DRAKE, pp. 261-2: Fat or pitch.

Hot ashes inside a woolen stocking or mitten are also applied (E.). 14) The hot water of boiled, wild rosemary is poured into a bowl and the patient keeps his head over the bowl, covered with a cloth (K.). 15) A frog is wrapped in a thin piece of cloth and kept on the cheek until it dies (I. reind.-L.). The paws of a black cat are bound with four pieces of rag, to prevent it from clawing.

It is heated on the fire and then pressed on the cheek by the aching tooth. 17) The tendon by the shoulder-blades in the back is pressed hard (U.). The painfull spot is pressed with the thumb and the forefinger, thereafter the fingers follow the tendon in the same way below the ear and to the neck, until they reach the spinal column (I. fisher-L.). 18) Another method is to bloodlet the hand by the thumb (and also the neck) on the same side as the toothache (E.). -- Bloodletting was formerly done with a large knife, which the Lapps struck with another knife. 1 ANDELIN, Oulun Lehti 1881, n:o 1.

He should be given a cold compress (snow inside a piece of cloth) on his eyes and should lie down in the shelter or at home for at least 24 hours. To prevent snow blindness ( t s\u00e2lbme-sud'dom ; t s\u00e2lmiht suovg\u00e2 h tuvveh , I. t salm eh koddojeh ) in early spring, the Lapps remain in a dark stable or look inside through a steaming sheep-barndoor until their eyes begin to fill with tears. If there are no sheep, they will wash their eyes with their own, warm urine, as many as three or four times a day. Other Lapps dye a piece of cotton fabric black and make a cap ( pe\u00e4i've-suo 'g\u00e2 ) which they press down to the nostrils on bright days. The ordinary cap is placed on top of the black one (I. reind.-L.). Snow blindness may also be avoided if the eyes are not washed between February and Midsummer (I. fisher-L.), or if the lower eyelid is covered with soot (E.). The Utsjoki-Lapps used alum water. 1 ANDELIN, Oulun Lehti, 1881, n:o 1. -- A few drops of mother's milk are dripped into a sore eye, after which it is covered with a woolen cloth and blown upon. Another method is to throw cold water in the patient's eyes unexpectedly, e.g. when he opens a door (U.). If the disease of the eyes is due to cold, they should be rubbed with the water obtained by boiling white, black and red stones. 2 ANDELIN, Oulun Lehti, 1881, n:o 1. A kind of cataract ( ts\u00e2lmi l anst\u00e2rduvveh ) may form in the eyes in clear spring weather. When the patient enters a smoky hut, the cataract will break as a result of the flow of tears, and it is licked away (I. reind.-L.). The real cataract ( sm\u00e4i'ti ) is healed by boiling birchashes in water. When the dregs have settled a pin is dipped into the surface layer (= lye) and one drop is let fall on the cataract. A minute amount of mercury has the same effect (U.). Formerly a louse was placed in the eye; it was believed to wear out the cataract when it moved. 3 Oulun W.-S. 1857, n:o 34. Tobacco-spittle may also be put in an eye afflicted with a cataract. 1 OINONEN, Kolmen valtaku nan ota-Lappia, p. 169. If the eye was injured while looking at a solar eclipse, it was healed by looking into a well or a copper kettle in moonlight, where the reflected image of the moon was shining. 2 PAULAHARJU, Taka-Lappia, p. 164. Some Lapps suffer from night blindness . The Kolt-Lapps believe that this is due to the fact that newborn children are brought at once close to the dazzling hearth. 3 Idem. Kolttain mailta, p. 175. A bit of dirt in the eye is taken away by blinking the eye in lukewarm water. At the worst, some skillful old woman will turn the eyelid inside out ( forgu h tih ) and take away the particle with the tip of her tongue. Some Lapps have tweezers to remove dirt particles; they may also be taken out with a golden ring. The Utsjoki-Lapps aripped mother's milk in the eye.

Another, apparently more perfect method is to place two thin wooden splints on each side of the sore place, after which the healer cuts off the splints, turns the ends three times around the painful spot, and then throws them on the fire. The tendon of a reindeer's hind-leg ( vienn-suonn a ) is also used. One places it untied on the painful place, while pressing with a knife on both sides and reading \u201cwords;\u201d thereafter the tendon is cut in two. A painful tendon is also cured by cutting off a birch-twig in three points above it, while the patient asks each time: \u201cwhat do you cut?\u201d The healer answers: \u201cI cut off the vienn a ( = pain).\u201d This is done on three consecutive days. 1 Notes of E.A.

It is not difficult to understand that thunder and lightning, which sometimes kills men and animals, sets fire to trees and splits mountains, in these respects must be regarded as a malevolent being. But on the other hand the thunder which is followed by the fertilizing rain, important for the growth of grass and reindeer-moss, and purifies the heavy and oppressive atmosphere, from these points view appears also as a being benevolent to mankind. He expels the bad spirits or trolls which according to primitive belief fill the air and cause sickness. All the Samek seem to have agreed on this point. According to Leem there was a saying among the Norwegian Lapps that \u201cif there were no thunder the trolls would ruin the world\u201d. They also said that during a thunderstorm the trolls were seen running about in the forest for fear until they found a hollow tree, where they tried to conceal themselves; but the tree was thereupon set on fire by the lightning 15 14 Fellman, I, 599. . The Russian ethnologist Charuzin, who in the first place gives us information about the ideas of the Russian Lapps, tells us much the same about them as Leem, Rheen, H\u00f6gstr\u00f6m and Fellman do about those of the Scandinavian and Finnish Lapps. \u201cThunder is\u201d, says Charuzin, \u201cboth a good and a bad god; he is good because he persecutes the evil wizards in whom a bad power is concealed.\u201d Aijeke is honoured by the Lapps, he continues, because, as they relate, he has in his hands power over the life and death, the good and ill health of men. He pursues the evil spirits who are ill-disposed to the Lapps, shooting his arrows at them where they live in the rocks and mountains, or in the depths of the lakes. The Lapps have recourse to him when they believe that wizards have bewitched their reindeer herds, in order to revenge themselves. Aijeke pursues the evil-doer; sometimes he finds the wizard and then he kills him. Aijeke dwells in the air, he hears the utterances of men even when the Lapps believe that he will not hear them. He punishes them for their crimes. In addition to the belief that the thunder itself is a divinity, we find even among the Russian Lapps the idea that the peals during a thunderstorm are due to the arrows which the god of thunder shoots against the wizards 16 15 Leem, 506. .", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2004, 3544, 2013, 1996, 2682, 8635, 1010, 1996, 2643, 1997, 8505, 2001, 22876, 2426, 1996, 5001, 4523, 2004, 2426, 2116, 2060, 2896, 7243, 2104, 1037, 2048, 10371, 7814, 1024, 6576, 2002, 2001, 5240, 2004, 1037, 2204, 1998, 25786, 1010, 6576, 2004, 1037, 1031, 20165, 1033, 2919, 2030, 3287, 6767, 16136, 7746, 2108, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2025, 3697, 2000, 3305, 2008, 8505, 1998, 7407, 1010, 2029, 2823, 8563, 2273, 1998, 4176, 1010, 4520, 2543, 2000, 3628, 1998, 19584, 4020, 1010, 1999, 2122, 17475, 2442, 2022, 5240, 2004, 1037, 3287, 6767, 16136, 2108, 1012, 2021, 2006, 1996, 2060, 2192, 1996, 8505, 2029, 2003, 2628, 2011, 1996, 10768, 28228, 3669, 6774, 4542, 1010, 2590, 2005, 1996, 3930, 1997, 5568, 1998, 29495, 1011, 10636, 1010, 1998, 16405, 3089, 14213, 1996, 3082, 1998, 28558, 7224, 1010, 2013, 2122, 2685, 3193, 3544, 2036, 2004, 1037, 2108, 25786, 2000, 14938, 1012, 2002, 4654, 11880, 2015, 1996, 2919, 8633, 2030, 27980, 2029, 2429, 2000, 10968, 6772, 6039, 1996, 2250, 1998, 3426, 15556, 1012, 2035, 1996, 2168, 2243, 4025, 2000, 2031, 3530, 2006, 2023, 2391, 1012, 2429, 2000, 3389, 2213, 2045, 2001, 1037, 3038, 2426, 1996, 5046, 5001, 4523, 2008, 1523, 2065, 2045, 2020, 2053, 8505, 1996, 27980, 2052, 10083, 1996, 2088, 1524, 1012, 2027, 2036, 2056, 2008, 2076, 1037, 8505, 19718, 1996, 27980, 2020, 2464, 2770, 2055, 1999, 1996, 3224, 2005, 3571, 2127, 2027, 2179, 1037, 8892, 3392, 1010, 2073, 2027, 2699, 2000, 19819, 3209, 1025, 2021, 1996, 3392, 2001, 2045, 6279, 2239, 2275, 2006, 2543, 2011, 1996, 7407, 2321, 2403, 3062, 2386, 1010, 1045, 1010, 5354, 2683, 1012, 1012, 1996, 2845, 3802, 7295, 8662, 25869, 17040, 2378, 1010, 2040, 1999, 1996, 2034, 2173, 3957, 2149, 2592, 2055, 1996, 4784, 1997, 1996, 2845, 5001, 4523, 1010, 4136, 2149, 2172, 1996, 2168, 2055, 2068, 2004, 3389, 2213, 1010, 1054, 21030, 2078, 1010, 27589, 15687, 1998, 3062, 2386, 2079, 2055, 2216, 1997, 1996, 17660, 1998, 6983, 5001, 4523, 1012, 1523, 8505, 2003, 1524, 1010, 2758, 25869, 17040, 2378, 1010, 1523, 2119, 1037, 2204, 1998, 1037, 2919, 2643, 1025, 2002, 2003, 2204, 2138, 2002, 2566, 3366, 26869, 2015, 1996, 4763, 16657, 1999, 3183, 1037, 2919, 2373, 2003, 14091, 1012, 1524, 9932, 6460, 3489, 2003, 15546, 2011, 1996, 5001, 4523, 1010, 2002, 4247, 1010, 2138, 1010, 2004, 2027, 14396, 1010, 2002, 2038, 1999, 2010, 2398, 2373, 2058, 1996, 2166, 1998, 2331, 1010, 1996, 2204, 1998, 5665, 2740, 1997, 2273, 1012, 2002, 7323, 2015, 1996, 4763, 8633, 2040, 2024, 5665, 1011, 21866, 2000, 1996, 5001, 4523, 1010, 5008, 2010, 12563, 2012, 2068, 2073, 2027, 2444, 1999, 1996, 5749, 1998, 4020, 1010, 2030, 1999, 1996, 11143, 1997, 1996, 6597, 1012, 1996, 5001, 4523, 2031, 28667, 22957, 2063, 2000, 2032, 2043, 2027, 2903, 2008, 16657, 2031, 2022, 9148, 28265, 2037, 29495, 28822, 1010, 1999, 2344, 2000, 7195, 3209, 1012, 9932, 6460, 3489, 7323, 2015, 1996, 4763, 1011, 18629, 2099, 1025, 2823, 2002, 4858, 1996, 10276, 1998, 2059, 2002, 8563, 2032, 1012, 9932, 6460, 3489, 23120, 2015, 1999, 1996, 2250, 1010, 2002, 14994, 1996, 14395, 26755, 1997, 2273, 2130, 2043, 1996, 5001, 4523, 2903, 2008, 2002, 102]}, {"score": 0.9676985144615173, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "As to spirits causing sickness, Samic mythology developed an idea of a personal demon of disease, called Rutu or Rota, who, however, was known only to the Scandinavian Lapps. Different theories have been presented as to the origin of the name rutu . Above all, Rutu seems especially to have been worshipped as a personification of epidemic diseases--etymologically rutu is akin to Finnish rutto , \u201cplague\u201d or \u201cpest\u201d --and the underworld, Rotaimo or Jabmeaimo, is mentioned as his proper abode, which is due to the fact that the Lapps localized diseases at the underworld. Later on Rotaimo or Jabmeaimo, developed under the influence of Christian ideas, into the hell of the Lapps, and Rota or Rutu himself became an evil, tormenting god, a devil. In spite of this the Lapps in some cases, when no help was to be expected from other gods, were wont to offer sacrifices to this devil, the sacrifice always consisting of a horse 82 81 Itkonen, Heidnische Religion , 71-115. . Not only the sacrificial animal but also the way of performing the sacrifice was peculiar. According to Sidenius the victim had to be buried in the earth in order that Rutu might ride away and down into the underworld on the horse. The Lapps have found, the same author adds, that Rota brings diseases and plagues both to men and reindeer, and if there has been no other remedy they have bribed him with sacrifices to get rid of him. 83 82 Reuterski\u00f6ld, K\u00e4llskrifter , 36 (Forbus), 59 (Sidenius). .", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2004, 2000, 8633, 4786, 15556, 1010, 17015, 2278, 11327, 2764, 2019, 2801, 1997, 1037, 3167, 5698, 1997, 4295, 1010, 2170, 21766, 8525, 2030, 18672, 2050, 1010, 2040, 1010, 2174, 1010, 2001, 2124, 2069, 2000, 1996, 17660, 5001, 4523, 1012, 2367, 8106, 2031, 2042, 3591, 2004, 2000, 1996, 4761, 1997, 1996, 2171, 21766, 8525, 1012, 2682, 2035, 1010, 21766, 8525, 3849, 2926, 2000, 2031, 2042, 22876, 2004, 1037, 2711, 9031, 1997, 16311, 7870, 1011, 1011, 3802, 24335, 10091, 2135, 21766, 8525, 2003, 17793, 2000, 6983, 21766, 9284, 1010, 1523, 11629, 1524, 2030, 1523, 20739, 1524, 1011, 1011, 1998, 1996, 13607, 1010, 18672, 4886, 5302, 2030, 14855, 25526, 5243, 16339, 1010, 2003, 3855, 2004, 2010, 5372, 11113, 10244, 1010, 2029, 2003, 2349, 2000, 1996, 2755, 2008, 1996, 5001, 4523, 22574, 7870, 2012, 1996, 13607, 1012, 2101, 2006, 18672, 4886, 5302, 2030, 14855, 25526, 5243, 16339, 1010, 2764, 2104, 1996, 3747, 1997, 3017, 4784, 1010, 2046, 1996, 3109, 1997, 1996, 5001, 4523, 1010, 1998, 18672, 2050, 2030, 21766, 8525, 2370, 2150, 2019, 4763, 1010, 21741, 2075, 2643, 1010, 1037, 6548, 1012, 1999, 8741, 1997, 2023, 1996, 5001, 4523, 1999, 2070, 3572, 1010, 2043, 2053, 2393, 2001, 2000, 2022, 3517, 2013, 2060, 5932, 1010, 2020, 2180, 2102, 2000, 3749, 18502, 2000, 2023, 6548, 1010, 1996, 8688, 2467, 5398, 1997, 1037, 3586, 6445, 6282, 2009, 19648, 2368, 1010, 2002, 3593, 8977, 5403, 4676, 1010, 6390, 1011, 10630, 1012, 1012, 2025, 2069, 1996, 17266, 3089, 8873, 13247, 4111, 2021, 2036, 1996, 2126, 1997, 4488, 1996, 8688, 2001, 14099, 1012, 2429, 2000, 2217, 20447, 1996, 6778, 2018, 2000, 2022, 3950, 1999, 1996, 3011, 1999, 2344, 2008, 21766, 8525, 2453, 4536, 2185, 1998, 2091, 2046, 1996, 13607, 2006, 1996, 3586, 1012, 1996, 5001, 4523, 2031, 2179, 1010, 1996, 2168, 3166, 9909, 1010, 2008, 18672, 2050, 7545, 7870, 1998, 11629, 2015, 2119, 2000, 2273, 1998, 29495, 1010, 1998, 2065, 2045, 2038, 2042, 2053, 2060, 19519, 2027, 2031, 26470, 2094, 2032, 2007, 18502, 2000, 2131, 9436, 1997, 2032, 1012, 6640, 6445, 26665, 3211, 11614, 1010, 10556, 12718, 21638, 10128, 3334, 1010, 4029, 1006, 2005, 8286, 1007, 1010, 5354, 1006, 2217, 20447, 1007, 1012, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9695892333984375, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "The primitive speculation relating to the noidendirri and practices connected with it, however, is only one side of the Samic theory of discase. Different illnesses of course are believed to have somewhat different causes according to their symptoms. The most common explanation given of illnesses, the cause of which appeared mysterious, among the Lapps was the same as among other Finno-Ugrian peoples: they were believed to be sent by their own relatives who wished to take the survivors with them to the realm of the dead. The departed in the Hades of the Lapps, and the female ruler over it, who in the more developed Norwegian mythology is called Jabmeakka, generally were anxious to make their surviving relatives follow them there, either as a punishment or merely because they were longing for their company. Now if someone fell ill with a serious malady, the Lapps presumed that the soul of the patient had gone alone to the abode of the dead, and if the soul could not quickly be released and brought back, the body also would soon follow it. What the noidi had to do in such a case was to make a journey to the under-world for the purpose of liberating the soul by placating the departed with conjurations, prayers, and offerings. It was during this dangerous journey that he, among other things, needed the help of the saivo-guelle , the mysterious fish or snake the mission of which it was to protect him and help him to reach his destination.

Most of the parts are divided equally among the eaters, but with regard to certain parts certain regulations are observed. Only a few of them are generally common throughout the whole Lappish area; their great number, however, proves that the custom itself is very old. Internal family relations play an important role in this custom. The master of the household reserves for himself the first vertebra, the tail, and the lower bone in one hind leg. With his wife he eats the tongue, lower jaw, eyes, kidneys, and rectum. The mistress gets the sacrum ( k adnis ) and the upper bone in one hind leg. The bones in the forelegs are given to the children (the boys eat the lower bones, the girls the upper bones). The parents and the children eat the fat front part of the back. The lower bone in the other hind leg belongs to the manservant, the upper bone to the maid. The servants get the sausage made in the large intestine, the back part of the back, the neck, liver, hoofs, muzzle, and ears. The children are urged to eat eyes of reindeer and pikes so that they may see better. \u201cWho eats the spleen, gets good reindeer\u201d (I. rein.).

Analyzing the custom, we can distinguish at least three factors in it, all of which are associated with magical ideas: first, the scarification or bleeding itself; second, the matter (soot, ashes) rubbed into the wounds; and third, the patterns and marks incised which remain when the wounds have healed. Bleeding and scarification are common practices of purely magical significance among all Indians of South America, and as far as the Pilcomayo tribes are concerned I shall have occasion to mention this custom again in a later chapter. The very scars left after such operations are regarded as a protection against evil spirits. Further, that tattooing is done by means of ashes or soot is certainly not an accident. The use of ashes for superstitious purposes is of frequent occurrence among the Indians, the general idea being that ashes are a prophylactic against evil spirits.

Rheumatic pains, especially during the dry season, are very common, and both young and old people suffer from them. As we know, they usually come on very suddenly, and even civilized peoples still use expressions like fairy-dart,  Hexenschuss , etc. of such sudden ailments. Beliefs of this kind are held both by the Choroti and by the other Chaco Indians. The Indians have very concrete ideas as to the way in which the sorcerers and the demons who serve them operate. The mysterious pain suddenly afflicting a man is explained as due to an arrow shot by an evil spirit. The Choroti accordingly call this disease-demon mohsek ihitek, i.e. the arrow-shooting demon, and this is an idea which is quite common among the South American Indians in general. The expression seems to indicate that at least in some cases an evil spirit is supposed to operate alone. As a rule, however, he is sent by a human sorcerer. I have already mentioned that the arrow or splinter, discharged by the sorcerer or his assistant demon, is generally a small stone, a cactus thorn, a piece of bone, or a small insect (for instance a worm or a beetle). I have also stated that this seemingly insignificant material object is identical with a mysterious demonical being whom the medicine-man, in curing the patient, tries to extract from his body. The object is sent by a mohsek, or in a certain sense is a mohsek . Generally, however, the Choroti call the mysterious intruder by another name: sometimes it is called nihl\u00e9le, in other cases again pin\u00ed, words which have their equivalents in the Mataco and the Toba languages in the terms al\u00e1h and kaip\u00e1k respectively.

The Indians showed with apparent satisfaction even those cicatrices which the palometa fishes had inflicted on their body with their sharp teeth when they were bathing in the river. It is clear that according to the idea of the Indians not only the bleeding purges the body from impure matter and strengthens the limbs, but that the very scars which remain after the operation possess some mysterious power to keep off evil influences, a power which is much the same as that ascribed to real tattooing marks. This Indian view is especially conspicuous in regard to an operation which the whites sometimes perform upon Indians who have come in contact with European civilization, namely, vaccination. I could myself appreciate the extraordinary importance ascribed to scars when during my stay at Esperanza I vaccinated a number of Chaco Indians who were employed as labourers at the sugar factory. The Christians probably have no remedy which the natives understand so well as this one, and they therefore as a rule submitted to the vaccine inoculation without remonstration, in fact, with pleasure. The small indelible marks which remained were regarded with wonder and admiration, and it was perfectly understood that they were a sort of warranty that the terrible disease would not attack the person wearing them.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 13521, 2187, 2011, 1996, 7659, 2024, 11121, 2007, 2729, 1998, 3491, 2007, 9967, 1010, 5262, 2007, 6620, 1012, 1996, 6505, 3662, 2007, 6835, 9967, 2130, 2216, 25022, 11266, 17599, 2015, 2029, 1996, 24326, 11368, 2050, 21995, 2018, 17303, 2006, 2037, 2303, 2007, 2037, 4629, 4091, 2043, 2027, 2020, 17573, 1999, 1996, 2314, 1012, 2009, 2003, 3154, 2008, 2429, 2000, 1996, 2801, 1997, 1996, 6505, 2025, 2069, 1996, 9524, 24694, 2015, 1996, 2303, 2013, 17727, 5397, 3043, 1998, 12919, 2015, 1996, 10726, 1010, 2021, 2008, 1996, 2200, 13521, 2029, 3961, 2044, 1996, 3169, 10295, 2070, 8075, 2373, 2000, 2562, 2125, 4763, 8092, 1010, 1037, 2373, 2029, 2003, 2172, 1996, 2168, 2004, 2008, 28025, 2000, 2613, 11660, 2075, 6017, 1012, 2023, 2796, 3193, 2003, 2926, 19194, 1999, 7634, 2000, 2019, 3169, 2029, 1996, 12461, 2823, 4685, 2588, 6505, 2040, 2031, 2272, 1999, 3967, 2007, 2647, 10585, 1010, 8419, 1010, 12436, 14693, 9323, 1012, 1045, 2071, 2870, 9120, 1996, 9313, 5197, 28025, 2000, 13521, 2043, 2076, 2026, 2994, 2012, 9686, 4842, 16076, 1045, 12436, 14693, 23854, 1037, 2193, 1997, 15775, 3597, 6505, 2040, 2020, 4846, 2004, 24043, 2012, 1996, 5699, 4713, 1012, 1996, 8135, 2763, 2031, 2053, 19519, 2029, 1996, 12493, 3305, 2061, 2092, 2004, 2023, 2028, 1010, 1998, 2027, 3568, 2004, 1037, 3627, 7864, 2000, 1996, 17404, 1999, 10085, 9513, 2302, 2128, 16563, 6494, 3508, 1010, 1999, 2755, 1010, 2007, 5165, 1012, 1996, 2235, 27427, 20806, 3468, 6017, 2029, 2815, 2020, 5240, 2007, 4687, 1998, 17005, 1010, 1998, 2009, 2001, 6669, 5319, 2008, 2027, 2020, 1037, 4066, 1997, 10943, 2100, 2008, 1996, 6659, 4295, 2052, 2025, 2886, 1996, 2711, 4147, 2068, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9637864232063293, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Among the Mataco, who in general are more addicted to religion and superstition than the Choroti, the character of facial painting as a magical charm is more conspicious.

Speaking of the dress of the Choroti, I mentioned the large and costly kind of necklace consisting of snail\u2019s shells elaborately fashioned into small round buttons with a hole drilled in the centre and closely strung together. The necklace, called l\u00e4hslehu\u00e9sle in the Choroti language, is not only an ornament but at the same time a magical charm. The Choroti no doubt gave me the true explanation of their original significance when they told me that the necklace is a protection against sickness. The evil spirits, according to the idea of these Indians, preferably attach themselves to the throat or the chest, because catarrhs are very common in the Chaco during the dry season. The spirits are believed to enter into the body through the throat or the breast, but this is prevented by the protecting necklace. Hence, when a Choroti Indian sells his necklace or leaves off wearing it, his comrades say that he will most certainly soon fall ill. The same idea I found prevailing among the Mataco-Noct\u00e9nes of Bolivia, where such ornaments are worn by both sexes. Thus the son of a chief, who was just at the age of puberty, one day appeared painted red in the face with uruc\u00fa, and with a large necklace which covered the neck and the breast. When I asked the father why his son had put on these things, he answered: It is in order that he may not fall ill. Both among the Mataco and the Choroti it is customary that children of both sexes go totally naked up to the age of eight to ten years, but nearly always they wear collars and facial paintings which most certainly are not ornaments in the civilized sense of the word.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 6505, 1997, 1996, 14255, 22499, 27871, 2080, 2224, 2536, 7957, 1997, 13016, 2015, 1010, 1998, 2009, 3849, 2000, 2022, 1996, 3627, 2008, 2426, 1996, 2087, 10968, 6946, 1010, 2107, 2004, 1996, 16480, 21709, 2072, 1998, 6683, 7393, 8485, 1010, 2027, 2024, 2062, 6247, 2011, 2273, 2084, 2011, 2308, 1010, 2426, 1996, 2062, 25825, 2000, 22083, 2153, 2062, 2011, 2308, 2084, 2011, 2273, 1012, 4092, 1997, 1996, 4377, 1997, 1996, 16480, 21709, 2072, 1010, 1045, 3855, 1996, 2312, 1998, 17047, 2785, 1997, 13016, 5398, 1997, 10879, 1521, 1055, 10986, 9603, 2135, 13405, 2046, 2235, 2461, 11287, 2007, 1037, 4920, 24311, 1999, 1996, 2803, 1998, 4876, 23509, 2362, 1012, 1996, 13016, 1010, 2170, 2474, 7898, 2571, 20169, 25016, 1999, 1996, 16480, 21709, 2072, 2653, 1010, 2003, 2025, 2069, 2019, 2030, 18442, 3372, 2021, 2012, 1996, 2168, 2051, 1037, 8687, 11084, 1012, 1996, 16480, 21709, 2072, 2053, 4797, 2435, 2033, 1996, 2995, 7526, 1997, 2037, 2434, 7784, 2043, 2027, 2409, 2033, 2008, 1996, 13016, 2003, 1037, 3860, 2114, 15556, 1012, 1996, 4763, 8633, 1010, 2429, 2000, 1996, 2801, 1997, 2122, 6505, 1010, 9544, 8231, 22476, 3209, 2000, 1996, 3759, 2030, 1996, 3108, 1010, 2138, 4937, 2906, 25032, 2015, 2024, 2200, 2691, 1999, 1996, 15775, 3597, 2076, 1996, 4318, 2161, 1012, 1996, 8633, 2024, 3373, 2000, 4607, 2046, 1996, 2303, 2083, 1996, 3759, 2030, 1996, 7388, 1010, 2021, 2023, 2003, 8729, 2011, 1996, 8650, 13016, 1012, 6516, 1010, 2043, 1037, 16480, 21709, 2072, 2796, 15187, 2010, 13016, 2030, 3727, 2125, 4147, 2009, 1010, 2010, 19033, 2360, 2008, 2002, 2097, 2087, 5121, 2574, 2991, 5665, 1012, 1996, 2168, 2801, 1045, 2179, 19283, 2426, 1996, 22640, 3597, 1011, 2053, 6593, 28553, 1997, 11645, 1010, 2073, 2107, 24005, 2024, 6247, 2011, 2119, 21024, 1012, 2947, 1996, 2365, 1997, 1037, 2708, 1010, 2040, 2001, 2074, 2012, 1996, 2287, 1997, 9047, 15010, 1010, 2028, 2154, 2596, 4993, 2417, 1999, 1996, 2227, 2007, 24471, 14194, 2226, 1010, 1998, 2007, 1037, 2312, 13016, 2029, 3139, 1996, 3300, 1998, 1996, 7388, 1012, 2043, 1045, 2356, 1996, 2269, 2339, 2010, 2365, 2018, 2404, 2006, 2122, 2477, 1010, 2002, 4660, 1024, 2009, 2003, 1999, 2344, 2008, 2002, 2089, 2025, 2991, 5665, 1012, 2119, 2426, 1996, 22640, 3597, 1998, 1996, 16480, 21709, 2072, 2009, 2003, 16120, 2008, 2336, 1997, 2119, 21024, 2175, 6135, 6248, 2039, 2000, 1996, 2287, 1997, 2809, 2000, 2702, 2086, 1010, 2021, 3053, 2467, 2027, 4929, 9127, 2015, 1998, 13268, 5265, 2029, 2087, 5121, 2024, 2025, 24005, 1999, 1996, 25825, 3168, 1997, 1996, 2773, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9664210081100464, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "\u201cSorcerers also are not lacking among them, these, of course, being the most cunning, and the most feared and respected members of the community, who also play the part of medicasters and priests.

In spite of this [199] smallpox wreaks havoc among them, mostly, I believe, because of not taking the proper precautions (which is impossible, their houses and clothing being what they are) rather than because of lack of domestic and personal cleanliness which, in so far as I have been able to observe, is quite adequate.

Unlike the hall, the grave is a place to which all manner of spirits, including kui (ghosts) who are not ancestors, have access. * Kui is a term used generally for all the souls of the dead. Ancestors, those dead to whom one is obligated as a kinsman, are usually referred to by a more polite term, commonly co-kong , but if pressed most informants will concede that co-kong are kui , albeit more approachable and better known than the kui of dead strangers. \u201cAt the hall only the ancestor comes to eat, though he might bring along a friend; it is like the feast that the living have after the offerings. But at the grave there might be flocks of ghosts around trying to eat the offerings we make to our ancestor.\u201d Accordingly, many of the activities at the grave are directed against any uninvited ghosts who might be on hand. To ensure that the ancestor receives the offerings made to him, for example, the smoldering ashes of the paper money burnt for him are doused with a cup of wine to \u201cmark\u201d this and all the rest of the offerings as his alone and to prevent other ghosts from taking them. The living who are present also need to be protected. The most common measure taken to this end is to pass out red steamed cakes to everyone who comes to the grave, the red color acting as a prophylactic to ward off any danger from lingering contact with ghosts. Another common precaution is to warn children against urinating anywhere near a grave. Everyone knew what had befallen one small boy who had urinated at a grave near Ch'inan. A ghost who happened to be at that spot had thereupon followed the boy home and had plagued him with illness until the child was exorcised of his tormentor by a god.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 2755, 2008, 1996, 2534, 2064, 2069, 2022, 4548, 2011, 2216, 2040, 2031, 1037, 2157, 2000, 2022, 2045, 1010, 8419, 1010, 10748, 1010, 2036, 7126, 2000, 4863, 1996, 4489, 1999, 2833, 14927, 2012, 1996, 2048, 4573, 1998, 1996, 3168, 1997, 12503, 2055, 1996, 13032, 1999, 1996, 6542, 1012, 4406, 1996, 2534, 1010, 1996, 6542, 2003, 1037, 2173, 2000, 2029, 2035, 5450, 1997, 8633, 1010, 2164, 13970, 2072, 1006, 11277, 1007, 2040, 2024, 2025, 10748, 1010, 2031, 3229, 1012, 1008, 13970, 2072, 2003, 1037, 2744, 2109, 3227, 2005, 2035, 1996, 9293, 1997, 1996, 2757, 1012, 10748, 1010, 2216, 2757, 2000, 3183, 2028, 2003, 27885, 14715, 3064, 2004, 1037, 12631, 11512, 1010, 2024, 2788, 3615, 2000, 2011, 1037, 2062, 13205, 2744, 1010, 4141, 2522, 1011, 4290, 1010, 2021, 2065, 4508, 2087, 28694, 2015, 2097, 9530, 22119, 2008, 2522, 1011, 4290, 2024, 13970, 2072, 1010, 12167, 2062, 3921, 3085, 1998, 2488, 2124, 2084, 1996, 13970, 2072, 1997, 2757, 12358, 1012, 1523, 2012, 1996, 2534, 2069, 1996, 13032, 3310, 2000, 4521, 1010, 2295, 2002, 2453, 3288, 2247, 1037, 2767, 1025, 2009, 2003, 2066, 1996, 9831, 2008, 1996, 2542, 2031, 2044, 1996, 14927, 1012, 2021, 2012, 1996, 6542, 2045, 2453, 2022, 19311, 2015, 1997, 11277, 2105, 2667, 2000, 4521, 1996, 14927, 2057, 2191, 2000, 2256, 13032, 1012, 1524, 11914, 1010, 2116, 1997, 1996, 3450, 2012, 1996, 6542, 2024, 2856, 2114, 2151, 4895, 2378, 25217, 2094, 11277, 2040, 2453, 2022, 2006, 2192, 1012, 2000, 5676, 2008, 1996, 13032, 8267, 1996, 14927, 2081, 2000, 2032, 1010, 2005, 2742, 1010, 1996, 15488, 11614, 7999, 11289, 1997, 1996, 3259, 2769, 11060, 2005, 2032, 2024, 2079, 13901, 2007, 1037, 2452, 1997, 4511, 2000, 1523, 2928, 1524, 2023, 1998, 2035, 1996, 2717, 1997, 1996, 14927, 2004, 2010, 2894, 1998, 2000, 4652, 2060, 11277, 2013, 2635, 2068, 1012, 1996, 2542, 2040, 2024, 2556, 2036, 2342, 2000, 2022, 5123, 1012, 1996, 2087, 2691, 5468, 2579, 2000, 2023, 2203, 2003, 2000, 3413, 2041, 2417, 21734, 22619, 2000, 3071, 2040, 3310, 2000, 1996, 6542, 1010, 1996, 2417, 3609, 3772, 2004, 1037, 17678, 29598, 28804, 2000, 4829, 2125, 2151, 5473, 2013, 15304, 3967, 2007, 11277, 1012, 2178, 2691, 3653, 3540, 13700, 2003, 2000, 11582, 2336, 2114, 24471, 19185, 5973, 2379, 1037, 6542, 1012, 3071, 2354, 2054, 2018, 2022, 13976, 2368, 2028, 2235, 2879, 2040, 2018, 24471, 15833, 2012, 1037, 6542, 2379, 10381, 1005, 27118, 2078, 1012, 1037, 5745, 2040, 3047, 2000, 2022, 2012, 2008, 3962, 2018, 2045, 6279, 2239, 2628, 1996, 2879, 2188, 1998, 2018, 17808, 2032, 2007, 7355, 2127, 1996, 2775, 2001, 4654, 2953, 18380, 2094, 1997, 2010, 21741, 2953, 2011, 1037, 2643, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.947027325630188, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "No matter how many precautions are taken to ensure the ancestor's happiness in the grave, they may still prove inadequate.

Six of them were prolonged sessions, some lasting over several days, and involved cases of serious or intractable illness. Two of these cases were diagnosed as instances of ancestral interference; one was held to be the work of an ancestor in the hall, the other the work of an ancestor in the grave.

Child caretakers also learn to indulge their charges to stop the noise and, as the case may be, keep out of trouble. The response to an older child's crying is often devoid of what we call nurturant behavior. In fact, nurturant comforting behavior is rarely seen in Taiwanese families except toward the very young. Older children learn not to ask for sympathy and to endure a variety of pains without displaying the emotions we usually recognize as requests for comforting, supportive behavior from their parents. A school-age child who falls and scrapes her knee knows better than to come and ask a parent for help. One mother told us: \u201cThey don't dare come crying to me. I always scold them and say, \u2018I called you to help me so why didn't you come instead of staying there and getting yourself hurt.\u2019 Or else I say, \u2018Why didn't you stay home? Why do you have to go outside and play and get hurt?\u2019 Really, sometimes they get bad scrapes, but they never tell me about it. They go and get some medicine and put it on themselves. Anyway, they are this old now [seven and nine years] so they shouldn't come crying to me.\u201d Displays of affection, except toward infants, are frowned on in Taiwanese society, and perhaps nurturant behavior is too similar in appearance to be socially acceptable. The traditional belief that a child's body belongs to her parents, and any injury to it an affront to them, produces what appears to be very callous behavior on the part of parents.

Have you finished yet?\u201d Cui-tho was supposed to be sweeping the yard in preparation for the police inspection. He got up right away and went back to his sweeping.

Before the coming of the Japanese, there were no plague-like diseases on Taiwan, but recently a number of people have died from this kind of diseases. This is the punishment of the god Kuan Kung. For this reason as Japanese become more numerous, the Taiwanese become fewer in number. There is a direct relationship in the number of deaths of Taiwanese and the number of Japanese on the island. This is because Kuan Kung hates the Japanese. This being the case, Taiwanese must not on any account fraternize with Japanese. This kind of ignorant nonsense of course has not one iota of value, but the stupid common people can be affected by such empty words and their hearts moved. Accordingly let us make a more thorough investigation of the manner in which the spirit writing cult was propagated. It is certain that the most frenzied activity was in Taichung province. From about April of 1902, the cult overran Miao-Li , Tung-Shih , Chang-Hwa Lu-Kang , Pei-T'ou , Pei-Kang , etc. By mid-June it had penetrated to the area of the north of Tainan, i.e. Chia-Yi . Officials earnestly discussed measures to stem the tide, but there was no easy way to do this. By the end of July the cult had reached as far as Ma-Tou (near Tainan). At this time the police office in Ma-Tou forbid the spirit writing cult to meet. By making the utmost efforts, the officials were able to dampen the movement a little. From then on the southern penetration of the cult began to slacken. It was not until August or September that the cult reached the southern end of the island. When it entered the Heng-Chun district, its fury was visibly less, and the bad effects comparatively lighter. But in the Pescadores, a strong impulse emanated from the Tainan area. Gaining the endorsement of several sympathizers, the cult was established in the temples of the fortress of MaKung. On the basis of its reputation for curing opium addicts, a great number of addicts assembled there and before the gods made a vow to quit the habit. Daily the number of pilgrims grew more numerous, but suppression was so effective that by the end of August 1902, the cult had practically ceased activity.

The god again directs the next order of business: the resealing of a fate. Every person has a unique identity, based on the year, month, day and hour of his birth. In the traditional system of calendrical calculation, each year of the sixty year cycle is ruled over by a different \u2018Lord of the Year\u2019 ( Tai-Sui ). An individual born in a certain year may \u2018clash\u2019 with ( Ch'ung ) the Lord of that year, and thus make it necessary to \u2018hide his fate\u2019 ( kham un ), to avoid any unpleasant fate which might be in store for him. In this particular case, a man's fate had been \u2018hidden\u2019 earlier in the year, but it was felt that some mistake had been made and that the measure had been ineffective. So the gods were being asked to \u2018hide\u2019 it again this evening. The \u2018fate\u2019 was in a small ceramic jar, represented by a few grains of rice and beans, a few small nails, a coin or two, and a piece of red paper with the year, month, day and hour of birth of the individual written on it. The jar was covered with a piece of red cloth over the mouth, tied down with 12 strands of black thread. Pasted across the top was a \u2018seal charm\u2019 ( hong-hu-a ) made of a strip of yellow paper with a \u2018charm\u2019 written on it. A bamboo incense holder was tied to the side of the jar. In this case, the fate was thought to have escaped from the jar, thus allowing the Lord of the Year to see it and to make trouble for the involved. As a result, the man had become ill. The god directed that the seal and the red cloth should be removed and the jar placed on the sand planchette. The god used the peach branch to write a lengthy charm over the open mouth of the jar. He directed that the red cloth be re-tied, and while this was being done, the god called for the \u2018red pen\u2019 ( Hung-Tsu-Pi ) helper immediately took a writing brush which had been dipped in red ink and attached it to the end of the stylus. The god called for strips of yellow paper about an inch wide and six inches long, to be placed on the sand tray. He then wrote out three charms on the yellow paper with the \u2018red pen\u2019.

In Hsin-chu itself, this event is regarded as a pho-to (exorcism) and focuses on the grave containing the bones of those Hakka slain in their efforts to support imperial troops against the forces of the rebel Lin Shuang-wen in 1786-88 (Michael Moser, personal communication). For example, when I asked why a raw pig and raw fowl were offered to Co Su Kong, who is known to be a vegetarian, I was often told that Co Su Kong accepts the raw meat, cooks it, and distributes it to the hungry ghosts. One man said that the raw fowl is for the hungry ghosts and that the Ti Kong is for the \u201cmountain spirits\u201d who are also the soldiers of Co Su Kong.

They are not quarrelling or losing money; they are not getting sick. When illness occurs, particularly if it is repeated, severe, lengthy, or strikes more than one member of the family, then the family has lost its harmony. Sometimes a person feels that his family has lost its harmony and comes to find out if his suspicions are justified and what he can do about it.

When somebody is sick, one gives him household remedies, or other medicines recommended by a traditional herbalist or a Western-style druggist. If recovery is not prompt, or if it is followed by relapse, a doctor is consulted, who administers Westernstyle medicine. 1 I insist on the term Western-style rather than simply Western because, although the commodities are themselves of Western invention and often Western manufacture, their application is somewhat different. Because many drugs are openly available in Taiwan which are sold only on prescription in the West, many Taiwanese readily use medicine more powerful than is usual in, say, the United States. Further, since instructions are normally not in Chinese or are not read (or both), there is a generally poor relation between drug and complaint. Doctors vary widely in licensing and quality, and rural people do not differentiate very precisely between a \u201cdoctor\u201d trained for two months in the 1930s and one with a degree from an American or Japanese medical school trained in the 1960s. In general, doctors are perceived as people who give shots, and a session with a doctor which does not involve getting a shot is thought by many to be wasted money.

In the cases with which I am familiar she strikes misfortune upon her natal family or the families of her married sisters. This usually takes the form of sickness of one or more family members. When the sickness is not cured by ordinary means, the family turns to divination and learns of the plight of the ghost through a s\u00e9ance.

I hope you will find the matter of interest. The story goes this way: Guo Ching has a son who lives in Taitung and who is already married. I have heard that this boy had struck up with a girl in Taitung who already had a husband, so her husband divorced her. Although the girl's husband had already divorced her, her husband's mother became very angry, and as a result fell sick and died. Before this old mother died, she was particularly angry with Guo Ching's boy because the latter had damaged their family. For this reason she used some superstitious method (the kind of [Taiwanese aboriginal] wizardry you photographed when you were in Taitung) to wound Guo Ching's son's wife. The objective was to cause his wife to become sick and die so that Guo Ching's son wouldn't have a wife. Not long afterward Guo Ching's son's wife took sick (a neurosis like the one Guo Tong-ming died of). Guo Ching's boy saw that his wife had already developed a neurosis and was terrified, so two weeks ago he sent his wife back to our village. After this woman got to our village, she upset the family every day, and struck people. So Guo Ching's family had three gods come down. Two [ t\u00e2ng-ki ] were from our village: Guo Tian-huah [Third Prince] and Guo Ching-shoei [the Great Saint], and one t\u00e2ng-ki from another village. I hear that these three gods used very peaceful means in taking care of this matter to implore the ghost who was bothering the woman's body to leave. Finally the three gods used impolite words and told the ghost who was bothering the woman's body that if she didn't leave, the three of them would be impolite to her. At length the ghost left, and the three gods [left and their t\u00e2ng-ki ] sat down to rest. After the three t\u00e2ng-ki had stopped, they had some refreshments, and when they had finished their refreshments the three left together to go home. But...they had only just arrived at the pond behind Guo Ching's house (for it was the road beside the village pond) when the ghost, who had been standing there waiting for them, struck the Third Prince's t\u00e2ng-ki, Guo Tian-huah. Tian-huah was knocked to the ground by her, but just as the ghost was about to strike the other two t\u00e2ng-ki their two gods possessed them, so they began to fight vigorously with the ghost. The two t\u00e2ng-ki fought very boisterously [ Rehnaw ], sometimes chasing into the trees, sometimes onto a roof, sometimes chasing her through the fishpond.

I found her, as do many of her neighbors, an excellent informant on ancient home remedies, rituals for placating household gods and ghosts, techniques for protecting pregnant women, and for purifying rooms following childbirth. Part of her conflict with her late husband's younger brother, Lim Chieng-cua, results from his introduction of more economical practices in the ceremonies honoring the ancestors. Many families on Taiwan now combine the ceremonies celebrating their more distant ancestors' birth and death days, presenting the expensive offerings of meat and fowl to them all on the same day, rather than repeating the expense for each on their specific anniversary. Besides this, Lim Chieng-cua also abolished the bi-monthly offerings to Tu Ti Kung--a less expensive ceremony but one that has not been celebrated in many households for decades. A-pou bitterly resented these omissions and continued to offer an apologetic bit of incense each night and morning to preserve what to her was at least a semblance of propriety. When Lim Chieng-cua installed the new pump in the house without consulting the almanac, A-pou was angry for days. According to the almanac, the Placenta God was resting in that particular room on that particular day. Through Lim Chieng-cua's negligence, the little god was disturbed or injured, and he took his vengeance on A-pou's grandson in the form of a high fever.

Some of these causes I have already mentioned: royal spirits, sorcerers, the ancestors. But many diseases are almost personified by the Lozi and are commonly divined: liyala, maimbwe, mabamba, sisongo, muba , and others. Some of these diseases are more clearly associated with demons; thus muba is related to mwendandjangula and mwenda-lutaka , demons of the bush and the Plain respectively, which have half of human bodies and are fiery red. They are of both sexes. Should one of these spirits desire a man or woman, it will try to kidnap him or her, and can at least strike with severe illness. In all these diseases the treatment aims to produce, by smoking, drumming, and singing, hysteric symptoms: violent jerkings of the body in a state of seeming trance.

He or she may cause good or ill fortune to befall the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, \u201cwho are known to it,\u201d but his power is not limited by distance, since any royal grave can afflict any member of the royal line anywhere, cause misfortune to the whole of Loziland, or trouble any Lozi, even in White country, if it knows of him and his ancestors, especially if he is a member of the political sector attached to the royal grave. Each grave has its resident priests, appointed by the king in council. The priests make national offerings at the king's orders, and the cult is under his control. Individuals make offerings through the priests and if a spirit has been particularly troublesome the king himself may make offerings to it, through the mediation of the priests. According to Holub 4 Holub, 1881. and Louis Jalla. 5 Jalla, Louis, 1928. royal ancestors are regarded as intermediaries between Nyambe and the living. The relation between the Nyambe cult and the cult of the royal ancestors is by no means clear. The royal ancestors are sometimes entreated to intercede with Nyambe to restore someone to health and sometimes they are themselves regarded as the cause of disease.

Simply to look at the lists and prescriptions is to gain two impressions. Firstly, they would not have been recoverably in this form if much of it had not worked; secondly, with no notion of dosage, the risk of failure even if the active principle was right was thereby increased. 71 I own this point to Dr A. de Vente. I own this point to Dr A. de Vente. But here, as in those cases for which the prescription was wrong, there was a sequential series of blocks to falsifiability: if the specific treatment failed, this would be a sign that the affliction was not simple and it therefore required specialist treatment. If the healer's specifics failed, this was a sign of evil interference which had to be identified by divination, and in this way a structural block could be invoked, even if the patient died. Thus a difficult case would move along one axis of the table from individual to communal and the other from symptomatic to non-symptomatic treatment, hence diagonally. The line could be extended off the table since for affliction beyond the norm, such as the early 1890s smallpox epidemic, recourse could only be through appeal to the unseen powers and there divinatory practice merged with the other functions of the royal graves.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1045, 2079, 2025, 2031, 2592, 2013, 4106, 1997, 1996, 3161, 6481, 1998, 5144, 2556, 1999, 1996, 13441, 16250, 2005, 3563, 8030, 2348, 1045, 2031, 7201, 1997, 2107, 20422, 2015, 2005, 20934, 4135, 5831, 1998, 2045, 2024, 2405, 7201, 2005, 2048, 9632, 2752, 6631, 10468, 1996, 2168, 13194, 4219, 2004, 20934, 4135, 5831, 1012, 3963, 2492, 3964, 3355, 1025, 1037, 18485, 5796, 3074, 1010, 12800, 4437, 1010, 1999, 2026, 6664, 1025, 2005, 10556, 9626, 1010, 3964, 2011, 25353, 16563, 1999, 1051, 1012, 5435, 2229, 1011, 14412, 12830, 1010, 1996, 3628, 1997, 2430, 3088, 1006, 13817, 1010, 3838, 1007, 1025, 2005, 28352, 7103, 2571, 1010, 1058, 1012, 13097, 8449, 1010, 2070, 3060, 9947, 4264, 1998, 20233, 1997, 2642, 20340, 1010, 10588, 1011, 27656, 8138, 3259, 2340, 1006, 5087, 1010, 3982, 1007, 1025, 4949, 1999, 1043, 1012, 1043, 1012, 8132, 9091, 1998, 1046, 1012, 1050, 1012, 8416, 3771, 1010, 1996, 13622, 1010, 10072, 1998, 4910, 3001, 1997, 2167, 2530, 20340, 1006, 11320, 29289, 1010, 4347, 1007, 1025, 2530, 15633, 2003, 6817, 2011, 11655, 11714, 13473, 10440, 1011, 11163, 5677, 22153, 2050, 19268, 1012, 2492, 3964, 3355, 1025, 1037, 18485, 5796, 3074, 1010, 12800, 4437, 1010, 1999, 2026, 6664, 1025, 2005, 10556, 9626, 1010, 3964, 2011, 25353, 16563, 1999, 1051, 1012, 5435, 2229, 1011, 14412, 12830, 1010, 1996, 3628, 1997, 2430, 3088, 1006, 13817, 1010, 3838, 1007, 1025, 2005, 28352, 7103, 2571, 1010, 1058, 1012, 13097, 8449, 1010, 2070, 3060, 9947, 4264, 1998, 20233, 1997, 2642, 20340, 1010, 10588, 1011, 27656, 8138, 3259, 2340, 1006, 5087, 1010, 3982, 1007, 1025, 4949, 1999, 1043, 1012, 1043, 1012, 8132, 9091, 1998, 1046, 1012, 1050, 1012, 8416, 3771, 1010, 1996, 13622, 1010, 10072, 1998, 4910, 3001, 1997, 2167, 2530, 20340, 1006, 11320, 29289, 1010, 4347, 1007, 1025, 2530, 15633, 2003, 6817, 2011, 11655, 11714, 13473, 10440, 1011, 11163, 5677, 22153, 2050, 19268, 1012, 3432, 2000, 2298, 2012, 1996, 7201, 1998, 20422, 2015, 2003, 2000, 5114, 2048, 19221, 1012, 15847, 1010, 2027, 2052, 2025, 2031, 2042, 8980, 8231, 1999, 2023, 2433, 2065, 2172, 1997, 2009, 2018, 2025, 2499, 1025, 16378, 1010, 2007, 2053, 9366, 1997, 9998, 4270, 1010, 1996, 3891, 1997, 4945, 2130, 2065, 1996, 3161, 6958, 2001, 2157, 2001, 8558, 3445, 1012, 6390, 1045, 2219, 2023, 2391, 2000, 2852, 1037, 1012, 2139, 18834, 2063, 1012, 1045, 2219, 2023, 2391, 2000, 2852, 1037, 1012, 2139, 18834, 2063, 1012, 2021, 2182, 1010, 2004, 1999, 2216, 3572, 2005, 2029, 1996, 20422, 2001, 3308, 1010, 2045, 2001, 1037, 25582, 2186, 1997, 5991, 2000, 6904, 4877, 10128, 2401, 8553, 1024, 2065, 1996, 3563, 3949, 3478, 1010, 2023, 2052, 2022, 1037, 3696, 2008, 1996, 21358, 29301, 3258, 2001, 2025, 3722, 1998, 2009, 3568, 3223, 8325, 3949, 1012, 2065, 1996, 19783, 1005, 1055, 3563, 2015, 3478, 1010, 2023, 2001, 1037, 3696, 1997, 4763, 11099, 2029, 2018, 2000, 2022, 4453, 2011, 4487, 17948, 3508, 1010, 1998, 1999, 2023, 2126, 1037, 8332, 3796, 2071, 2022, 24959, 1010, 2130, 2065, 1996, 5776, 2351, 1012, 2947, 1037, 3697, 2553, 2052, 2693, 2247, 2028, 8123, 1997, 1996, 2795, 2013, 3265, 2000, 15029, 1998, 1996, 2060, 2013, 25353, 27718, 9626, 102]}, {"score": 0.9690631628036499, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Muba or Mwendanjangula or Mwendalutaka, as he is also called, was and is a monster who inhabited the deep forest.

He sang like a bird and his victims were drawn irresistibly to the sound. Once he appeared before them, they were lost, for like his human brothers the baloi (witches), Mwendanjangula enslaved their spirits.

According to the shamans, both of them once were human beings, but were changed into demons on account of their sins. They deprive men of their intelligence. They are offered a mare of spotted color ( cugur ). 3) Dzachtan-byradaj, or Jurjun-ogustach once was a shaman and possessed a white bull. The bull was stolen so the shaman became malicious. After his death he was punished by becoming a demon. He causes diseases, especially chest ailments in young children with fatal exit, unless he be offered a three years old calf. 4) Sordach-conach was a female shaman when she was alive. She causes several epidemics. According to the shamans her appearance is ugly, she has but one hand and foot, and one eye in the middle of the forehead. She is offered a red-stained cow ( k\u00e9chebiren ). 5) Makyny-kysa-tynyrachtach-kjadzjaj, a former shaman woman, causes madness and other diseases.

It is venerated that much especially because the slightest touch may cause the ire of the Fury. 6) Buchar-dodar is the demon of death.

She lives in the nether world where like him, and with the exceptions of a few minor ones, there are eight demons of equal rank. 7) Syry-kysa is a woman shaman as to her origin. She seduces people to do wrong, to suffer evil. She is not offered anything. The shaman has no difficulty in exorcizing her. 8) Sjulljukjuter are the demons of the waters.

Cachexia and scrofula are common also, particularly in poor localities which are subject to frequent famines. In damp and marshy places, among lakes, where the population feeds primarily on the poorest kinds of fish, leprosy is found, although by no means to such an extent as has been proclaimed. The point is that the inhabitants confuse this disea se with some forms of chronic syphilis, which manifests itself in this severe climate with fearsome severity: the body and the bones rot away, and the sick man decomposes while he is still alive, just as he does from leprosy. The inhabitants have a great fear of both these disease and, as soon as they develop, banish the sick one mercilessly: they put the syphilitics into the okrug hospitals, and drive those suspected of leprosy into the woods, where they have houses built for them and where they bring the m food at definite intervals. When such a colony dies off, the Yakut burn down the buildings with everything that is inside them. 1 Their fear of infection reaches such apoint that they avoid speaking to the sick or approaching them, even at a distance of several sagenes. They consider that the fish of a lake where lepers have fished are also leprous, and once when I gathered some cloudberries growing not far from the ashes of a colony of lepers, long since destroyed, the Yakut, learning of this, considered that I was a doomed man (Kolymsk Ulus, Engzha, 1883). Another time, when on the road to Kolymsk on the Indigirka I and my Cossack fellow-traveler, lagging behind the caravan, got lost in a snowstorm and accidentally stumbled on such a house, my young fellow-traveler, learning that lepers lived there, jumped up like a madman and ran, literally at a gallop, far beyond the confines of the enclosure, without waiting for me or asking the direction. The lepers themselves, who met us very timidly, went out into the yard and shouted dierctions to us from afar. They call leprosy the big sickness (ulakhan olyu, and also syster), and call syphilis the Russian or French disease. The worst of the epidemic diseases for the Yakut is smallpox.

From the reports of medical acquaintances and my own observations, the following diseases are known to me: catarrhal, gastric, and rheumatic fevers, pneumonia, diseases o the heart, liver, and gall bladder, consumption, cancer of the throat, uterus, and stomach, and diseases of the eye... Slight inflammations of the eye are cured very successfully by licking the pus from under the eyelid with the tip of the tongue. Sometimes this is done by particular specialists who have a particularly soft and thin tongue. People come purposely to the houses of such people and pay as much as thirty kopecks for an operation. Despite the abundance of water, swamp fever is comparatively rare; sufferers are cured by frightening them, or pouring cold water over them; even oftener they are not treated at all. Fever belongs to that class of diseases against which shamanism acknowledges itself to be powerless. Rheumatism is extremely widespread; finally, the terrible disease, contraction of the throat, is not a rarity; its victims die a death from hunger. This malady is apparently found most often in those places where cattle raising is the exclusive occupation, where the supply of wild animals has been exhausted and they do not raise grain; I think it appears as a result of eating liquid foods exclusively.

Mare's meat is more highly valued by the Yakut, it cost more, and is inaccessible to the poor. Even average households are not able to feast themselves on it very often. Less of it is used in general. - This is the food of rich men and horse thieves, says, not without foundation, a proverb. But on rare occasions even the poor manage to get hold of this meat, in the form of payment for work done, for hay, and so forth. In some localities the rich are very willing to settle accounts with slaughtered mares or two year old colts. Again, at weddings, even when the parties are not rich, the Yakut always slaughter horses and all the meat is eaten on the spot or taken home by the guests. The Yakut distinguish nine stages of corpulence in their horses and three stages of emaciation. They consider meat from a horse in the last stage of emaciation, yrbyt, injurious to the health. Matiushkin, who traveled with Vrangel, describes how when after many days of hungry wandering he offered to kill one of the horses, the Yakut, although famished and driven to desperation, refused: No, our horses are exhausted, covered with boils and wounds; their blood is inflamed and we will become ill if we start to eat their meat, - they replied. 1 Vrangel'. Vol. II, p. 267. I have myself heard these arguments more than once. Nevertheless in the Kolymsk Okrug in 1882, when great numbers of dead horses died along the road because of bad fodder, I saw whole caravans, of up to ten narts, of disgusting looking carrion with ragged skin and no meat at all. These dead horses were being carried to post stations, from where they were sold at a cheap price to poor Yakut. In general the Yakut do not scorn eating carrion and even rich men, using the pretext of opoy , uruttabyt , will not miss a chance to eat a dead mare or a cow, as long as it is fat. Opoy (heart failure) for some reason is not considered a dishonorable death. The Yakut are also willing to eat cattle which has died from malignant anthrax; they have even worked out a whole system of treating such horses. The sick horses are killed, which is something the Yakut always try to do with any hopelessly sick cattle; in no case, however, do they use the blood as food. Then the meat is quartered and hung up, to let it cool off and dry from any remnants of blood. Before eating it they boil it thoroughly, contrary to their usual practice with meat. The intestines and the fat are not eaten. They dress the cattle while wearing mittens and do all sorts of things so as not to get the disease themselves; nevertheless each year in the Yakutsk Oblast several families die from malignant anthrax. Often they fail to recognize this disease, and tempted by the sight of the fat meat attribute the cattle's death to the all-excusing heart failure", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 23768, 1999, 1996, 2126, 1997, 6240, 1996, 2034, 2173, 2426, 1996, 8038, 5283, 2102, 2429, 2000, 1996, 2193, 1997, 13433, 20620, 10202, 2003, 4548, 2012, 1996, 2556, 2051, 2011, 12486, 1012, 11941, 1005, 1055, 6240, 2003, 2062, 3811, 11126, 2011, 1996, 8038, 5283, 2102, 1010, 2009, 3465, 2062, 1010, 1998, 2003, 29104, 2000, 1996, 3532, 1012, 2130, 2779, 3911, 2024, 2025, 2583, 2000, 9831, 3209, 2006, 2009, 2200, 2411, 1012, 2625, 1997, 2009, 2003, 2109, 1999, 2236, 1012, 1011, 2023, 2003, 1996, 2833, 1997, 4138, 2273, 1998, 3586, 15862, 1010, 2758, 1010, 2025, 2302, 3192, 1010, 1037, 6011, 15185, 1012, 2021, 2006, 4678, 6642, 2130, 1996, 3532, 6133, 2000, 2131, 2907, 1997, 2023, 6240, 1010, 1999, 1996, 2433, 1997, 7909, 2005, 2147, 2589, 1010, 2005, 10974, 1010, 1998, 2061, 5743, 1012, 1999, 2070, 19664, 1996, 4138, 2024, 2200, 5627, 2000, 7392, 6115, 2007, 23044, 11941, 2015, 2030, 2048, 2095, 2214, 14390, 1012, 2153, 1010, 2012, 20429, 1010, 2130, 2043, 1996, 4243, 2024, 2025, 4138, 1010, 1996, 8038, 5283, 2102, 2467, 14574, 5194, 1998, 2035, 1996, 6240, 2003, 8828, 2006, 1996, 3962, 2030, 2579, 2188, 2011, 1996, 6368, 1012, 1996, 8038, 5283, 2102, 10782, 3157, 5711, 1997, 13058, 9307, 5897, 1999, 2037, 5194, 1998, 2093, 5711, 1997, 7861, 6305, 18963, 1012, 2027, 5136, 6240, 2013, 1037, 3586, 1999, 1996, 2197, 2754, 1997, 7861, 6305, 18963, 1010, 1061, 15185, 22123, 1010, 1999, 9103, 9488, 2271, 2000, 1996, 2740, 1012, 13523, 4173, 2232, 4939, 1010, 2040, 6158, 2007, 27830, 22043, 2140, 1010, 5577, 2129, 2043, 2044, 2116, 2420, 1997, 7501, 13071, 2002, 3253, 2000, 3102, 2028, 1997, 1996, 5194, 1010, 1996, 8038, 5283, 2102, 1010, 2348, 6904, 15630, 9072, 1998, 5533, 2000, 15561, 1010, 4188, 1024, 2053, 1010, 2256, 5194, 2024, 9069, 1010, 3139, 2007, 26077, 2015, 1998, 8710, 1025, 2037, 2668, 2003, 1999, 10258, 14074, 2094, 1998, 2057, 2097, 2468, 5665, 2065, 2057, 2707, 2000, 4521, 2037, 6240, 1010, 1011, 2027, 3880, 1012, 1015, 27830, 22043, 2140, 1005, 1012, 5285, 1012, 2462, 1010, 1052, 1012, 25491, 1012, 1045, 2031, 2870, 2657, 2122, 9918, 2062, 2084, 2320, 1012, 6600, 1999, 1996, 12849, 2135, 5244, 2243, 7929, 26549, 1999, 7131, 1010, 2043, 2307, 3616, 1997, 2757, 5194, 2351, 2247, 1996, 2346, 2138, 1997, 2919, 1042, 7716, 4063, 1010, 1045, 2387, 2878, 17184, 2015, 1010, 1997, 2039, 2000, 2702, 6583, 21217, 1010, 1997, 19424, 2559, 12385, 3258, 2007, 14202, 3096, 1998, 2053, 6240, 2012, 2035, 1012, 2122, 2757, 5194, 2020, 2108, 3344, 2000, 2695, 3703, 1010, 2013, 2073, 2027, 2020, 2853, 2012, 1037, 10036, 3976, 2000, 3532, 8038, 5283, 2102, 1012, 1999, 2236, 1996, 8038, 5283, 2102, 2079, 2025, 8040, 9691, 5983, 12385, 3258, 1998, 2130, 4138, 2273, 1010, 2478, 1996, 3653, 18209, 1997, 6728, 6977, 1010, 24471, 4904, 2696, 3762, 2102, 1010, 2097, 2025, 3335, 1037, 3382, 2000, 4521, 1037, 2757, 11941, 2030, 1037, 11190, 1010, 2004, 2146, 2004, 2009, 2003, 6638, 1012, 6728, 6977, 1006, 2540, 4945, 1007, 2005, 2070, 3114, 2003, 2025, 2641, 1037, 9841, 17175, 16670, 2331, 1012, 1996, 8038, 5283, 2102, 2024, 2036, 5627, 2000, 4521, 7125, 2029, 2038, 2351, 102]}, {"score": 0.9674615859985352, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "The souls of shamans, male and female, the souls of witches and wizards, abtakh, the souls of evil, envious, and angry people, or of all those set off from the rest in one way or another, all become er.

In Verkhoyansk I saw an old man who suffered from shifting rheumatism; his body was literally eaten out with deep burns. He treated his illness in the following fashion: as soon as pain or swelling would appear he would immediately put a piece of lighted tinder or rag on the affected spot, and then wait patiently for the whole piece to burn. A choking smell of burning cloth and human flesh would permeate the hut, and the old man would sit, his head downcast, and merely moan quietly and pitifully from time to time.

He had many children, seven, I believe, and one white bull on which his children rode when visiting neighbors, itimni. It happened that someone stole his bull and thus made it impossible for him to move about with his children. The children began to get sick and cry from hunger, and drove the old man to such a point that he dug a pit, put the children in it, and lit a fire over them. When the children began to choke and die he struck his tambourine and, walking around the fire, began to perform a shamanistic rite and utter his grieviances against mankind. In return for the injury he had suffered Ulu-toen gave him the right to take away a child for every hair on the bull. Since this time the old man, turned into an er , has gone about crippling and killing children.

To their titles is always added the clan name, which again indicates the tie between the Yakut cult of shamanism and their clan organization and their clan history. 2 In the Zapadno Kangalas Ulus I was even shown a tiny circular island in the middle of a small lake, on which the yurt of Dampay-Braday had once supposedly stood; this was not in the Bologur Nasleg, but in the Oktemsk Nasleg.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 5764, 2549, 1999, 1996, 2167, 1010, 2104, 1996, 3011, 1010, 2036, 3268, 1996, 2214, 2158, 10620, 4710, 1011, 8226, 4710, 2007, 2010, 2317, 7087, 1010, 9805, 2854, 5575, 13958, 19966, 27573, 13958, 10698, 2953, 1010, 10620, 4710, 1011, 8226, 4710, 13958, 10698, 2953, 1010, 2320, 1037, 8038, 5283, 2102, 23610, 1997, 1996, 8945, 21197, 3126, 5917, 1010, 1015, 1997, 1996, 8945, 21197, 3126, 17235, 23115, 1997, 1996, 7151, 20089, 6711, 17359, 2271, 1012, 2029, 2973, 1999, 1996, 2167, 1025, 2023, 2214, 2158, 2001, 2214, 1998, 3532, 1010, 1998, 2973, 2011, 12858, 1012, 2002, 2018, 2116, 2336, 1010, 2698, 1010, 1045, 2903, 1010, 1998, 2028, 2317, 7087, 2006, 2029, 2010, 2336, 8469, 2043, 5873, 10638, 1010, 2009, 5714, 3490, 1012, 2009, 3047, 2008, 2619, 10312, 2010, 7087, 1998, 2947, 2081, 2009, 5263, 2005, 2032, 2000, 2693, 2055, 2007, 2010, 2336, 1012, 1996, 2336, 2211, 2000, 2131, 5305, 1998, 5390, 2013, 9012, 1010, 1998, 5225, 1996, 2214, 2158, 2000, 2107, 1037, 2391, 2008, 2002, 8655, 1037, 6770, 1010, 2404, 1996, 2336, 1999, 2009, 1010, 1998, 5507, 1037, 2543, 2058, 2068, 1012, 2043, 1996, 2336, 2211, 2000, 16769, 1998, 3280, 2002, 4930, 2010, 17214, 25127, 3170, 1998, 1010, 3788, 2105, 1996, 2543, 1010, 2211, 2000, 4685, 1037, 23610, 6553, 14034, 1998, 14395, 2010, 24665, 2666, 18073, 9623, 2114, 14938, 1012, 1999, 2709, 2005, 1996, 4544, 2002, 2018, 4265, 17359, 2226, 1011, 11756, 2078, 2435, 2032, 1996, 2157, 2000, 2202, 2185, 1037, 2775, 2005, 2296, 2606, 2006, 1996, 7087, 1012, 2144, 2023, 2051, 1996, 2214, 2158, 1010, 2357, 2046, 2019, 9413, 1010, 2038, 2908, 2055, 13675, 11514, 14353, 1998, 4288, 2336, 1012, 2025, 1037, 2309, 23610, 2071, 9462, 2032, 1010, 2021, 2085, 2002, 2038, 2363, 1996, 2440, 20563, 1997, 2336, 2035, 27428, 2000, 2032, 1998, 2038, 2468, 19741, 1010, 2004, 1037, 2765, 1997, 2010, 2214, 2287, 1998, 1999, 27972, 3012, 1012, 2043, 2002, 2085, 7879, 2619, 2002, 2003, 2025, 2445, 2054, 2002, 5176, 2005, 1010, 2021, 3432, 2579, 2011, 1996, 3300, 1998, 6908, 2041, 1012, 1006, 15125, 6711, 17359, 2271, 1010, 6837, 1007, 1012, 2009, 2003, 8281, 1997, 1996, 8038, 5283, 2102, 23610, 6553, 24152, 2008, 2005, 1996, 2087, 2112, 1996, 3905, 8633, 2024, 2280, 23610, 2015, 2030, 2111, 2040, 2018, 5064, 2042, 5229, 1010, 2030, 1999, 2236, 4265, 1010, 2096, 2006, 2023, 3011, 1012, 2000, 2037, 4486, 2003, 2467, 2794, 1996, 6338, 2171, 1010, 2029, 2153, 7127, 1996, 5495, 2090, 1996, 8038, 5283, 2102, 8754, 1997, 23610, 2964, 1998, 2037, 6338, 3029, 1998, 2037, 6338, 2381, 1012, 1016, 1999, 1996, 23564, 15455, 3630, 16073, 7911, 2015, 17359, 2271, 1045, 2001, 2130, 3491, 1037, 4714, 8206, 2479, 1999, 1996, 2690, 1997, 1037, 2235, 2697, 1010, 2006, 2029, 1996, 9805, 5339, 1997, 10620, 4710, 1011, 8226, 4710, 2018, 2320, 10743, 2768, 1025, 2023, 2001, 2025, 1999, 1996, 8945, 21197, 3126, 17235, 23115, 1010, 2021, 1999, 1996, 7929, 18532, 6711, 17235, 23115, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9676170349121094, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "The Yakuts who live in the northern part of the Yakutsk government divide the diseases a man can have into two categories: such diseases which one may catch by chance and which soon are over, e. g. cuts sprains, &c, the healing of which is easily reached either by application of cow\u2019s butter, excrements, herbs, &c, or by setting the limbs; other diseases of inner organs, chronical ailments, nervous illness or mental troubles are considered to be due to a demon or spirit.

The Yakut consider a devil to be the cause of everything, for instance: if a person or head of cattle falls ill, or calves die, they day that a devil is torturing and killing them, without any understanding of the fact that all this has natural causes; healing through shamanism, which includes shouting over sore eyes, spitting on the sick part of the body, which is done not by a shaman but by ordinary Yakut and which sometimes succeeds, comes from sympathetic actions; 2) to repel cattle infection and especially the death of calves; 3) for entertainment, for in such cases the shamans do tricks and make prophesies; 4) for the delirious; because of great faith in shamanism, this illness formerly existed everywhere among the Yakut, especially among females, who can be stopped only by means of shamanism and otherwise continue to suffer. This custom, i.e., shamanism, has gradually almost died out since the Yakut adopted the Christian faith, and now most of the Yakut, enlightened by faith and the knowledge of the truth, recognize it as ignorance and superstition; however, many even of the converted Yakut, having bee brought up in the belief, practise it, but the Yakut do not consider this reprehensible, owing to the antiquity of the custom, and therefore no 219 strict measures are taken in this connection, the more so since: 1) the Yakut who practise shamanism do not forget that God exists and know that everything is done through His Almighty Power, for they have long become accustomed to saying, when a person dies, \u201cHe has gone to God\u201d, without distinguishing whether the person was righteous or sinful; circumstances which favor them have God's help, and likewise events which hinder them and accidents are recognized as God's punishment for sins; 2) if shamans were given strict punishment, then it would be necessary to punish their spectators as well, for they induced them to shamanize and came mainly to eat the sacrificed livestock; there are four or five people every time, from which it follows that very few would go unpunished, investigations and denunciations would multiply so that there would be no business but cases about shamanism, with resultant neglect to useful domestic occupations. The Yakut are using the following means to destroy this custom gradually: a) all converted Yakut are strictly forbidden by the clan-chiefs to shamanize and to have shamanism performed. In case of conviction of this offence, the guilty shaman is deprived of the clothing and objects which he uses for shamanism, they are destroyed, and the shaman's hair is shaved off, as a sign of his calling; and those who caused him to perform are given reprimands in meetings of the communities; b) among the unconverted, a shaman who was supposed to heal a patient but who did not succeed must turn over the head of cattle which was sacrificed and pay all losses incurred by the patient; but if he is convicted of this several times, he is declared an impostor and becomes a permanent object of mockery and is quite without employment. As this custom is repugnant to the Christian religion, 220 the Yakut themselves, and frequently the eparchial priests have sent denunciations to the authorities because of particular complaints among the Yakut, there have been investigations by the zemstvo officials, and the guilty parties have given themselves up to the disposition of the discretionary court which caused the Yakut, and especially those who were affected by the action, much losses and distractions from their occupations.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 23610, 2964, 2003, 2025, 1996, 4752, 2030, 4676, 1997, 1996, 8038, 5283, 2102, 2021, 1037, 3327, 2895, 3344, 2006, 1999, 3056, 4225, 6214, 2004, 4076, 1024, 1015, 1007, 2005, 2035, 7957, 1997, 5305, 2111, 1010, 2007, 2019, 4812, 2034, 2000, 5646, 2054, 6548, 2550, 1996, 4295, 1998, 2059, 4372, 7913, 4017, 2100, 2000, 2008, 6548, 2000, 8116, 1996, 5776, 2013, 1996, 7355, 1010, 2007, 1037, 17266, 3089, 8873, 13247, 5378, 1997, 1037, 2132, 1997, 7125, 1010, 1037, 3899, 1010, 2030, 2242, 1025, 5262, 1010, 2083, 2307, 4752, 1999, 2023, 1010, 5022, 2823, 6855, 4335, 1012, 1996, 8038, 5283, 2102, 5136, 1037, 6548, 2000, 2022, 1996, 3426, 1997, 2673, 1010, 2005, 6013, 1024, 2065, 1037, 2711, 2030, 2132, 1997, 7125, 4212, 5665, 1010, 2030, 28023, 3280, 1010, 2027, 2154, 2008, 1037, 6548, 2003, 17153, 16037, 1998, 4288, 2068, 1010, 2302, 2151, 4824, 1997, 1996, 2755, 2008, 2035, 2023, 2038, 3019, 5320, 1025, 8907, 2083, 23610, 2964, 1010, 2029, 2950, 11273, 2058, 14699, 2159, 1010, 24307, 2006, 1996, 5305, 2112, 1997, 1996, 2303, 1010, 2029, 2003, 2589, 2025, 2011, 1037, 23610, 2021, 2011, 6623, 8038, 5283, 2102, 1998, 2029, 2823, 21645, 1010, 3310, 2013, 13026, 4506, 1025, 1016, 1007, 2000, 16360, 2884, 7125, 8985, 1998, 2926, 1996, 2331, 1997, 28023, 1025, 1017, 1007, 2005, 4024, 1010, 2005, 1999, 2107, 3572, 1996, 23610, 2015, 2079, 12225, 1998, 2191, 17678, 15689, 3111, 1025, 1018, 1007, 2005, 1996, 3972, 15735, 3560, 1025, 2138, 1997, 2307, 4752, 1999, 23610, 2964, 1010, 2023, 7355, 3839, 5839, 7249, 2426, 1996, 8038, 5283, 2102, 1010, 2926, 2426, 3801, 1010, 2040, 2064, 2022, 3030, 2069, 2011, 2965, 1997, 23610, 2964, 1998, 4728, 3613, 2000, 9015, 1012, 2023, 7661, 1010, 1045, 1012, 1041, 1012, 1010, 23610, 2964, 1010, 2038, 6360, 2471, 2351, 2041, 2144, 1996, 8038, 5283, 2102, 4233, 1996, 3017, 4752, 1010, 1998, 2085, 2087, 1997, 1996, 8038, 5283, 2102, 1010, 4372, 7138, 6675, 2011, 4752, 1998, 1996, 3716, 1997, 1996, 3606, 1010, 6807, 2009, 2004, 18173, 1998, 3565, 16643, 3508, 1025, 2174, 1010, 2116, 2130, 1997, 1996, 4991, 8038, 5283, 2102, 1010, 2383, 10506, 2716, 2039, 1999, 1996, 6772, 1010, 10975, 18908, 5562, 2009, 1010, 2021, 1996, 8038, 5283, 2102, 2079, 2025, 5136, 2023, 16360, 2890, 10222, 19307, 1010, 11427, 2000, 1996, 16433, 1997, 1996, 7661, 1010, 1998, 3568, 2053, 20636, 9384, 5761, 2024, 2579, 1999, 2023, 4434, 1010, 1996, 2062, 2061, 2144, 1024, 1015, 1007, 1996, 8038, 5283, 2102, 2040, 10975, 18908, 5562, 23610, 2964, 2079, 2025, 5293, 2008, 2643, 6526, 1998, 2113, 2008, 2673, 2003, 2589, 2083, 2010, 26668, 2373, 1010, 2005, 2027, 2031, 2146, 2468, 17730, 2000, 3038, 1010, 2043, 1037, 2711, 8289, 1010, 1523, 2002, 2038, 2908, 2000, 2643, 1524, 1010, 2302, 20852, 3251, 1996, 2711, 2001, 19556, 2030, 8254, 3993, 1025, 6214, 2029, 5684, 2068, 2031, 2643, 1005, 1055, 2393, 1010, 1998, 10655, 2824, 2029, 17666, 2121, 2068, 1998, 13436, 2024, 3858, 2004, 2643, 1005, 1055, 7750, 2005, 15516, 1025, 1016, 1007, 2065, 23610, 2015, 2020, 2445, 9384, 7750, 1010, 2059, 2009, 2052, 2022, 4072, 2000, 16385, 2037, 12405, 2004, 2092, 1010, 2005, 2027, 102]}, {"score": 0.9389415383338928, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "The Aymara possess a wide variety of amulets ( ila ), many of which are purchased from the traveling doctors ( qolawayu ).

In the north of the Departamento of La Paz, young Aymara on their saint's day wear a necklace of beads with a qolqemunaci or little hand holding a \u201creal.\u201d This is to make one \u201cbeloved of money.\u201d If the person is a young man, he may add a warmimunaci so that he may be loved by a woman, and if a young woman she will add a cacamunaci (from muna\u00f1a \u201cto love\u201d) so that she will get a husband. In Calacota, Corocoro, Ayoayo, and in fact most of the altiplano they carry in their bundles a little yellow corkscrew-shaped seedpod called kuru from the yungas to protect them from bad luck. Sometimes they chew it and spit in the direction from which they believe the bad luck is coming; elsewhere they use kuru in the \u201ccorrida de toros\u201d by chewing it and spitting it in the direction of the bull, so that he will keep his distance. It is also useful to keep off lightning. Cloves of garlic have a similar efficacy in bull-fights and in warding off bad luck on a journey. An amulet to attract money is the aux-actir-qala (\u201cneedle-clutching-stone\u201d) or magnet, because of its ability to attract metal. The Aymara say that there are two kinds of magnets, a spiny, rough \u201cmale\u201d one and a smooth \u201cfemale\u201d one. The kolawayu doctors use and sell them, for they are a favorite kind of qolqemunaci or money-raising amulet. In the region of Sicasica the Indians put a little amulet bag around the reck of a child, on its chest, to protect it from bad luck, falls, wounds, hurts, and sickness; for a child wearing this, even if it is sleeping, cannot be menaced by a qariqari or ancancu . The typical contents of such an amulet bag are as follows: a small knife, some rosary beads, a small cross, a little salt, a small yellow chili, a piece of milu stone or alum, hawikulilu (the pip of a tropical fruit), ki\u00f1ulu root, a piece of indigo stone, and perhaps a pood or two of kuru .", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 3167, 25087, 2015, 2024, 2116, 1999, 2433, 1012, 1999, 1996, 2167, 1997, 1996, 18280, 24996, 2080, 1997, 2474, 18183, 1010, 2402, 1037, 24335, 5400, 2006, 2037, 3002, 1005, 1055, 2154, 4929, 1037, 13016, 1997, 17530, 2007, 1037, 1053, 4747, 4160, 6633, 9521, 6895, 2030, 2210, 2192, 3173, 1037, 1523, 2613, 1012, 1524, 2023, 2003, 2000, 2191, 2028, 1523, 11419, 1997, 2769, 1012, 1524, 2065, 1996, 2711, 2003, 1037, 2402, 2158, 1010, 2002, 2089, 5587, 1037, 4010, 5714, 9521, 6895, 2061, 2008, 2002, 2089, 2022, 3866, 2011, 1037, 2450, 1010, 1998, 2065, 1037, 2402, 2450, 2016, 2097, 5587, 1037, 6187, 28727, 9521, 6895, 1006, 2013, 14163, 7229, 2050, 1523, 2000, 2293, 1524, 1007, 2061, 2008, 2016, 2097, 2131, 1037, 3129, 1012, 1999, 10250, 22684, 2696, 1010, 2522, 3217, 27108, 2080, 1010, 1037, 7677, 28852, 1010, 1998, 1999, 2755, 2087, 1997, 1996, 12456, 11514, 5802, 2080, 2027, 4287, 1999, 2037, 26825, 1037, 2210, 3756, 8513, 11020, 15603, 1011, 5044, 6534, 27633, 2170, 13970, 6820, 2013, 1996, 22854, 12617, 2000, 4047, 2068, 2013, 2919, 6735, 1012, 2823, 2027, 21271, 2009, 1998, 13183, 1999, 1996, 3257, 2013, 2029, 2027, 2903, 1996, 2919, 6735, 2003, 2746, 1025, 6974, 2027, 2224, 13970, 6820, 1999, 1996, 1523, 2522, 18752, 2850, 2139, 23790, 2015, 1524, 2011, 17492, 2009, 1998, 24307, 2009, 1999, 1996, 3257, 1997, 1996, 7087, 1010, 2061, 2008, 2002, 2097, 2562, 2010, 3292, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2036, 6179, 2000, 2562, 2125, 7407, 1012, 18856, 21818, 2015, 1997, 20548, 2031, 1037, 2714, 21150, 1999, 7087, 1011, 9590, 1998, 1999, 4829, 2075, 2125, 2919, 6735, 2006, 1037, 4990, 1012, 2019, 25087, 2000, 9958, 2769, 2003, 1996, 19554, 1011, 2552, 4313, 1011, 1053, 7911, 1006, 1523, 12201, 1011, 14197, 1011, 2962, 1524, 1007, 2030, 16853, 1010, 2138, 1997, 2049, 3754, 2000, 9958, 3384, 1012, 1996, 1037, 24335, 5400, 2360, 2008, 2045, 2024, 2048, 7957, 1997, 16853, 2015, 1010, 1037, 6714, 2100, 1010, 5931, 1523, 3287, 1524, 2028, 1998, 1037, 5744, 1523, 2931, 1524, 2028, 1012, 1996, 12849, 14919, 4710, 2226, 7435, 2224, 1998, 5271, 2068, 1010, 2005, 2027, 2024, 1037, 5440, 2785, 1997, 1053, 4747, 4160, 6633, 9521, 6895, 2030, 2769, 1011, 6274, 25087, 1012, 1999, 1996, 2555, 1997, 14387, 21369, 3540, 1996, 6505, 2404, 1037, 2210, 25087, 4524, 2105, 1996, 28667, 2243, 1997, 1037, 2775, 1010, 2006, 2049, 3108, 1010, 2000, 4047, 2009, 2013, 2919, 6735, 1010, 4212, 1010, 8710, 1010, 13403, 1010, 1998, 15556, 1025, 2005, 1037, 2775, 4147, 2023, 1010, 2130, 2065, 2009, 2003, 5777, 1010, 3685, 2022, 19854, 2094, 2011, 1037, 1053, 8486, 19062, 3089, 2030, 2019, 9336, 10841, 1012, 1996, 5171, 8417, 1997, 2107, 2019, 25087, 4524, 2024, 2004, 4076, 1024, 1037, 2235, 5442, 1010, 2070, 28291, 17530, 1010, 1037, 2235, 2892, 1010, 1037, 2210, 5474, 1010, 1037, 2235, 3756, 20238, 1010, 1037, 3538, 1997, 23689, 2226, 2962, 2030, 2632, 2819, 1010, 5292, 9148, 5283, 3669, 7630, 1006, 1996, 28315, 1997, 1037, 5133, 5909, 1007, 1010, 12631, 20391, 7117, 1010, 1037, 3538, 1997, 22472, 2962, 1010, 1998, 3383, 1037, 13433, 7716, 2030, 2048, 1997, 13970, 6820, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.8744668364524841, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "In the Indian markets of La Paz all these amulets and many more can be bought.

Skulls have been found with as many as five successful trepanations--which argues for a certain skill in the surgeon, as well as for the vitality of the patient. Krogman 313 Krogman, 1939, p. 12; Ronhaar, 1930, passim . Without having examined the physical evidence which might prove this contention, I believe on other evidence (such as the frequent and severe migraine of the Aymara) that a very plausible case might be made also for the alternative purpose. There is every reason to believe, however, that both motives could have operated. In this connection it is interesting to recall the legend, reported by Vara Cadillo, of the Ichik Ol'qo or child-demon, which inhabits waterfalls and foundtains, growling angrily, and throwing out a rainbow from his navel, by which he exerts an evil influence upon men through the crowns of their heads. Note also the Aymara belief in a vampire-head which sucks blood from the occipital region. considers that the purpose of trephining was to relieve compression fractures of the skull caused by warclubs, but Ronhaar believes that trephining was performed most often for epilepsy or migraine (if the epilepsy were traumatic, it comes to the same thing).

By massaging the arms and the torso carefully, and by binding with a wide textile girdle, the visceral dislocations of the patient are reduced, and he is cured. In the t'alanta procedure previously mentioned the patient is also sometimes tossed gently in a poncho held by serveral people, until his organs return to their proper position. The processes of truq'aq'a and p'ic'aq'a involve rubbing certain substances upon the body of the sick person, but with a different motive: to absorb the evil spirit which has entered, so that it may be tempted away by libations and sacrifices. A similar practice is lumaq'a , or \u201cpurification.\u201d Some diseases like tertian fever can be cured by frightening the patient severely, for then the evil spirit will abandon his body. One of the fevers, which has the appearance of a skeleton-thin woman with disheveled hair, can be so cured.

The coffin was lowered into the grave, let down by two ropes slung under it, one at either end. A member of the funeral party jumped down into the grave, raised the lid of the coffin, and untied and removed the cord which had been knotted around the throat of the dead man. As he climbed out, first he and then others around the grave threw earth into the grave on top of the coffin. The paqo or man in charge of the ceremonies said a few worde of prayer before the grave was shoveled full. A mound formed by the earth displaced by the coffin was smoothed off over the grave and a crude wooden cross stuck into it. The wreath and flowers carried on the coffin during the procession were placed on top of this mound. In addition, coca and alcohol were placed on top of the grave, to be rescued later in the day for general consumption. Nothing was buried with the corpse, but people recognize that in the past household and other items were buried, too. They know this because they run into old graves during their construction work. Tschopik notes the practice in Chucuito of the widow putting a stone inside her blouse near her heart. The stone was taken from a ditch of running water and the rational was that she should forget her sorrow for her dead husband just as \u201cthe stone feels nothing when the water runs over it.\u201d Tschopik further notes that the women mourners reverse their clothing after leaving the grave area, and any children present must step across the grave to avoid coming down with a serious sickness ( orijjo ) caused by the souls of the dead. The party leaves the grave area in a mixed group, and returns to the house of the deceased. Tschopik notes that a separate path is taken than that taken for the original procession.

Aymara magicians frequently claim that they had been struck by lightning and thus knew that they had been singled out by the spirits to become magicians. Quintin, a Capilaya magician, attributed his decision to become a magician to a prolonged illness. He became a maestro when he was well in his forties. He had been living in La Paz for ten years and had become ill. After entering a hospital his health improved somewhat. Soon afterwards his compadre , a maestro who could \u201cread the coca\u201d revealed to him that his illness was caused by supernatural forces, a sign that he should become a maestro , too. Quintin then returned to Compi and asked a yatiri from Jank'o Amaya to help him request the Achachila of Kakape, a Compi mountain, to give him permission to practice magic. During part of the trip up the hill Quintin rode on a donkey, still feeling too weak from his illness to walk; halfway up he suddenly felt better and was able to proceed on foot. He claims that from that moment on there has been no illness in his family. On top of Kakape the initiation took place with a sacrifice to the mountain's achachila . Later the wife of another yatiri suggested that Quintin affirm his position as maestro by making a pilgrimage to Oje, a community whose patron saint, an image of Saint Peter, is considered to be endowed with miraculous powers. Favorable circumstances, however, elevated Quintin to the position of section magician that very same year and thus the trip to Oje became unnecessary. In previous years there had been no magicians in Capilaya. Feliciano, a Compeno who was at the same time sot'a , or chief aide to the mayordome of the hacienda, an administrator hated in the community because of the unpopular measures he had introduced in Compi to gain the favor of the patr\u00f3n, acted as magician of both Compi proper and Capilaya. The year Quintin became a magician the harvest in Capilaya had been bad because hail had fallen in that section alone, sparing the rest of the hacienda. This was attributed to Feliciano's disinterest in a section to which he did not belong. Thus the Capilaya colonos asked Quintin to direct the important hail ceremonies. According to the magician, the crops produced abundantly again during subsequent years forcing even the patr\u00f3n to recognize him as section magician in spite of the intrigues of Feliciano.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2025, 7955, 2003, 2641, 5214, 1997, 3352, 1037, 16669, 1012, 1037, 24335, 5400, 16669, 2015, 4703, 4366, 2008, 2027, 2018, 2042, 4930, 2011, 7407, 1998, 2947, 2354, 2008, 2027, 2018, 2042, 25369, 2041, 2011, 1996, 8633, 2000, 2468, 16669, 2015, 1012, 21864, 16778, 2078, 1010, 1037, 6178, 11733, 3148, 16669, 1010, 7108, 2010, 3247, 2000, 2468, 1037, 16669, 2000, 1037, 15330, 7355, 1012, 2002, 2150, 1037, 25270, 2043, 2002, 2001, 2092, 1999, 2010, 3481, 3111, 1012, 2002, 2018, 2042, 2542, 1999, 2474, 18183, 2005, 2702, 2086, 1998, 2018, 2468, 5665, 1012, 2044, 5738, 1037, 2902, 2010, 2740, 5301, 5399, 1012, 2574, 5728, 2010, 4012, 15455, 2890, 1010, 1037, 25270, 2040, 2071, 1523, 3191, 1996, 16787, 1524, 3936, 2000, 2032, 2008, 2010, 7355, 2001, 3303, 2011, 11189, 2749, 1010, 1037, 3696, 2008, 2002, 2323, 2468, 1037, 25270, 1010, 2205, 1012, 21864, 16778, 2078, 2059, 2513, 2000, 4012, 8197, 1998, 2356, 1037, 8038, 3775, 3089, 2013, 5553, 2243, 1005, 1051, 25933, 3148, 2000, 2393, 2032, 5227, 1996, 9353, 3270, 5428, 2721, 1997, 10556, 2912, 5051, 1010, 1037, 4012, 8197, 3137, 1010, 2000, 2507, 2032, 6656, 2000, 3218, 3894, 1012, 2076, 2112, 1997, 1996, 4440, 2039, 1996, 2940, 21864, 16778, 2078, 8469, 2006, 1037, 20325, 1010, 2145, 3110, 2205, 5410, 2013, 2010, 7355, 2000, 3328, 1025, 8576, 2039, 2002, 3402, 2371, 2488, 1998, 2001, 2583, 2000, 10838, 2006, 3329, 1012, 2002, 4447, 2008, 2013, 2008, 2617, 2006, 2045, 2038, 2042, 2053, 7355, 1999, 2010, 2155, 1012, 2006, 2327, 1997, 10556, 2912, 5051, 1996, 17890, 2165, 2173, 2007, 1037, 8688, 2000, 1996, 3137, 1005, 1055, 9353, 3270, 5428, 2721, 1012, 2101, 1996, 2564, 1997, 2178, 8038, 3775, 3089, 4081, 2008, 21864, 16778, 2078, 21358, 27972, 2010, 2597, 2004, 25270, 2011, 2437, 1037, 14741, 2000, 1051, 6460, 1010, 1037, 2451, 3005, 9161, 3002, 1010, 2019, 3746, 1997, 3002, 2848, 1010, 2003, 2641, 2000, 2022, 19038, 2007, 26106, 4204, 1012, 11119, 6214, 1010, 2174, 1010, 8319, 21864, 16778, 2078, 2000, 1996, 2597, 1997, 2930, 16669, 2008, 2200, 2168, 2095, 1998, 2947, 1996, 4440, 2000, 1051, 6460, 2150, 14203, 1012, 1999, 3025, 2086, 2045, 2018, 2042, 2053, 16669, 2015, 1999, 6178, 11733, 3148, 1012, 27579, 3630, 1010, 1037, 4012, 11837, 2080, 2040, 2001, 2012, 1996, 2168, 2051, 2061, 2102, 1005, 1037, 1010, 2030, 2708, 14895, 2000, 1996, 3664, 26173, 1997, 1996, 5292, 23402, 8943, 1010, 2019, 8911, 6283, 1999, 1996, 2451, 2138, 1997, 1996, 19657, 5761, 2002, 2018, 3107, 1999, 4012, 8197, 2000, 5114, 1996, 5684, 1997, 1996, 9161, 1010, 6051, 2004, 16669, 1997, 2119, 4012, 8197, 5372, 1998, 6178, 11733, 3148, 1012, 1996, 2095, 21864, 16778, 2078, 2150, 1037, 16669, 1996, 11203, 1999, 6178, 11733, 3148, 2018, 2042, 2919, 2138, 16889, 2018, 5357, 1999, 2008, 2930, 2894, 1010, 12403, 4892, 1996, 2717, 1997, 1996, 5292, 23402, 8943, 1012, 2023, 2001, 7108, 2000, 27579, 3630, 1005, 1055, 4487, 11493, 3334, 4355, 1999, 1037, 2930, 2000, 2029, 2002, 2106, 2025, 7141, 1012, 2947, 1996, 6178, 11733, 3148, 16844, 2891, 2356, 21864, 16778, 2078, 2000, 3622, 1996, 2590, 16889, 10912, 1012, 2429, 2000, 1996, 16669, 1010, 1996, 8765, 2550, 102]}, {"score": 0.961061418056488, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Apart from the process of becoming a magician, Quintin's case also illustrates how modern medicine (represented by the La Paz hospital), Catholicism (the desirability of the magicians' endorsement by the image of Saint Peter in Oje), and magic are not considered to be incompatible but instead have complementary or reinforcing functions in an individual's life.

The yatiri , or curer, should be called in such a situation in order to recall the animo , 4 According to other yatiri the ayayu , a second soul, is the soul which is lost. The third soul is a person's coraje , (or \u201ccourage\u201d). one of the three souls a person possesses. This is accomplished in the following manner. A piece of the patient's clothing is laid on the ground, a short distance from the patient's house by the maestro . He is accompanied by at least one friend or a relative of the patient. Near the patient's clothing is put the contents of llama entrails, gall stones diluted in holy water in a little cup, with St. Nicholas bread (a sort of wafer with the image of St. Nicholas) and chinchi chinchi (unidentified fruit). Then they both retreat to the house. After this, the curer calls to and libates the animo with alcohol. In the meantime, the patient is supposed to sleep in order for the soul to reenter its abode. (Sleep may be considered an intermediary between life and death.) While waiting for the soul's return during the patient's sleep, other animos may appear. These are the animos of persons who will fall ill in the near future, and can be clearly identified. When the patient's animo arrives it has to be enveloped immediately in the clothing. They (the curer and his assistant) then place the clothing beside the patient, making him drink some of the holy water and wash his face. Then they put the clothing on the patient. During the process of calling the soul, wool spun in reverse is also used. One tears small pieces and throws them to the wind, calling the soul as one throws. The next day this wool is burned and the patient must drink the ashes mixed with water. Yarn spun in reverse is also placed in the patient's hands and on the ground around him so that the soul may not escape. If the patient does not recover, this may be due to complications with other spirits, such as a lake, or other achachila , or rayo (lightning or site where lightning has struck). A mesa (burnt offering) has to be given on the site where the person experienced a susto , or at the site where lightning has struck. However, susto may also be cured by natural herbal remedies such as a brew of thapi (unidentified), chinchi chinchi or chhojjlla (grass).", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 24757, 2089, 2022, 3303, 2011, 10514, 16033, 1010, 2030, 25966, 1012, 15933, 2076, 1996, 2154, 2030, 2305, 2028, 2089, 2022, 10363, 2011, 2019, 4111, 2030, 2019, 10439, 8486, 3508, 1997, 2019, 4111, 2107, 2004, 1037, 3899, 2030, 1037, 20325, 1012, 1037, 2711, 2453, 2991, 5665, 2007, 1037, 14978, 2030, 1997, 2019, 7355, 1997, 1996, 2398, 1010, 2519, 1010, 5551, 1010, 2030, 2159, 1012, 1996, 8038, 3775, 3089, 1010, 2030, 9526, 2099, 1010, 2323, 2022, 2170, 1999, 2107, 1037, 3663, 1999, 2344, 2000, 9131, 1996, 2019, 16339, 1010, 1018, 2429, 2000, 2060, 8038, 3775, 3089, 1996, 1037, 3148, 10513, 1010, 1037, 2117, 3969, 1010, 2003, 1996, 3969, 2029, 2003, 2439, 1012, 1996, 2353, 3969, 2003, 1037, 2711, 1005, 1055, 17195, 6460, 1010, 1006, 2030, 1523, 8424, 1524, 1007, 1012, 2028, 1997, 1996, 2093, 9293, 1037, 2711, 14882, 1012, 2023, 2003, 8885, 1999, 1996, 2206, 5450, 1012, 1037, 3538, 1997, 1996, 5776, 1005, 1055, 5929, 2003, 4201, 2006, 1996, 2598, 1010, 1037, 2460, 3292, 2013, 1996, 5776, 1005, 1055, 2160, 2011, 1996, 25270, 1012, 2002, 2003, 5642, 2011, 2012, 2560, 2028, 2767, 2030, 1037, 5816, 1997, 1996, 5776, 1012, 2379, 1996, 5776, 1005, 1055, 5929, 2003, 2404, 1996, 8417, 1997, 2222, 8067, 4372, 6494, 12146, 1010, 26033, 6386, 29454, 12926, 1999, 4151, 2300, 1999, 1037, 2210, 2452, 1010, 2007, 2358, 1012, 6141, 7852, 1006, 1037, 4066, 1997, 11333, 7512, 2007, 1996, 3746, 1997, 2358, 1012, 6141, 1007, 1998, 5413, 5428, 5413, 5428, 1006, 20293, 5909, 1007, 1012, 2059, 2027, 2119, 7822, 2000, 1996, 2160, 1012, 2044, 2023, 1010, 1996, 9526, 2099, 4455, 2000, 1998, 5622, 20179, 2015, 1996, 2019, 16339, 2007, 6544, 1012, 1999, 1996, 12507, 1010, 1996, 5776, 2003, 4011, 2000, 3637, 1999, 2344, 2005, 1996, 3969, 2000, 2128, 29110, 2049, 11113, 10244, 1012, 1006, 3637, 2089, 2022, 2641, 2019, 6970, 16969, 2854, 2090, 2166, 1998, 2331, 1012, 1007, 2096, 3403, 2005, 1996, 3969, 1005, 1055, 2709, 2076, 1996, 5776, 1005, 1055, 3637, 1010, 2060, 2019, 16339, 2015, 2089, 3711, 1012, 2122, 2024, 1996, 2019, 16339, 2015, 1997, 5381, 2040, 2097, 2991, 5665, 1999, 1996, 2379, 2925, 1010, 1998, 2064, 2022, 4415, 4453, 1012, 2043, 1996, 5776, 1005, 1055, 2019, 16339, 8480, 2009, 2038, 2000, 2022, 25407, 3202, 1999, 1996, 5929, 1012, 2027, 1006, 1996, 9526, 2099, 1998, 2010, 3353, 1007, 2059, 2173, 1996, 5929, 3875, 1996, 5776, 1010, 2437, 2032, 4392, 2070, 1997, 1996, 4151, 2300, 1998, 9378, 2010, 2227, 1012, 2059, 2027, 2404, 1996, 5929, 2006, 1996, 5776, 1012, 2076, 1996, 2832, 1997, 4214, 1996, 3969, 1010, 12121, 7455, 1999, 7901, 2003, 2036, 2109, 1012, 2028, 4000, 2235, 4109, 1998, 11618, 2068, 2000, 1996, 3612, 1010, 4214, 1996, 3969, 2004, 2028, 11618, 1012, 1996, 2279, 2154, 2023, 12121, 2003, 5296, 1998, 1996, 5776, 2442, 4392, 1996, 11289, 3816, 2007, 2300, 1012, 27158, 7455, 1999, 7901, 2003, 2036, 2872, 1999, 1996, 5776, 1005, 1055, 2398, 1998, 2006, 1996, 2598, 2105, 2032, 2061, 2008, 1996, 3969, 2089, 2025, 4019, 1012, 2065, 1996, 5776, 2515, 2025, 8980, 1010, 2023, 2089, 2022, 2349, 2000, 12763, 2007, 2060, 8633, 1010, 2107, 2004, 1037, 2697, 102]}, {"score": 0.8486210703849792, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "As we have seen, illness is caused by both natural and supernatural phenomena.

In Sicasica, Loayza, parts of Pacajes and Omasuyos (and perhaps elsewhere), the Aymara use the sulu of the llama to put beneath the house foundations, for they say oraerux waxtanau , \u201cit is necessary to make sacrifice to the Earth.\u201d", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 2222, 8067, 10768, 5809, 2003, 2788, 3214, 2011, 1996, 1037, 24335, 5400, 2744, 21396, 2226, 1010, 2295, 2009, 2003, 2036, 4162, 2000, 1996, 10768, 5809, 1997, 1996, 10369, 2030, 1996, 8351, 1012, 1996, 1037, 24335, 5400, 2562, 1998, 5271, 2116, 1997, 2122, 2005, 2966, 1998, 8687, 5682, 1012, 1996, 21396, 2226, 1997, 1037, 10369, 2003, 2204, 2000, 3298, 7942, 2185, 1025, 2009, 2003, 2109, 2007, 1523, 4241, 23314, 2015, 1524, 1998, 6910, 12121, 2015, 1999, 1037, 5103, 3832, 2000, 3298, 1996, 5698, 2013, 1037, 2711, 2040, 2003, 5305, 2030, 4689, 1012, 1999, 14387, 21369, 3540, 1010, 8840, 4710, 4143, 1010, 3033, 1997, 14397, 13006, 2229, 1998, 18168, 3022, 26230, 2891, 1006, 1998, 3383, 6974, 1007, 1010, 1996, 1037, 24335, 5400, 2224, 1996, 21396, 2226, 1997, 1996, 2222, 8067, 2000, 2404, 4218, 1996, 2160, 10100, 1010, 2005, 2027, 2360, 2030, 27867, 5602, 13844, 20496, 2226, 1010, 1523, 2009, 2003, 4072, 2000, 2191, 8688, 2000, 1996, 3011, 1012, 1524, 102]}, {"score": 0.7290117740631104, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "Owl feathers are put in their hats by the Aymara to protect themselves from rifle bullets.", "predicted_label": 0, "input_ids": [101, 13547, 12261, 2024, 2404, 1999, 2037, 16717, 2011, 1996, 1037, 24335, 5400, 2000, 4047, 3209, 2013, 5883, 10432, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.8254667520523071, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "Rabbit- and fish-oil (from the suci fish) is rubbed on the skin to aid the removal of a splinter or a thorn.", "predicted_label": 0, "input_ids": [101, 10442, 1011, 1998, 3869, 1011, 3514, 1006, 2013, 1996, 10514, 6895, 3869, 1007, 2003, 7503, 2006, 1996, 3096, 2000, 4681, 1996, 8208, 1997, 1037, 27546, 2030, 1037, 16337, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.853305995464325, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "The urine of the cow, or that of a black she-burro, is taken to cure jaundice. The urine of the skunk is thought to blind human beings. Human urine has many medicinal uses among the Aymara. Newborn babies are given spoonfuls of human urine (especially that of young children) until the milk appears in the mother. Fermented human urine, tamata , is also widely used. Every house has its yuru ( tamatutu or tamat wakula ) or pottery jar for saving urine; compare Bertonio (Vol. 2, p. 81) \u201cChillami: Orinal como bacinilla o mate.\u201d When a person gets the mange, they say that he is oraen katxata , \u201ccaught or fished by the earth\u201d; washing with tamata or \u201corina podrida\u201d is one of the best cures for this disease. For this term, compare Bertonio (Vol. 2, p. 238) \u201cTtamatayacca: Orines podridos.\u201d Aymara women wash their hair in fer mented urine, as it is said to kill fleas, lapanaka , in the hair, as well as to \u201ccut\u201d the grease because of the ammonia in it; very dirty and greasy clothes are also sometimes washed in tamata . When a person has a fever, he is washed all over with fermented human urine; Garcilaso (bk. ii, ch. XXIV) says that when a suckling was feverish, it was washed in urine in the morning, and if they could obtain some of the child's own urine, it was given to it to drink. As has already been mentioned, urine is also mixed with other substances, notably with the viscous pounded mass of the berries of some of the American mistletoes ( Phoradendron spp., Loranthaceae) as an ointment. When a glandular or goitrous swelling is adjudged to have come from contact with the spittle of a frog, the place is washed with tamata and salt. When a baby is sick, the milucana ceremony may be performed by the yatiri (one type of Aymara medicine-man). A piece of milu or alum is put on the child's chest and left there three or four hours until night. The yatiri then rubs the milu all over the little patient's body, after which he puts the stone into a large bowl of tamata . This is then covered with a lihla or other woollen cloth and left for twenty minutes to half an hour. When the bowl is uncovered, the milu is seen to have swelled up like a sponge (from the chemical action), usually into figures which the yatiri is able to study for his diagnosis. Then he says: \u201cThis child was frightened at such-and-such a spring,\u201d or \u201cHe will get well,\u201d or \u201cHe will die.\u201d When the augury is bad, he takes a knife, and cuts the spongy mass with appropriate exorcisms, makes a hole in the ground and buries it. This diagnostic technique is of course especially valuable for the ailments of children, who cannot be expected to verbalize about such abstruse matters with any fluency; the same technique, however, is also used in the case of adult ailments, when the cause of the disease baffles even the yatiri . Finally, urine has a therapeutic value in the apsuyasi\u00f1a type of counter-witchcraft. In this the house of the sick man is carefully searched and sounded for hollow places with a weavingbatten, and when the place where the sickness is hiding is found, the camakani or camakiri (other kinds of Aymara medical practitioners) throws some of the sick man's urine on it together with salt, and sometimes with other substances. The sickness then enters the urine and salt, which is then gathered up and thrown into a river, or burnt at a cross-roads, where the next unfortunate passerby will become the \u201chost\u201d of the disease. Best of all is for the camakani to obtain by stealth some of the urine of the rival witch who is causing the disease. The sick man is bathed in this urine, which is then thrown surreptitiously outside the witch's door. In this way the witchcraft-induced disease \u201ccomes home to roost,\u201d where it belongs.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 17996, 1997, 1996, 11190, 1010, 2030, 2008, 1997, 1037, 2304, 2016, 1011, 22715, 2080, 1010, 2003, 2579, 2000, 9526, 14855, 8630, 6610, 1012, 1996, 17996, 1997, 1996, 15315, 16814, 2003, 2245, 2000, 6397, 2529, 9552, 1012, 2529, 17996, 2038, 2116, 20632, 3594, 2426, 1996, 1037, 24335, 5400, 1012, 20662, 10834, 2024, 2445, 15642, 3993, 2015, 1997, 2529, 17996, 1006, 2926, 2008, 1997, 2402, 2336, 1007, 2127, 1996, 6501, 3544, 1999, 1996, 2388, 1012, 10768, 10867, 14088, 2529, 17996, 1010, 17214, 6790, 1010, 2003, 2036, 4235, 2109, 1012, 2296, 2160, 2038, 2049, 9805, 6820, 1006, 17214, 4017, 4904, 2226, 2030, 17214, 4017, 11333, 5283, 2721, 1007, 2030, 11378, 15723, 2005, 7494, 17996, 1025, 12826, 14324, 10698, 2080, 1006, 5285, 1012, 1016, 1010, 1052, 1012, 6282, 1007, 1523, 10720, 10631, 1024, 2030, 13290, 18609, 8670, 27085, 4571, 1051, 6775, 1012, 1524, 2043, 1037, 2711, 4152, 1996, 2158, 3351, 1010, 2027, 2360, 2008, 2002, 2003, 2030, 6679, 2078, 10645, 18684, 2696, 1010, 1523, 3236, 2030, 26281, 2011, 1996, 3011, 1524, 1025, 12699, 2007, 17214, 6790, 2030, 1523, 2030, 3981, 17491, 14615, 2050, 1524, 2003, 2028, 1997, 1996, 2190, 9526, 2015, 2005, 2023, 4295, 1012, 2005, 2023, 2744, 1010, 12826, 14324, 10698, 2080, 1006, 5285, 1012, 1016, 1010, 1052, 1012, 22030, 1007, 1523, 23746, 8067, 2696, 3148, 16665, 1024, 2030, 10586, 17491, 14615, 2891, 1012, 1524, 1037, 24335, 5400, 2308, 9378, 2037, 2606, 1999, 10768, 2099, 2273, 3064, 17996, 1010, 2004, 2009, 2003, 2056, 2000, 3102, 26735, 2015, 1010, 5001, 5162, 2912, 1010, 1999, 1996, 2606, 1010, 2004, 2092, 2004, 2000, 1523, 3013, 1524, 1996, 21956, 2138, 1997, 1996, 25874, 1999, 2009, 1025, 2200, 6530, 1998, 26484, 4253, 2024, 2036, 2823, 8871, 1999, 17214, 6790, 1012, 2043, 1037, 2711, 2038, 1037, 9016, 1010, 2002, 2003, 8871, 2035, 2058, 2007, 10768, 10867, 14088, 2529, 17996, 1025, 11721, 11890, 11733, 6499, 1006, 23923, 1012, 2462, 1010, 10381, 1012, 22038, 12848, 1007, 2758, 2008, 2043, 1037, 11891, 2989, 2001, 9016, 4509, 1010, 2009, 2001, 8871, 1999, 17996, 1999, 1996, 2851, 1010, 1998, 2065, 2027, 2071, 6855, 2070, 1997, 1996, 2775, 1005, 1055, 2219, 17996, 1010, 2009, 2001, 2445, 2000, 2009, 2000, 4392, 1012, 2004, 2038, 2525, 2042, 3855, 1010, 17996, 2003, 2036, 3816, 2007, 2060, 13978, 1010, 5546, 2007, 1996, 25292, 27199, 13750, 3742, 1997, 1996, 22681, 1997, 2070, 1997, 1996, 2137, 11094, 7485, 22504, 1006, 6887, 6525, 4181, 19440, 26924, 1012, 1010, 8840, 17884, 3270, 9071, 1007, 2004, 2019, 1051, 18447, 3672, 1012, 2043, 1037, 25320, 7934, 2030, 2175, 4183, 13288, 18348, 2003, 4748, 9103, 11818, 2094, 2000, 2031, 2272, 2013, 3967, 2007, 1996, 13183, 9286, 1997, 1037, 10729, 1010, 1996, 2173, 2003, 8871, 2007, 17214, 6790, 1998, 5474, 1012, 2043, 1037, 3336, 2003, 5305, 1010, 1996, 23689, 18100, 2532, 5103, 2089, 2022, 2864, 2011, 1996, 8038, 3775, 3089, 1006, 2028, 2828, 1997, 1037, 24335, 5400, 4200, 1011, 2158, 1007, 1012, 1037, 3538, 1997, 23689, 2226, 2030, 2632, 2819, 2003, 2404, 2006, 1996, 2775, 1005, 1055, 3108, 1998, 2187, 2045, 2093, 2030, 2176, 2847, 2127, 2305, 1012, 1996, 8038, 3775, 3089, 2059, 28860, 1996, 23689, 102]}, {"score": 0.8544453978538513, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "Aymara medicines of mineral origin are quickly considered.

Paredes' belief that these attitudes result from missionary teaching is almost certainly incorrect. 3 Paredes, 1936, 228-229. Far from being so uncomplicated, the explanation of this fear of the dead is complex, and several component beliefs must be considered independently. First, the corpse itself, as well as associated objects, is thought to be a potential source of a certain disease, orixa , to which children are particularly susceptible. Second, all ghosts of adults, irrespective of the dispositions of their former earthly counterparts, are naturally malevolent, and may send disease or, according to folk tales, cause death in other ways. 4 Informants were undecided as to whether or not children produced ghosts; at any rate, the ghosts of children (if they exist) are not feared (11, 43). Finally, the souls of the dead, either out of sheer jealousy of the living, or because of loneliness, frequently attempt to drag relatives and friends along with them to the hereafter. 1 As is shown below, it is close relatives who are most apt to be harmed by the dead. Similarly, it should be noted, in cases of sorcery the first suspicion of guilt falls upon close relatives. Indeed, as lias been demonstrated, the Aymara today is forced to compete for his very livelihood with his close relatives. It seems possible, therefore, to regard this fear of corpses, ghosts, and souls in part as a projection of repressed hostility towards parents and near relatives into the realm of the dead. This is especially true of the souls of children, and many omens are interpreted to mean that the deceased child desires the death of a sibling. 2 Perhaps this belief is to be understood as a projection of sibling rivalry, a phenomenon of which the Aymara themselves are well aware. There is, on the contrary, no evidence whatever from Chucuito to indicate that the dead ever seek to benefit the living (except to warn them of impending disaster) or that souls are regarded as guardians or protectors. 3 Paredes writes that the souls of the dead are believed to watch over and protect their relatives and the community as a whole; while they never abandon their kinsmen, these souls may punish the living if they deserve it.

Indeed, the return of the souls during All Saints fiesta in November is believed to prevent rain when it is most meeded and the exposed bones of the dead are thought to cause drought (2). It is also desirable to slaughter livestock for meat before All Souls day, since the returning souls are said to steal the fat of these animals (43).", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2009, 2003, 4895, 15500, 3258, 8231, 2995, 2008, 1996, 1037, 24335, 5400, 6171, 3571, 1996, 2757, 1998, 1996, 6214, 4193, 2331, 1012, 11968, 18352, 1005, 6772, 2008, 2122, 13818, 2765, 2013, 8696, 4252, 2003, 2471, 5121, 16542, 1012, 1017, 11968, 18352, 1010, 4266, 1010, 22238, 1011, 22777, 1012, 2521, 2013, 2108, 2061, 4895, 9006, 24759, 17872, 1010, 1996, 7526, 1997, 2023, 3571, 1997, 1996, 2757, 2003, 3375, 1010, 1998, 2195, 6922, 9029, 2442, 2022, 2641, 9174, 1012, 2034, 1010, 1996, 11547, 2993, 1010, 2004, 2092, 2004, 3378, 5200, 1010, 2003, 2245, 2000, 2022, 1037, 4022, 3120, 1997, 1037, 3056, 4295, 1010, 2030, 7646, 2050, 1010, 2000, 2029, 2336, 2024, 3391, 18002, 1012, 2117, 1010, 2035, 11277, 1997, 6001, 1010, 20868, 6072, 5051, 15277, 1997, 1996, 22137, 2015, 1997, 2037, 2280, 29520, 14562, 1010, 2024, 8100, 3287, 6767, 16136, 1010, 1998, 2089, 4604, 4295, 2030, 1010, 2429, 2000, 5154, 7122, 1010, 3426, 2331, 1999, 2060, 3971, 1012, 1018, 28694, 2015, 2020, 6151, 8586, 14097, 2004, 2000, 3251, 2030, 2025, 2336, 2550, 11277, 1025, 2012, 2151, 3446, 1010, 1996, 11277, 1997, 2336, 1006, 2065, 2027, 4839, 1007, 2024, 2025, 8615, 1006, 2340, 1010, 4724, 1007, 1012, 2633, 1010, 1996, 9293, 1997, 1996, 2757, 1010, 2593, 2041, 1997, 11591, 14225, 1997, 1996, 2542, 1010, 2030, 2138, 1997, 20334, 1010, 4703, 3535, 2000, 8011, 9064, 1998, 2814, 2247, 2007, 2068, 2000, 1996, 2182, 10354, 3334, 1012, 1015, 2004, 2003, 3491, 2917, 1010, 2009, 2003, 2485, 9064, 2040, 2024, 2087, 26794, 2000, 2022, 25596, 2011, 1996, 2757, 1012, 6660, 1010, 2009, 2323, 2022, 3264, 1010, 1999, 3572, 1997, 2061, 19170, 2854, 1996, 2034, 10928, 1997, 8056, 4212, 2588, 2485, 9064, 1012, 5262, 1010, 2004, 22393, 2015, 2042, 7645, 1010, 1996, 1037, 24335, 5400, 2651, 2003, 3140, 2000, 5566, 2005, 2010, 2200, 24585, 2007, 2010, 2485, 9064, 1012, 2009, 3849, 2825, 1010, 3568, 1010, 2000, 7634, 2023, 3571, 1997, 18113, 1010, 11277, 1010, 1998, 9293, 1999, 2112, 2004, 1037, 13996, 1997, 16360, 16119, 18258, 2875, 3008, 1998, 2379, 9064, 2046, 1996, 8391, 1997, 1996, 2757, 1012, 2023, 2003, 2926, 2995, 1997, 1996, 9293, 1997, 2336, 1010, 1998, 2116, 18168, 6132, 2024, 10009, 2000, 2812, 2008, 1996, 10181, 2775, 14714, 1996, 2331, 1997, 1037, 22941, 1012, 1016, 3383, 2023, 6772, 2003, 2000, 2022, 5319, 2004, 1037, 13996, 1997, 22941, 10685, 1010, 1037, 9575, 1997, 2029, 1996, 1037, 24335, 5400, 3209, 2024, 2092, 5204, 1012, 2045, 2003, 1010, 2006, 1996, 10043, 1010, 2053, 3350, 3649, 2013, 14684, 28168, 2080, 2000, 5769, 2008, 1996, 2757, 2412, 6148, 2000, 5770, 1996, 2542, 1006, 3272, 2000, 11582, 2068, 1997, 17945, 7071, 1007, 2030, 2008, 9293, 2024, 5240, 2004, 14240, 2030, 16167, 2015, 1012, 1017, 11968, 18352, 7009, 2008, 1996, 9293, 1997, 1996, 2757, 2024, 3373, 2000, 3422, 2058, 1998, 4047, 2037, 9064, 1998, 1996, 2451, 2004, 1037, 2878, 1025, 2096, 2027, 2196, 10824, 2037, 12631, 6491, 2368, 1010, 2122, 9293, 2089, 16385, 1996, 2542, 2065, 2027, 10107, 2009, 1012, 11968, 18352, 1010, 3918, 1010, 19235, 1011, 18164, 1012, 5262, 1010, 1996, 2709, 1997, 1996, 9293, 2076, 2035, 6586, 24050, 1999, 2281, 102]}, {"score": 0.9467523097991943, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "It is also necessary to protect the living against sickness and other possible misfortunes.

Either these views are over-simple, or the disease theory of the Bolivian Aymara is considerably less complex than is true of the Aymara of Peru. In Chucuito, as has been shown, some diseases are clearly due to sorcery, either directly or indirectly. Others, however, are sent by spirits of their own volition (because they have been angered or slighted), or by permanent and naturally malevolent demons. Still others are contracted from souls and ghosts. Some ailments stem from accidental soul loss, while in others soul kidnapping is the cause.

Slightly convex and covered with decoration of a simple sort, this shield has a diameter of 30 to 60 centimeters, is brown in color (the smaller, very 28 common kind (Plate 12) is colored dark red), and is very durable. The Som\u00e2li often uses it as a parasol, especially when he is roaming idly through the treeless savanna. Usually, however, he keeps his shield in a cotton cover, and when on the march, he likes to hang it on his back. On his hip we find a sword-like bowie knife 45 to 65 centimeters long, with an iron cutting edge ( gulh\u00e1t, sejf, or bila\u00faa ) five centimeters wide usually, in a simple leather sheath. The handle is decorated with a tin covering and is made of wood or ivory. This knife is designed for defense in hand-to-hand fighting, but it is used for all the tasks in everyday life that require the use of a knife, especially woodworking, skinning animals, hut construction, and so forth. The Dan\u00e2kil manufacture especially attractive knives, beautifully hooked at the tip and unusually well decorated with a brass mounting. Many of these knives are to be found in \u00cajssa country. A small dagger or stiletto (m\u00edndi) is also used. The cutting edges are equal to the best European ones. In addition to the spear, everyone as a rule carries a powerful, long, club-like stick (\u00fasa) . This is being adopted more and more, especially in the towns of Berbera and Zeila which have very recently barred the entry of Som\u00e2l with weapons in their hands. Furthermore, cudgels a meter in length and richly carved (w\u00eager) are found on the coast. Two spears are carried by the men in the vicinity of the Galla region. No Som\u00e2li is seen without a spear, even when he is performing household tasks. When he walks, he usually carries it on the left shoulder or leans on it. The M\u00eddgan carries a bow (g\u00e1nso) and arrows (nis\u00e2b) . The bow is one and a half meters long and unadorned by carving or other decoration. The quiver (gub\u00e2jo), however, is adorned with an indented leather lid or leather tassels. The poison for the arrow (gedul\u00e2jo) is prepared from the roots of various poison trees, particularly the Cararo . It is deep black and adheres below the arrowhead (fil\u00e2r) . The poison acts rapidly, and the Som\u00e2l regard the falling out or shedding of hair as the first and most definite indication of the onset of complete poisoning. Members of the female sex carry no weapons. In battle, the spear is thrown only in the most extreme situations when one can then immediately hurl himself on the enemy with a knife. As a rule the Som\u00e2li carries out an attack by lying in ambush for the enemy and then knocking him down with the spear. The instrument of assassination otherwise is the bowie knife. The natives are not very skilled in the use of their weapons, especially the spears, which are thrown without verve.

Special priests (wodad\u00edn) roam through the countryside, usually traveling through a region with a number of other priests, performing the functions of their office and lining their pockets in the process. They have no influence whatever on the people. Superstition flourishes in the most luxuriant forms, but I would say that even this has no significance whatever, because the natives content themselves entirely with copied amulets and the like. Belief in sorceresses ( kom\u00e2ju, sorceress) is to be encountered here and there since, after all, every old woman is surrounded by the aura of being able to perform sorcery. The Som\u00e2li swears an oath (d\u00e2r) on the Koran, and the Ogad\u00ean on the head of his children and wives. Breach of promise with respect to the Whites or the enemy, however, is no crime. The prayer times are those of all Islamites (9:30, s\u00fabbeh; noon, d\u00f3hur; 3:30, \u00e1ssur; 6:30, m\u00e1grib; and eight o\u2019clock, as\u00e2 ); they are observed only by the most pious. Attempts to convert the Som\u00e2l to the Christian religion have never been seriously undertaken. In Zeila, to be sure, a magnificent house has been built for the French Mission, but not in the hope of being able to win the Som\u00e2l for Christendom. The building is supposed to serve merely as a way station for missionaries going off to Galla country. The universal complaint is that the Som\u00e2li curtly turns away the European apostle of the faith and that, in view of the people\u2019s nomadic way of life, the latter is unable to step in to civilize the natives by getting them in the habit of working regularly. None of the religious ideas of the Galla has been incorporated by the Som\u00e2l. Except to celebrate Ramadan there are no festive periods. I heard nothing about divine judgments among the western Som\u00e2l tribes. The times of year are mostly distinguished according to the rainy seasons in the manner already indicated, but between these there are also shorter periods ( bil, month) by which time is occasionally reckoned. Their names are not generally known ( 73 . The names of the months given by Haggenmacher, op. cit., p. 28, are not all known to the Ejssa, so I must assume that they are perhaps valid for only a small group of coastal inhabitants. The \u00cajssa and H\u00e1br Au\u00e1l use the following designations for the months: d\u00faggo (November), bil d\u00farroh h\u00f4ra (December), bil d\u00farroh d\u00e1mba (January), raj\u00e2l h\u00f4ra (February), raj\u00e2l d\u00e1ha (March), raj\u00e2l d\u00e1mba (April), s\u00e1boh (May), wa b\u00e1ris (June), sunk\u00e2t (July), sunf\u00fbr (August), sid at\u00e2l (September), ar\u00e1fo (October). ).", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1999, 1996, 4865, 2028, 4858, 14560, 2040, 6039, 1996, 2436, 1997, 14163, 22367, 11493, 1031, 3968, 1012, 1010, 14163, 9351, 17168, 1029, 1033, 1998, 24209, 17516, 2102, 1012, 2569, 8656, 1006, 24185, 14697, 2378, 1007, 25728, 2083, 1996, 10833, 1010, 2788, 7118, 2083, 1037, 2555, 2007, 1037, 2193, 1997, 2060, 8656, 1010, 4488, 1996, 4972, 1997, 2037, 2436, 1998, 14834, 2037, 10306, 1999, 1996, 2832, 1012, 2027, 2031, 2053, 3747, 3649, 2006, 1996, 2111, 1012, 3565, 16643, 3508, 24299, 2229, 1999, 1996, 2087, 28359, 29091, 2102, 3596, 1010, 2021, 1045, 2052, 2360, 2008, 2130, 2023, 2038, 2053, 7784, 3649, 1010, 2138, 1996, 12493, 4180, 3209, 4498, 2007, 15826, 25087, 2015, 1998, 1996, 2066, 1012, 6772, 1999, 2061, 19170, 25932, 1006, 12849, 2863, 9103, 1010, 2061, 19170, 8303, 1007, 2003, 2000, 2022, 8567, 2182, 1998, 2045, 2144, 1010, 2044, 2035, 1010, 2296, 2214, 2450, 2003, 5129, 2011, 1996, 15240, 1997, 2108, 2583, 2000, 4685, 2061, 19170, 2854, 1012, 1996, 16831, 8415, 2015, 2019, 11292, 1006, 18243, 1007, 2006, 1996, 12849, 5521, 1010, 1998, 1996, 13958, 9648, 2078, 2006, 1996, 2132, 1997, 2010, 2336, 1998, 10403, 1012, 12510, 1997, 4872, 2007, 4847, 2000, 1996, 12461, 2030, 1996, 4099, 1010, 2174, 1010, 2003, 2053, 4126, 1012, 1996, 7083, 2335, 2024, 2216, 1997, 2035, 7025, 7616, 1006, 1023, 1024, 2382, 1010, 4942, 4783, 2232, 1025, 11501, 1010, 2079, 24572, 1025, 1017, 1024, 2382, 1010, 4632, 3126, 1025, 1020, 1024, 2382, 1010, 23848, 3089, 2497, 1025, 1998, 2809, 1051, 1521, 5119, 1010, 17306, 1007, 1025, 2027, 2024, 5159, 2069, 2011, 1996, 2087, 25020, 1012, 4740, 2000, 10463, 1996, 2061, 9067, 2000, 1996, 3017, 4676, 2031, 2196, 2042, 5667, 10607, 1012, 1999, 27838, 11733, 1010, 2000, 2022, 2469, 1010, 1037, 12047, 2160, 2038, 2042, 2328, 2005, 1996, 2413, 3260, 1010, 2021, 2025, 1999, 1996, 3246, 1997, 2108, 2583, 2000, 2663, 1996, 2061, 9067, 2005, 4828, 10497, 5358, 1012, 1996, 2311, 2003, 4011, 2000, 3710, 6414, 2004, 1037, 2126, 2276, 2005, 11743, 2183, 2125, 2000, 26033, 2050, 2406, 1012, 1996, 5415, 12087, 2003, 2008, 1996, 16831, 20099, 2135, 4332, 2185, 1996, 2647, 20121, 1997, 1996, 4752, 1998, 2008, 1010, 1999, 3193, 1997, 1996, 2111, 1521, 1055, 21702, 2126, 1997, 2166, 1010, 1996, 3732, 2003, 4039, 2000, 3357, 1999, 2000, 2942, 4697, 1996, 12493, 2011, 2893, 2068, 1999, 1996, 10427, 1997, 2551, 5570, 1012, 3904, 1997, 1996, 3412, 4784, 1997, 1996, 26033, 2050, 2038, 2042, 5100, 2011, 1996, 2061, 9067, 1012, 3272, 2000, 8439, 14115, 7847, 2045, 2024, 2053, 17037, 3512, 6993, 1012, 1045, 2657, 2498, 2055, 7746, 26186, 2426, 1996, 2530, 2061, 9067, 6946, 1012, 1996, 2335, 1997, 2095, 2024, 3262, 5182, 2429, 2000, 1996, 16373, 3692, 1999, 1996, 5450, 2525, 5393, 1010, 2021, 2090, 2122, 2045, 2024, 2036, 7820, 6993, 1006, 12170, 2140, 1010, 3204, 1007, 2011, 2029, 2051, 2003, 5681, 29072, 2098, 1012, 2037, 3415, 2024, 2025, 3227, 2124, 1006, 6421, 1012, 1996, 3415, 1997, 1996, 2706, 2445, 2011, 5292, 13871, 2368, 22911, 5886, 1010, 6728, 1012, 25022, 2102, 1012, 1010, 1052, 1012, 2654, 1010, 2024, 2025, 2035, 2124, 2000, 1996, 1041, 22578, 3736, 1010, 102]}, {"score": 0.5389690399169922, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "All the other examples that I have seen are obviously worn primarily as amulets.

There is one who was born for the heart and eats it. There is one who was born for the liver and eats it. There is one who was born for the kidneys and eats them. The one who was born to govern eats the liver. One who is not able to spit against the scorpion eats the kidneys. One who is not able to spit against the sickness called sebbad eats the heart. It is our medicine. \u2018Heart is for me!\u2019 says the one who spits against the sebbad sickness and will not eat heart. Our Molkal people is thus. Our women do not eat the heart either. What thing is the scorpion? It is an animal that bites you while you walk on the ground. If that animal bites you, that man who does not eat the kidneys spits on you. And the discomfort (of the scorpion\u2019s bite) leaves you. For another the liver is illicit. What thing is the sebbad? It is a sickness that on some comes out of the cheek, and on others out of the sides and is fatal. It is a sore that does not heal. It comes out and then pus comes out.

The situation is a low and level spit of sand, which high tides make almost an island. There is no harbour: a vessel of 250 tons cannot approach within a mile of the landing-place; the open roadstead is exposed to the terrible north wind, and when gales blow from the west and south, it is almost unapproachable. Every ebb leaves a sandy flat, extending half a mile seaward from the town; the reefy anchorage is difficult of entrance after sunset, and the coralline bottom renders wading painful. The shape of this once celebrated town is a tolerably regular parallelogram, of which the long sides run from east to west. The walls, without guns or embrasures, are built, like the houses, of coralline rubble and mud, in places dilapidated. There are five gates. The Bab el Sahil and the Bab el Jadd (a new postern) open upon the sea from the northern wall. At the Ashurbara, in the southern part of the enceinte, the Bedouins encamp, and above it the governor holds his Durbar. The Bab Abd el Kadir derives its name from a saint buried outside and eastward of the city, and the Bab el Saghir is pierced in the western wall. The public edifices are six mosques, including the Jami, or cathedral, for Friday prayer: these buildings have queer little crenelles on whitewashed walls, and a kind of elevated summer-house to represent the minaret. Near one of them are remains of a circular Turkish Munar, manifestly of modern construction. There is no Mahkamah or Kazi\u2019s court: that dignitary transacts business at his own house, and the Festival prayers are recited near the Saint\u2019s Tomb outside the eastern gate. The northeast angle of the town is occupied by a large graveyard with the usual deleterious consequences. The climate of Zayla is cooler than that of Aden, and, the site being open all around, it is not so unhealthy. Much spare room is enclosed by the town walls: evaporation and Nature\u2019s scavengers act succedanea for sewerage. Zayla commands the adjacent harbour of Tajurrah, and is by position the northern port of Aussa (the ancient capital of Adel), of Harar, and of southern Abyssinia: the feuds of the rulers have, however, transferred the main trade to Berberah. It sends caravans northwards to the Dankali, and south-west-wards, through the Eesa and Gudabirsi tribes as far as Efat and Gurague. It is visited by Cafilas from Abyssinia, and the different races of Bedouins, extending from the hills to the seaboard. The exports are valuable\u2014slaves, ivory, hides, honey, antelope horns, clarified butter, and gums: the coast abounds in sponge, coral, and small pearls, which Arab divers collect in the fair season. In the harbour I found about twenty native craft, large and small: of these, ten belonged to the governor. They trade with Berberah, Arabia, and Western India, and are navigated by \u201cRajput\u201d or Hindu pilots. Provisions at Zayla are cheap; a family of six persons live well for about 30 l. per annum. The general food is mutton: a large sheep costs one dollar, a small one half the price; camels; meat, beef, and in winter kid, abound. Fish is rare, and fowls are not commonly eaten. Holcus, when dear, sells at forty pounds per dollar, at seventy pounds when cheap. It is usually levigated with slab and roller, and made into sour cakes. Some, however, prefer the Arab form \u201cbalilah,\u201d boiled and mixed with ghee. Wheat and rice are imported: the price varies from forty to sixty pounds the Riyal or dollar. Of the former grain the people make a sweet cake called Sabaya, resembling the Fatirah of Egypt: a favourite dish also is \u201charisah\u201d\u2014flesh, rice flour, and boiled wheat, all finely pounded and mixed together. Milk is not procurable during the hot weather; after rain every house is full of it; the Bedouins bring it in skins and sell it for a nominal sum. Besides a large floating population, Zayla contains about 1500 souls. They are comparatively a fine race of people, and suffer from little but fever and an occasional ophthalmia. Their greatest hardship is the want of the pure element: the Hissi or well, is about four miles distant from the town, and all the pits within the walls supply brackish or bitter water, fit only for external use. This is probably the reason why vegetables are unknown, and why a horse, a mule, or even a dog, is not to be found in the place. to one of his substantial houses of coralline and mud plastered over with glaring whitewash. The ground floor is a kind of warehouse full of bales and boxes, scales and buyers. A flight of steep steps leads into a long room with shutters to exclude the light, floored with tamped earth, full of \u201cevening flyers\u201d * \u201cFid-mer,\u201d or the evening flyer, is the Somali name for a bat. These little animals are not disturbed in houses, because they keep off flies and mosquitoes, the plagues of the Somali country. Flies abound in the very jungles wherever cows have been, and settle in swarms upon the traveller. Before the monsoon their bite is painful, especially that of the small green species; and there is a red variety called \u201cDiksi as,\u201d whose venom, according to the people, causes them to vomit. The latter abounds in Gulays and the hill ranges of the Berberah country: it is innocuous during the cold season. The mosquito bites bring on, according to the same authority, deadly fevers: the superstition probably arises from the fact that mosquitoes and fevers become formidable about the same time. , and destitute of furniture. Parallel to it are three smaller apartments; and above is a terraced roof, where they who fear not the dew and the land-breeze sleep. * Such a building at Zayla would cost at most 500 dollars. At Aden, 2000 rupees, or nearly double the sum, would be paid for a matted shed, which excludes neither sun, nor wind, nor rain. I found a room duly prepared; the ground was spread with mats, and cushions against the walls denoted the Divan: for me was placed a Kursi or cot, covered with fine Persian rugs and gaudy silk and satin pillows. The Hajj installed us with ceremony, and insisted, despite my remonstrances, upon occupying the floor whilst I sat on the raised seat.

Sometimes comes the Sayyid Mohammed el Barr, a stout personage, formerly governor of Zayla, and still highly respected by the people on acount of his pure pedigree. With him is the Fakih Adan, a savan of ignoble origin. * The system of caste, which prevails in El Yemen, though not in the northern parts of Arabia, is general throughout the Somali country. The principal families of outcasts are the following. The Yebir correspond with the Dushan of Southern Arabia: the males are usually jesters to the chiefs, and both sexes take certain parts at festivals, marriages, and circumcisions. The number is said to be small, amounting to about 100 families in the northern Somali country. The Tomal or Handad, the blacksmiths, originally of Aydur race, have become vile by intermarriage with serviles. They must now wed maidens of their own class, and live apart from the community: their magical practices are feared by the people, \u2014the connection of wits and witchcraft is obvious,\u2014and all private quarrels are traced to them. It has been observed that the blacksmith has ever been looked upon with awe by barbarians on the same principle that made Vulcan a deity. In Abyssinia all artisans are Budah, sorcerers, especially the blacksmith, and he is a social outcast as among the Somal; even in El Hejaz, a land, unlike Yemen, opposed to distinctions amongst Moslems, the Khalawiyah, who work in metal, are considered vile. Throughout the rest of El Islam the blacksmith is respected as treading in the path of David, the father of the craft. The word \u201cTomal,\u201d opposed to Somal, is indigenous. \u201cHandad\u201d is palpably a corruption of the Arabic \u201cHaddad,\u201d iron-worker. . The Midgan, \u201cone-hand,\u201d corresponds with the Khadim of Yemen: he is called Rami or \u201carcher\u201d by the Arabs. There are three distinct tribes of this people, who are numerous in the Somali country: the best genealogists cannot trace their origin, though some are silly enough to derive them, like the Akhdam, from Shimr. All, however, agree in expelling the Midgan from the gentle blood of Somali land, and his position has been compared to that of Freedman amongst the Romans. These people take service under the different chiefs, who sometimes entertain great numbers to aid in forays and frays; they do not, however, confine themselves to one craft. Many Midgans employ themselves in hunting and agriculture. Instead of spear and shield, they carry bows and a quiver full of diminutive arrows, barbed and poisoned with the Waba,\u2014a weapon used from Faizoghli to the Cape of Good Hope. Like the Veddah of Ceylon, the Midgan is a poor shot, and scarcely strong enough to draw his stiff bow. He is accused of maliciousness; and the twanging of his string will put to flight a whole village. The poison is greatly feared: it causes, say the people, the hair and nails to drop off, and kills a man in half an hour. The only treatment known is instant excision of the part; and this is done the more frequently, because here, as in other parts of Africa, such stigmates are deemed ornamental. In appearance the Midgan is dark and somewhat stunted; he is known to the people by peculiarities of countenance and accent. When they appear the conversation becomes intensely intellectual: sometimes we dispute religion, sometimes politics, at others history and other humanities.

They rest but little \u2014 from 11 P.M. till dawn \u2014 and never sleep in the bush, for fear of plundering parties. Few begin the day with prayer as Moslems should: for the most part they apply themselves to counting and milking their cattle. The animals, all of which have namest ** For instance, Anfarr, the \u201cSpotted;\u201d Tarren, \u201cWheatflour;\u201d &c. &c. , come when called to the pail, and supply the family with a morning meal. Then the warriors, grasping their spears, and sometimes the young women armed only with staves, drive their herds to pasture: the matrons and children, spinning or rope-making, tend the flocks, and the kraal is abandoned to the very young, the old, and the sick. The herdsmen wander about, watching the cattle and tasting nothing but the pure element or a pinch of coarse tobacco. Sometimes they play at Shahh, Shantarah, and other games, of which they are passionately fond: with a board formed of lines traced in the sand, and bits of dry wood or camel\u2019s earth acting pieces, they spend hour after hour, every looker-on vociferating his opinion, and catching at the men, till apparently the two players are those least interested in the game. Or, to drive off sleep, they sit whistling to their flocks, or they perform upon the Forimo, a reed pipe generally made at Harar, which has a plaintive sound uncommonly pleasing. * It is used by the northern people, the Abyssinians, Gallas, Adail, Eesa and Gudabirsi; the southern Somal ignore it. In the evening, the kraal again resounds with lowing and bleating: the camel\u2019s milk is all drunk, the cow\u2019s and goat\u2019s reserved for butter and ghee, which the women prepare; the numbers are once more counted, and the animals are carefully penned up for the night. This simple life is varied by an occasional birth and marriage, dance and foray, disease and murder. Their maladies are few and simple ** The most dangerous disease is small-pox, which history traces to Eastern Abyssinia, where it still becomes at times a violent epidemic, sweeping off its thousands. The patient, if a man of note, is placed upon the sand, and fed with rice or millet bread till he recovers or dies. The chicken-pox kills many infants; they are treated by bathing in the fresh blood of a sheep, covered with the skin, and exposed to the sun. Smoke and glare, dirt and flies, cold winds and naked extremities, cause ophthalmia, especially in the hills; this disease rarely blinds any save the citizens, and no remedy is known. Dysentery is cured by rice and sour milk, patients also drink clarified cow\u2019s butter; and in bad cases the stomach is cauterized, fire and disease, according to the Somal, never coexisting. Haemorroids, when dry, are reduced by a stick used as a bougie and allowed to remain in loco all night. Sometimes the part affected is cupped with a horn and knife, or a leech performs excision. The diet is camels\u2019 or goats\u2019 flesh and milk; clarified butter and Bussorah dates \u2014 rice and mutton are carefully avoided. For a certain local disease, they use senna or colocynth, anoint the body with sulphur boiled in ghee, and expose it to the sun,M41:P41 or they leave the patient all night in the dew; \u2014 abstinence and perspiration generally effect a cure. For the minor form, the afflicted drink the melted fat of a sheep\u2019s tail. Consumption is a family complaint, and therefore considered incurable; to use the Somali expression, they address the patient with \u201cAllah, have mercy upon thee!\u201d not with \u201cAllah cure thee!\u201d There are leeches who have secret simples for curing wounds. Generally the blood is squeezed out, the place is washed with water, the lips are sewn up and a dressing of astringent leaves is applied. They have splints for fractures, and they can reduce dislocations. A medical friend at Aden partially dislocated his knee, which half-a-dozen of the faculty insisted upon treating as a sprain. Of all his tortures none was more severe than that inflicted by my Somali visitors. They would look at him, distinguish the complaint, ask him how long he had been invalided, and hearing the reply \u2014 four months \u2014 would break into exclamations of wonder. \u201cIn our country,\u201d they cried, \u201cwhen a man falls, two pull his body and two his legs, then they tie sticks round it, give him plenty of camel\u2019s milk, and he is well in a month;\u201d a speech which made friend S. groan in spirit. Firing and clarified butter are the farrier\u2019s panaceas. Camels are cured by sheep\u2019s head broth, asses by chopping one ear, mules by cutting off the tail, and horses by ghee or a drench of melted fat. parrot.

Yet there is a spirit-possession disease known as wadaaddo (plural of wadaad ) particularly prevalent in the north-east of Somaliland. The disease is sometimes diagnosed in people suffering from tuberculosis or pneumonia and the general symptoms are coughing, sneezing, and vomiting with occasional lapses into unconsciousness. This ailment is treated by wadaads, particularly those who have previously suffered from it, who adjure the spirit to quit the patient by reading potent verses of the Quran and bathing him with perfume. Perfume in Somaliland has a ritual significance and is associated with religious celebrations. Frequently on Fridays when men are holding a religious ceremony perfume is poured liberally over the hands of those taking part.  These wadaads of the spirit world were, it is believed, formerly the familiars of Boqor \u2018Ismaan, Sultan of the Majeerteen \u2018Ismaan Mahamuud; and when he died are said to have been released to trouble people. The disease appears to have spread westwards only within the last fifteen years or so and is not very common.

The previous chapter gave another example of the power of the unknown as it was seen how symbols of Islamic mysticism are used to describe non-agnatic aspects of personhood.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 3568, 1010, 2023, 8993, 2046, 1996, 2373, 1997, 16831, 20233, 2003, 11211, 2007, 2019, 4106, 1997, 9594, 11510, 13120, 2015, 1997, 1996, 4696, 1997, 1996, 4326, 1998, 1996, 4242, 1012, 2023, 4106, 2097, 2036, 8328, 2070, 2582, 2422, 2006, 1996, 13818, 2000, 1996, 4233, 2372, 1997, 1996, 6338, 1012, 2445, 2008, 1996, 3484, 1997, 9594, 11510, 7634, 4397, 4233, 2372, 2004, 7495, 2000, 1037, 9280, 4795, 4696, 1997, 1523, 12358, 1524, 1006, 11895, 4095, 4402, 6672, 1007, 1010, 2009, 2003, 7882, 2000, 3198, 2129, 2008, 4696, 2003, 3421, 1998, 10959, 2306, 1996, 2088, 3193, 1997, 9594, 11510, 1012, 1996, 16831, 21951, 1997, 2054, 17367, 2019, 4621, 4200, 2024, 2025, 2981, 2013, 1996, 4216, 2005, 2060, 3596, 1997, 2373, 1012, 2004, 4572, 1006, 3699, 1025, 3551, 1025, 3411, 1025, 3069, 2050, 1024, 2753, 1011, 5786, 1007, 2038, 5275, 1010, 1996, 17529, 2749, 3378, 2007, 14286, 15965, 2967, 2064, 2022, 2464, 2004, 18588, 2000, 1996, 2512, 1011, 10644, 2373, 1997, 6586, 1998, 1996, 4795, 1523, 2373, 1997, 1996, 5410, 1524, 1010, 1045, 1012, 1041, 2967, 11158, 2019, 2058, 2102, 2591, 2373, 4225, 1999, 12943, 19833, 2594, 3408, 1012, 1996, 3025, 3127, 2435, 2178, 2742, 1997, 1996, 2373, 1997, 1996, 4242, 2004, 2009, 2001, 2464, 2129, 9255, 1997, 5499, 17477, 2964, 2024, 2109, 2000, 6235, 2512, 1011, 12943, 19833, 2594, 5919, 1997, 2711, 9021, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9441044926643372, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Geed, medical trees, is a general term for trees, bushes and some herbs.

It is often demonstrated that African medical therapy looks at the whole of the patient and his social situation. An abnormal symptom is referred back to social relations in the immediate environment and the therapy is aimed at restoring these relations to a normal condition (see e.g. Ayoade 1979; Conco 1979; Dawson 1979). Famous, too, is Evans-Pritchard\u2019s example of how the Zande choose to regard only domestic plants as materia medica (1937: 448). Even where this may not be directly the case, healing is \u201cin any event, organically bound up with basic political and economic processes\u201d (Feierman 1985:116), thus echoing what the same author calls \u201cthe social roots of health and healing\u201d. Certainly such trends can also be traced in Somali medical practices, but as we have seen here a dominant trend is not to seek for remedies in the familiar and mundane. 9 . Some such techniques that seek to relate the affliction of the person to social relational problems seem to be less concerned with the healing as such and are better thought of as \u201cdivination\u201d. This applies to, for instance, the fal or soothsaying (cf. fallow, \u201csoothsayer\u201d) which is obviously what Antoniotti has in mind when he writes \u201cat the beginning of every therapy, the sick person must recognize the source of the illness\u201d (1984:160).

Significantly, Tresalti reports from a village in southern Somalia that the absence of privacy at modern clinics inhibits many people from choosing that type of therapy (1984:205).

The duur (bush) is both the domain of wild animals and of health restoring plants. Plants themselves can be used for malicious as well as healing purposes.

The extreme symptoms are frenzy, fits, or madness, and the spirit itself is, in the Islamic setting, described as a kind of jinn whose malignant powers cause certain types of sickness. Among the eastern tribes of northern Somaliland \u2018invisible\u2019 wadaad (see above) act similarly to saar but have less serious effects and are merely responsible for some minor forms of illness. Saar can be expelled by persons who have acquired mastery over the spirits through having themselves been previously possessed. In northern Somaliland such \u2018doctors\u2019 ( alaqa ) are generally women, for visitation is here confined almost exclusively to this sex, especially to the wealthy. Rich women who believe that a saar is troubling them have recourse to an alaqa: poor women cannot afford to be afflicted by saar because treatment is costly. Such an illogical situation leads sceptical Somalis to abandon their belief in saar . This is not the place nor is there at present sufficient material on the social contexts in which saar are active, to enter into a sociological discussion of the subject. It seems possible, however, that we are concerned with a form of the witchcraft which is associated with wealth and polygamy elsewhere and which serves as a vehicle for jealousy and as a buttress of social status. Saar are expelled in the \u2018dance of the saar \u2019 which is apparently fairly extensively practised in Somalia although violently opposed by Muslim wadaad . In northern Somaliland, where official opposition is such that many devout Muslims deny its existence, 1 In fact in 1955 the British Somaliland Protectorate Advisory Council unanimously agreed that legislation should be introduced to make the practice of saar rites illegal. War Somali Sidihi, No. 60, 23 April 1955. the dance is sometimes still performed by women. It seems that the dance acts as a form of exorcism of the malevolent jinn causing possession, and perhaps less frequently as a means of attaining possession. In Somalia, the opening movement is called or-goys and consists of those assembled beginning to sing and to raise their arms rhythmically towards the sky. Soon someone falls in a faint and his companions \u2018beat the saar \u2019, forming a circle round him and breaking into \u2018the song of the saar \u2019, sung at first slowly and then with increasing tempo. Drumming, castanet-playing, and handclapping swell the singing. Slowly the fallen dancer revives, and moving his limbs in rhythm, seizes a knife or lighted brand which he thrusts between his teeth and dances into the semi-circle formed by the others. The tempo increases until the dancer again succumbs and falls panting to the ground. After a little he rises completely restored and the saar is said to have left him. 2 Among the Cushitic Agao of Gondar in northern Ethiopia, the refractions of the Sky God ( Zar ) which possess people are called zar, are associated especially but not exclusively with women, are inherited in the family, and have genealogies corresponding to their territorial distribution (Leiris, 1934 (1), 134, 126). The dance is widely distributed among the Cushitic peoples of north-east Africa and often the possessed dancer acts as an oracle 3 The After (Danakil) of southern Eritrea and of Ethiopia have a similar ceremony in which the possessed dancer is called jenile (jinn?) . See Licata, 1885, 267; Thesiger, 1935, 8. (see Leiris, 1934). Beyond the Cushitic areas, it occurs as far away as Egypt (Kahle, 1912), the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (Trimingham, 1949, pp. 174-7), and even the Hijaz (Hurgronje, 1888-9, II, pp. 124-8). The explanation seems to be that the saar (Zar) dance has spread far beyond the bounds of Cushitic culture with the export of slaves from Ethiopia where it has its Cushitic origin (Cerulli, 1933, II, p. 35).", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 7842, 2906, 1999, 16831, 5577, 1037, 2110, 1997, 6664, 2011, 1037, 4382, 2036, 2170, 7842, 2906, 1012, 1996, 6034, 8030, 2024, 21517, 1010, 16142, 1010, 2030, 12013, 1010, 1998, 1996, 4382, 2993, 2003, 1010, 1999, 1996, 5499, 4292, 1010, 2649, 2004, 1037, 2785, 1997, 9743, 2078, 3005, 16007, 27881, 4204, 3426, 3056, 4127, 1997, 15556, 1012, 2426, 1996, 2789, 6946, 1997, 2642, 16831, 3122, 1520, 8841, 1521, 11333, 2850, 4215, 1006, 2156, 2682, 1007, 2552, 6660, 2000, 7842, 2906, 2021, 2031, 2625, 3809, 3896, 1998, 2024, 6414, 3625, 2005, 2070, 3576, 3596, 1997, 7355, 1012, 7842, 2906, 2064, 2022, 10016, 2011, 5381, 2040, 2031, 3734, 26364, 2058, 1996, 8633, 2083, 2383, 3209, 2042, 3130, 8679, 1012, 1999, 2642, 16831, 3122, 2107, 1520, 7435, 1521, 1006, 21862, 19062, 1007, 2024, 3227, 2308, 1010, 2005, 28877, 2003, 2182, 12302, 2471, 7580, 2000, 2023, 3348, 1010, 2926, 2000, 1996, 7272, 1012, 4138, 2308, 2040, 2903, 2008, 1037, 7842, 2906, 2003, 19817, 7140, 9709, 2068, 2031, 28667, 22957, 2063, 2000, 2019, 21862, 19062, 1024, 3532, 2308, 3685, 8984, 2000, 2022, 21358, 29301, 2098, 2011, 7842, 2906, 2138, 3949, 2003, 17047, 1012, 2107, 2019, 5665, 20734, 3663, 5260, 8040, 23606, 7476, 16831, 2015, 2000, 10824, 2037, 6772, 1999, 7842, 2906, 1012, 2023, 2003, 2025, 1996, 2173, 4496, 2003, 2045, 2012, 2556, 7182, 3430, 2006, 1996, 2591, 18046, 1999, 2029, 7842, 2906, 2024, 3161, 1010, 2000, 4607, 2046, 1037, 24846, 6594, 1997, 1996, 3395, 1012, 2009, 3849, 2825, 1010, 2174, 1010, 2008, 2057, 2024, 4986, 2007, 1037, 2433, 1997, 1996, 21599, 2029, 2003, 3378, 2007, 7177, 1998, 26572, 22864, 2100, 6974, 1998, 2029, 4240, 2004, 1037, 4316, 2005, 14225, 1998, 2004, 1037, 10007, 8303, 1997, 2591, 3570, 1012, 7842, 2906, 2024, 10016, 1999, 1996, 1520, 3153, 1997, 1996, 7842, 2906, 1521, 2029, 2003, 4593, 7199, 8077, 20439, 1999, 14717, 2348, 14196, 4941, 2011, 5152, 11333, 2850, 4215, 1012, 1999, 2642, 16831, 3122, 1010, 2073, 2880, 4559, 2003, 2107, 2008, 2116, 26092, 7486, 9772, 2049, 4598, 1010, 1015, 1999, 2755, 1999, 3982, 1996, 2329, 16831, 3122, 20394, 7319, 2473, 15645, 3530, 2008, 6094, 2323, 2022, 3107, 2000, 2191, 1996, 3218, 1997, 7842, 2906, 17105, 6206, 1012, 2162, 16831, 15765, 19190, 2072, 1010, 2053, 1012, 3438, 1010, 2603, 2258, 3982, 1012, 1996, 3153, 2003, 2823, 2145, 2864, 2011, 2308, 1012, 2009, 3849, 2008, 1996, 3153, 4490, 2004, 1037, 2433, 1997, 4654, 2953, 22987, 2213, 1997, 1996, 3287, 6767, 16136, 9743, 2078, 4786, 6664, 1010, 1998, 3383, 2625, 4703, 2004, 1037, 2965, 1997, 26615, 6664, 1012, 1999, 14717, 1010, 1996, 3098, 2929, 2003, 2170, 2030, 1011, 2175, 7274, 1998, 3774, 1997, 2216, 9240, 2927, 2000, 6170, 1998, 2000, 5333, 2037, 2608, 14797, 3973, 2875, 1996, 3712, 1012, 2574, 2619, 4212, 1999, 1037, 8143, 1998, 2010, 11946, 1520, 3786, 1996, 7842, 2906, 1521, 1010, 5716, 1037, 4418, 2461, 2032, 1998, 4911, 2046, 1520, 1996, 2299, 1997, 1996, 7842, 2906, 1521, 1010, 7042, 2012, 2034, 3254, 1998, 2059, 2007, 4852, 13657, 1012, 22980, 1010, 3459, 7231, 2102, 1011, 2652, 1010, 1998, 2192, 20464, 29098, 2075, 18370, 1996, 4823, 1012, 3254, 1996, 102]}, {"score": 0.9619161486625671, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "The realm of the Sky God includes a multitude of subsidiary spirits; the spirits of the bush, certain animals, some snakes, scorpions, termites, and other insects frequently credited by Somali with malignant powers. In certain situations tribes are described as linked to trees and animals which are addressed by maternal kinship names, but the connexion does not appear to be totemic. Spirit-refractions are said to have their seats in those possessed, and, among the Cushitic Agao of Gondar in Ethiopia the spirit-ridden subject is referred to as the spirit\u2019s \u2018horse\u2019. A similar spirit is encountered and overcome in the crossing the threshold ceremony ( kalaqaad ) which marks a male child\u2019s first expedition outside his mother\u2019s hut. The baby is carried over the threshold by his mother\u2019s brother (Cerulli, 1919, p. 23). Although generally obscured by and syncreted in Islam, divining and various forms of sympathetic magic are still practised. Ordeals and oath-taking by swearing on stones are used to establish testimony. Charms and amulets, especially as prophylactics, enjoy wide popularity. Their efficacy, now, of course, depends upon association with the Holy Koran. In this context it is perhaps not irrelevant to mention the fire-kindling ceremony of dobshid which is widely observed and marks the commencement of the solar year. 1 See Lewis, 1955, 62.

In Muslim theology, angels, pre-eminent amongst whom is Gabriel, generally figure as Divine Messengers created by God to serve and worship Him. They are charged with recording man\u2019s actions in this life, receiving his soul in heaven, and acting as his counsel on the day of judgment. On the other hand, jinn are those rebellious spirits created similarly to man, but of fire in place of earth, and committed to Solomon\u2019s keeping, who seek to lead man astray and to subvert the teachings of the prophets. It is as jinn that the majority of pre-Islamic spirits previously associated with Waaq are assimilated in Islam. This is illustrated in the following tale current among the Gasar Gudda tribe of Somalia. \u2018Solomon, son of David, on whom be peace, commanded all men, all the animals, the wind, spirits, and demons, the entire kingdom of the Great King. One day the jinn were at work as usual, and Solomon, leaning against a tree, seemed to be watching them although he gave no sign of repose. Solomon was dead, but remained supported by the tree while the jinn unaware of what had happened went on with their work. At last the termites succeeded in eating their way through Solomon\u2019s support precipitating him heavily on to the ground. The jinn quickly ran to the spot and saw that the son of David was dead. They began to rejoice for now they could stop working since their master was dead. They hastened to the termites and made a pact with them, saying, \u201cYou make your nest of earth and we will bring the water for its strengthening\u201d. From this time forth jinn and termites are in alliance\u2019 (Ferrandi, 1903, p. 309). Here within Islam the spirits attendant upon the mysterious construction of termite mounds are associated with jinn in Solomon\u2019s keeping. The relation \u2018spirits\u2014termites\u2019 is given Muslim sanction in Solomon\u2019s authority over jinn . Similarly the source of the efficacy of divination, ordeals, charms, and prophylactic amulets has been transferred from Waaq to Allah when beneficent and to jinn when mischievous or evil. Now the favourite amulet is the Sufi rosary ( tusbah ) whose 99 beads remind the believer of the innumerable praise-names of Allah and help him to perform his prayer-tasks. Perhaps equally popular as amulets are small leather pouches armed with inscriptions from the Koran. Thus phenomena which formerly owed their power to some connexion with Waaq now originate in Allah, the ultimate source of all power. 1 cf. the fate of the pre-Islamic Gods and spirits in Arabia, Koran, Sura XXXVII. For general indications of the universality of such syncretisms in Islam, see Gibb, 1947, 23 ff.; Miliot, 1949, 643. Saar spirits are described by Somali as a kind of jinn . The whole spirit hierarchy of Waaq is being progressively Islamized. This is a process which naturally also applies to God\u2019s attributes. Among the Gasar Gudda, again, the rainbow, from being the Sky God\u2019s belt, has become the path good souls take to heaven, although it is also contended by some to be the smoke made by rain falling upon termite hills. Rain-drops are believed to turn into angels (an understandable evaluation); thunder ( uri ) is the voice of angels ( malaika ) or the noise of their combat in striving to stop rain. Lightning ( birk ) darts forth from the armpits of melek Mikail, the archangel Michael. 1 Ferrandi, 1903, 298 ff. Michael ( Sura, II) appears thus to be taken as a symbol of war.

Throughout her marriage she is expected to obey, honour, and respect her spouse, and to be particularly scrupulous in this regard in the early years of marriage. Immediately after the wedding her subordination to her husband is emphasised in the traditional beating which her husband administers on the wedding night with a ceremonial whip ( jeedal ). In practice this instrument is rarely seen today, but is said to have been proudly carried by all newly married husbands in the past as a sign of their new marital authority. Today the bride may receive no more than a token cuffing. Other gestures of submission are expected by the husband. His bride should remove his sandals on the wedding night and in the early days of marriage. In contrast to their own exuberance, men even regard the pain which a bride experiences on her first nights of intercourse through the opening and enlargement of the infibulated vulva as a further expression of male virility and female submission. 1 . Men sometimes boas! that their virility is such that they can, unaided, force an opening in the infibulated vulva. Generally, however, the bride\u2019s mother, or if the marriage is celebrated at the husband\u2019s home, his mother, opens the vulva with a small knife. This is said to be something that amother readily does for her daughter as the wishes to make everything \u2018smooth\u2019 for the couple. Sometimes, however, the incision is made by a woman of the despised occupational group who, amongst other things, specialise in infibulation. There is no doubt that in the early weeks of a first marriage most women experience much pain. In addition, the forced removal of a bride to her marriage hut by her husband\u2019s friends, which is reported to take place in some weddings, although I have not witnessed it, can be seen to emphasise the dominant role of the man and the subservient, even captive, status of the woman. 2 . Cerulli who reports this amongst the Majeerteen argues from it to a former state of marriage by capture (Cerulli, 1919, p. 73). But as far as I know, there is no sound evidence to suggest that marriage by capture was ever a general process in northern Somaliland.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2000, 1037, 6196, 6698, 3510, 20362, 1037, 2450, 2013, 2014, 2269, 1521, 1055, 7191, 3691, 1998, 3182, 2014, 2104, 2008, 1997, 2014, 3129, 1012, 2802, 2014, 3510, 2016, 2003, 3517, 2000, 15470, 1010, 6225, 1010, 1998, 4847, 2014, 18591, 1010, 1998, 2000, 2022, 3391, 8040, 21531, 16203, 1999, 2023, 7634, 1999, 1996, 2220, 2086, 1997, 3510, 1012, 3202, 2044, 1996, 5030, 2014, 4942, 8551, 12758, 2000, 2014, 3129, 2003, 7902, 2098, 1999, 1996, 3151, 6012, 2029, 2014, 3129, 21497, 2015, 2006, 1996, 5030, 2305, 2007, 1037, 12961, 11473, 1006, 15333, 11960, 2140, 1007, 1012, 1999, 3218, 2023, 6602, 2003, 6524, 2464, 2651, 1010, 2021, 2003, 2056, 2000, 2031, 2042, 18067, 3344, 2011, 2035, 4397, 2496, 19089, 1999, 1996, 2627, 2004, 1037, 3696, 1997, 2037, 2047, 23143, 3691, 1012, 2651, 1996, 8959, 2089, 4374, 2053, 2062, 2084, 1037, 19204, 26450, 2075, 1012, 2060, 18327, 1997, 12339, 2024, 3517, 2011, 1996, 3129, 1012, 2010, 8959, 2323, 6366, 2010, 24617, 2006, 1996, 5030, 2305, 1998, 1999, 1996, 2220, 2420, 1997, 3510, 1012, 1999, 5688, 2000, 2037, 2219, 4654, 21436, 6651, 1010, 2273, 2130, 7634, 1996, 3255, 2029, 1037, 8959, 6322, 2006, 2014, 2034, 6385, 1997, 23198, 2083, 1996, 3098, 1998, 4372, 8017, 20511, 1997, 1996, 1999, 8873, 28507, 3064, 24728, 22144, 2004, 1037, 2582, 3670, 1997, 3287, 6819, 15928, 3012, 1998, 2931, 12339, 1012, 1015, 1012, 2273, 2823, 8945, 3022, 999, 2008, 2037, 6819, 15928, 3012, 2003, 2107, 2008, 2027, 2064, 1010, 14477, 14097, 1010, 2486, 2019, 3098, 1999, 1996, 1999, 8873, 28507, 3064, 24728, 22144, 1012, 3227, 1010, 2174, 1010, 1996, 8959, 1521, 1055, 2388, 1010, 2030, 2065, 1996, 3510, 2003, 6334, 2012, 1996, 3129, 1521, 1055, 2188, 1010, 2010, 2388, 1010, 7480, 1996, 24728, 22144, 2007, 1037, 2235, 5442, 1012, 2023, 2003, 2056, 2000, 2022, 2242, 2008, 2572, 14573, 2121, 12192, 2515, 2005, 2014, 2684, 2004, 1996, 8996, 2000, 2191, 2673, 1520, 5744, 1521, 2005, 1996, 3232, 1012, 2823, 1010, 2174, 1010, 1996, 4297, 19969, 2003, 2081, 2011, 1037, 2450, 1997, 1996, 26626, 16928, 2177, 2040, 1010, 5921, 2060, 2477, 1010, 2569, 5562, 1999, 1999, 8873, 28507, 3508, 1012, 2045, 2003, 2053, 4797, 2008, 1999, 1996, 2220, 3134, 1997, 1037, 2034, 3510, 2087, 2308, 3325, 2172, 3255, 1012, 1999, 2804, 1010, 1996, 3140, 8208, 1997, 1037, 8959, 2000, 2014, 3510, 12570, 2011, 2014, 3129, 1521, 1055, 2814, 1010, 2029, 2003, 2988, 2000, 2202, 2173, 1999, 2070, 20429, 1010, 2348, 1045, 2031, 2025, 9741, 2009, 1010, 2064, 2022, 2464, 2000, 7902, 2063, 1996, 7444, 2535, 1997, 1996, 2158, 1998, 1996, 4942, 8043, 13469, 3372, 1010, 2130, 12481, 1010, 3570, 1997, 1996, 2450, 1012, 1016, 1012, 8292, 6820, 6894, 2040, 4311, 2023, 5921, 1996, 16686, 11510, 17389, 2078, 9251, 2013, 2009, 2000, 1037, 2280, 2110, 1997, 3510, 2011, 5425, 1006, 8292, 6820, 6894, 1010, 4529, 1010, 1052, 1012, 6421, 1007, 1012, 2021, 2004, 2521, 2004, 1045, 2113, 1010, 2045, 2003, 2053, 2614, 3350, 2000, 6592, 2008, 3510, 2011, 5425, 2001, 2412, 1037, 2236, 2832, 1999, 2642, 16831, 3122, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.8400884866714478, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "Clothing is simple.

They cause falling stars and illness, can predict future events, but above all claim the prerogative as to various kinds of food, which unauthorized mortals consume under pain of sickness and death. The bope possesses a bari and eats the dishes in question with the bari's mouth. These spirits also appear in dreams and reveal the future, but they take no interest in the social life of the Indians and do not in any significant way figure in any myth. A bari becomes such through visitations of a bope. He must scrupulously observe the rules laid down to him on pain of loss of power and catching an incurable disease. However, the bope may render him invulnerable and give him the power to hunt game in the guise of a jaguar. The bari may inflict disease and death, but also cures and confers other benefits on the tribe. A client will offer him a cigar, whereupon the shaman calls on the bope, a number of whom led by a spokesman then possess him. In doctoring, the bari smokes the cigar, then the spokesman of the spirits asks why they have been called. One present explains, then the doctor sucks the afflicted parts, expectorating the putative cause, e. g., a beetle, which he scans, announcing his prognosis. Certain feminine diseases, however, he must not attempt treating lest he impair his supernatural powers. Most important of the bari's functions is the \u201cconsecration\u201d of the food reserved to the bope--a procedure that ensures to himself the choicest morsels.

Before our eyes were a beautiful beach and the majestic river. We lay down, very tired, on that white and soft sand and rested a little ... The sun was about to set ... We needed to think of wood for the night fire ... It was probable that some ounce would want to pay us an unwanted visit: the fire would protect us and give us the coals for roasting the fish. We told the Indians that they should immediately take care of the fishing: they were masters at that; we would go to look for firewood... So it was done: our job was very easy: firewood is not lacking in the thicket; we piled up enough and afterwards remained watching the Indians with their lines cast into the dark-green waters of the river ... By the movement of the lines, held surely in the Indians' hands, one could see perfectly that the fish were abundant and that they were biting constantly. In those moments the superattention of the sylvicolists was remarkable ... Suddenly, a line becomes taut; the Indian, alert, gives the pull of a master; the fish is caught on the hook. The savage makes a Herculean effort to conquer the resistance which the fish puts up against being brought to the surface. All of us, curious, were waiting for the last pull which would put the fish on dry land ... At the instant when the flattened head of the fish emerged a few meters from the beach, the Indian, unexpectedly, lets go of the line, makes a jump backwards, turns his back to the river, runs a few 118 cont. steps in toward the beach, and remains motionless, covering his face with his hands ... The scene was so fast that, when we saw it, everything had already happened: the fish had gone away with the entire line. The other Indians gathered up their fishhooks, which they had in their hands, and, without saying a word, went to lie down near the fire. Disturbed, even more impressed by what we had witnessed, we asked the why of such great and harmful extravagance. After a few moments, as if not to seem ill-mannered, they answered quite low, barely to be heard: \u201c bope (spirit of the evil) Kidokia, pirarara (smooth-skinned fish of the nature of the ja\u00fa /Paulicea lutkeni/. These two words were sufficient to explain everything, and we did not inquire any further. Kidokia is a forbidden fish, it is the food reserved for the bope , the most vengeful of the evil spirits and the chief of all. Woe to the bor\u00f3ro who would have dared to pull such a fish from the waters! The spirit of evil would have punished him with sickness and death. As much as we insisted that they try fishing anew, it was impossible to convince them: they remained hungry and did not even want to drink water; such was the dread that seized them. We, however, did not abandon at least killing our thirst; as for the rest, we had to resign ourselves to our bad fate. We lay 119 down beside the fire, near the Indians, hoping for better luck the next day.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2057, 2633, 3369, 1012, 2077, 2256, 2159, 2020, 1037, 3376, 3509, 1998, 1996, 22337, 2314, 1012, 2057, 3913, 2091, 1010, 2200, 5458, 1010, 2006, 2008, 2317, 1998, 3730, 5472, 1998, 8614, 1037, 2210, 1012, 1012, 1012, 1996, 3103, 2001, 2055, 2000, 2275, 1012, 1012, 1012, 2057, 2734, 2000, 2228, 1997, 3536, 2005, 1996, 2305, 2543, 1012, 1012, 1012, 2009, 2001, 15596, 2008, 2070, 19471, 2052, 2215, 2000, 3477, 2149, 2019, 18162, 3942, 1024, 1996, 2543, 2052, 4047, 2149, 1998, 2507, 2149, 1996, 5317, 2015, 2005, 25043, 2075, 1996, 3869, 1012, 2057, 2409, 1996, 6505, 2008, 2027, 2323, 3202, 2202, 2729, 1997, 1996, 5645, 1024, 2027, 2020, 5972, 2012, 2008, 1025, 2057, 2052, 2175, 2000, 2298, 2005, 2543, 3702, 1012, 1012, 1012, 2061, 2009, 2001, 2589, 1024, 2256, 3105, 2001, 2200, 3733, 1024, 2543, 3702, 2003, 2025, 11158, 1999, 1996, 4317, 3388, 1025, 2057, 17835, 2039, 2438, 1998, 5728, 2815, 3666, 1996, 6505, 2007, 2037, 3210, 3459, 2046, 1996, 2601, 1011, 2665, 5380, 1997, 1996, 2314, 1012, 1012, 1012, 2011, 1996, 2929, 1997, 1996, 3210, 1010, 2218, 7543, 1999, 1996, 6505, 1005, 2398, 1010, 2028, 2071, 2156, 6669, 2008, 1996, 3869, 2020, 12990, 1998, 2008, 2027, 2020, 12344, 7887, 1012, 1999, 2216, 5312, 1996, 3565, 19321, 4765, 3258, 1997, 1996, 25353, 2140, 7903, 20872, 3215, 2001, 9487, 1012, 1012, 1012, 3402, 1010, 1037, 2240, 4150, 21642, 1025, 1996, 2796, 1010, 9499, 1010, 3957, 1996, 4139, 1997, 1037, 3040, 1025, 1996, 3869, 2003, 3236, 2006, 1996, 8103, 1012, 1996, 9576, 3084, 1037, 2014, 21225, 2319, 3947, 2000, 16152, 1996, 5012, 2029, 1996, 3869, 8509, 2039, 2114, 2108, 2716, 2000, 1996, 3302, 1012, 2035, 1997, 2149, 1010, 8025, 1010, 2020, 3403, 2005, 1996, 2197, 4139, 2029, 2052, 2404, 1996, 3869, 2006, 4318, 2455, 1012, 1012, 1012, 2012, 1996, 7107, 2043, 1996, 16379, 2132, 1997, 1996, 3869, 6003, 1037, 2261, 5563, 2013, 1996, 3509, 1010, 1996, 2796, 1010, 14153, 1010, 11082, 2175, 1997, 1996, 2240, 1010, 3084, 1037, 5376, 11043, 1010, 4332, 2010, 2067, 2000, 1996, 2314, 1010, 3216, 1037, 2261, 12963, 9530, 2102, 1012, 4084, 1999, 2646, 1996, 3509, 1010, 1998, 3464, 19917, 1010, 5266, 2010, 2227, 2007, 2010, 2398, 1012, 1012, 1012, 1996, 3496, 2001, 2061, 3435, 2008, 1010, 2043, 2057, 2387, 2009, 1010, 2673, 2018, 2525, 3047, 1024, 1996, 3869, 2018, 2908, 2185, 2007, 1996, 2972, 2240, 1012, 1996, 2060, 6505, 5935, 2039, 2037, 3869, 6806, 6559, 2015, 1010, 2029, 2027, 2018, 1999, 2037, 2398, 1010, 1998, 1010, 2302, 3038, 1037, 2773, 1010, 2253, 2000, 4682, 2091, 2379, 1996, 2543, 1012, 12491, 1010, 2130, 2062, 7622, 2011, 2054, 2057, 2018, 9741, 1010, 2057, 2356, 1996, 2339, 1997, 2107, 2307, 1998, 17631, 4469, 3567, 5289, 3401, 1012, 2044, 1037, 2261, 5312, 1010, 2004, 2065, 2025, 2000, 4025, 5665, 1011, 5450, 2098, 1010, 2027, 4660, 3243, 2659, 1010, 4510, 2000, 2022, 2657, 1024, 1523, 29432, 2063, 1006, 4382, 1997, 1996, 4763, 1007, 4845, 23212, 2050, 1010, 14255, 19848, 5400, 1006, 5744, 1011, 19937, 3869, 1997, 1996, 3267, 1997, 1996, 14855, 2226, 1013, 2703, 6610, 2050, 11320, 2102, 7520, 2072, 1013, 1012, 2122, 2048, 102]}, {"score": 0.7149045467376709, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "The principal illnesses that the bari -- sucking -- takes from the body of the patients are:", "predicted_label": 0, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 4054, 24757, 2008, 1996, 22466, 1011, 1011, 13475, 1011, 1011, 3138, 2013, 1996, 2303, 1997, 1996, 5022, 2024, 1024, 102]}, {"score": 0.9140573740005493, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "1) geri-guira-re-u , \u201cthat of the horned face,\u201d cf. geri , \u201cface, his face,\u201d kiga , \u201chorn\u201d;

A man should no eat his totem bird, the penalty for transgressing this rule being a swollen stomach and perhaps death. But even this fundamental rule is breaking down under foreign influence, for Mr Bellamy writes: 'I have known a hungry woman break this rule and though a Mimalasi, eat a pigeon which I had shot. If she had suffered form any sickness afterwards, either immediately or after some little time, this would have been put down to the breaking of the rule. There appears to have been no actual tribal punishment for eating the totem.' Under these circumstances the difficulty of ascertaining the attitude of the islanders to their less important totems is not surprising; probably there is a large personal element in the mater, and the following statements must be considered in this light.

It was said that men know charms to make rain to fall, the sun to shine, and to stop adverse winds, and that such knowledge is usually transmitted in certain families, men teaching their sons or their sisters' children. A charm for stopping rain is to chew ginger which is then expectorated in a fine spray, a formula which ends in a high-pitched sibilant -- s -- s being muttered the while. The same process with different words is used when it is desired to make the wind abate, and I believe that this process with appropriate words is used to propitiate or avert any possibly dangerous influence, as for instance that which a stranger may reasonably be expected to exert.

But if it were a question of treating of any other aspect of the tribal life of these natives, it would also be found that, whenever they approach any concern of vital importance, they summon magic to their aid. It can be said without exaggeration that magic, according to their ideas, governs human destinies; that it supplies man with the power of mastering the forces of nature; and that it is his weapon and armour against the many dangers which crowd in upon him on every side.) Thus, in what is most essential to man, that is in his health and bodily welfare, he is but a plaything of the powers of sorcery, of evil spirits and of certain beings, controlled by black magic . Death in almost all its forms is the result of one of these agencies. Permanent ill-health and all kinds of acute sickness, in fact everything, except such easily explainable ailments as physical overstrain or slight colds, are attributed to magic. I have spoken (Chapter II) of the several ways in which the evil powers bring disease and death. The tauva'u , who bring epidemics and the tokway , who inflict shooting pains and minor ailments, are the only examples of non-human beings' exerting any direct influence on human destinies, and even the members of this restricted pantheon of demonology only occasionally descend among the mortals to put into action their potential powers. By far the deepest dread and most constant concern of the natives are with the bwaga'u , the entirely human sorcerers, who carry out their work exclusively by means of magic. Second to them in the quantity of magical output and in the frequency of their exploits, are the mulukwausi , the flying witches, which have been described in detail in Chapter XI. They are a good example of how every belief in a superior power is at the bottom a belief in magic. Magic gives to these beings the capacity to destroy human life and to command other agents of destruction. Magic also gives man the power and the means to defend himself, and if properly applied, to frustrate all the nefarious attempts of the mulukwausi . Comparing the two agencies, it may be said that in every-day life, the sorcerer is by far the most feared and is most frequently believed to be at work; while the mulukwausi enter upon the scene at certain dramatic moments, such as the presence of death, a catastrophe on land, and more especially at sea; but then, they enter with even deadlier weapons than the bwaga'u . Health, the normal state of human beings can, if once lost, be regained by magic and by magic only. There is no such thing as natural recovery, return to health being always due to the removal of the evil magic by means of magical counter-action .", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2035, 1996, 2951, 2029, 2031, 2042, 2061, 2521, 21900, 26056, 1996, 6034, 5197, 1997, 3894, 1999, 1996, 13970, 2721, 1012, 2021, 2065, 2009, 2020, 1037, 3160, 1997, 12318, 1997, 2151, 2060, 7814, 1997, 1996, 8807, 2166, 1997, 2122, 12493, 1010, 2009, 2052, 2036, 2022, 2179, 2008, 1010, 7188, 2027, 3921, 2151, 5142, 1997, 8995, 5197, 1010, 2027, 18654, 3894, 2000, 2037, 4681, 1012, 2009, 2064, 2022, 2056, 2302, 4654, 27609, 3370, 2008, 3894, 1010, 2429, 2000, 2037, 4784, 1010, 21208, 2015, 2529, 4078, 7629, 3111, 1025, 2008, 2009, 6067, 2158, 2007, 1996, 2373, 1997, 11495, 1996, 2749, 1997, 3267, 1025, 1998, 2008, 2009, 2003, 2010, 5195, 1998, 12371, 2114, 1996, 2116, 16796, 2029, 4306, 1999, 2588, 2032, 2006, 2296, 2217, 1012, 1007, 2947, 1010, 1999, 2054, 2003, 2087, 6827, 2000, 2158, 1010, 2008, 2003, 1999, 2010, 2740, 1998, 20445, 7574, 1010, 2002, 2003, 2021, 1037, 2377, 20744, 1997, 1996, 4204, 1997, 2061, 19170, 2854, 1010, 1997, 4763, 8633, 1998, 1997, 3056, 9552, 1010, 4758, 2011, 2304, 3894, 1012, 2331, 1999, 2471, 2035, 2049, 3596, 2003, 1996, 2765, 1997, 2028, 1997, 2122, 6736, 1012, 4568, 5665, 1011, 2740, 1998, 2035, 7957, 1997, 11325, 15556, 1010, 1999, 2755, 2673, 1010, 3272, 2107, 4089, 4863, 3085, 9932, 13728, 11187, 2004, 3558, 15849, 23654, 2030, 7263, 3147, 2015, 1010, 2024, 7108, 2000, 3894, 1012, 1045, 2031, 5287, 1006, 3127, 2462, 1007, 1997, 1996, 2195, 3971, 1999, 2029, 1996, 4763, 4204, 3288, 4295, 1998, 2331, 1012, 1996, 19982, 3567, 1005, 1057, 1010, 2040, 3288, 16311, 2015, 1998, 1996, 2000, 2243, 4576, 1010, 2040, 1999, 29301, 5008, 20398, 1998, 3576, 9932, 13728, 11187, 1010, 2024, 1996, 2069, 4973, 1997, 2512, 1011, 2529, 9552, 1005, 4654, 8743, 2075, 2151, 3622, 3747, 2006, 2529, 4078, 7629, 3111, 1010, 1998, 2130, 1996, 2372, 1997, 2023, 7775, 24152, 1997, 5698, 6779, 2069, 5681, 18855, 2426, 1996, 23844, 2000, 2404, 2046, 2895, 2037, 4022, 4204, 1012, 2011, 2521, 1996, 17578, 14436, 1998, 2087, 5377, 5142, 1997, 1996, 12493, 2024, 2007, 1996, 1038, 4213, 3654, 1005, 1057, 1010, 1996, 4498, 2529, 23324, 2015, 1010, 2040, 4287, 2041, 2037, 2147, 7580, 2011, 2965, 1997, 3894, 1012, 2117, 2000, 2068, 1999, 1996, 11712, 1997, 8687, 6434, 1998, 1999, 1996, 6075, 1997, 2037, 20397, 1010, 2024, 1996, 14163, 7630, 2243, 4213, 2271, 2072, 1010, 1996, 3909, 12566, 1010, 2029, 2031, 2042, 2649, 1999, 6987, 1999, 3127, 8418, 1012, 2027, 2024, 1037, 2204, 2742, 1997, 2129, 2296, 6772, 1999, 1037, 6020, 2373, 2003, 2012, 1996, 3953, 1037, 6772, 1999, 3894, 1012, 3894, 3957, 2000, 2122, 9552, 1996, 3977, 2000, 6033, 2529, 2166, 1998, 2000, 3094, 2060, 6074, 1997, 6215, 1012, 3894, 2036, 3957, 2158, 1996, 2373, 1998, 1996, 2965, 2000, 6985, 2370, 1010, 1998, 2065, 7919, 4162, 1010, 2000, 10424, 19966, 11657, 2035, 1996, 11265, 14971, 6313, 4740, 1997, 1996, 14163, 7630, 2243, 4213, 2271, 2072, 1012, 13599, 1996, 2048, 6736, 1010, 2009, 2089, 2022, 2056, 2008, 1999, 2296, 1011, 2154, 2166, 1010, 1996, 23324, 2003, 2011, 2521, 1996, 2087, 8615, 1998, 2003, 2087, 4703, 3373, 2000, 2022, 2012, 2147, 1025, 2096, 1996, 14163, 7630, 2243, 102]}, {"score": 0.9634100794792175, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Although wizards and witches alike are believed to abound in the Trobriands, the power of the wizards, according to Malinowski, is \"extremely poor\" when compared to that of the witches.

Anyone who chances to be exposed to them is sure to be attacked\" (Malinowski 1955:152-53). Dangerous on land, these \"terrible women\" are even more dangerous on sea, where they destroy shipwrecked sailors (Malinowski [1922] 1961:chapter 10). Although, on land, witches may sometimes cause such ailments as toothaches, swelling of the testicles, tumors, and genital discharge ( SLS :47), more typically they kill and eat their unfortunate victims. Pouncing on them from some hidden -- usually high --place, the invisible witch removes their insides, together with their eyes and tongue, before eating them ( SLS :45). Possessed of \"ghoulish instincts,\" witches not only eat their living victims, but also devour entire corpses, thereby be-coming \"more than ever dangerous to the living\" (Malinowski 1955:153). That is why, following a death, Trobrianders refuse to talk about the village or to enter the surrounding cultivated land. Although they are especially dangerous at that time, witches are \"objects of real terror\" at all times (ibid.).", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2348, 16657, 1998, 12566, 11455, 2024, 3373, 2000, 11113, 28819, 1999, 1996, 19817, 16429, 6862, 5104, 1010, 1996, 2373, 1997, 1996, 16657, 1010, 2429, 2000, 16007, 19779, 5488, 1010, 2003, 1000, 5186, 3532, 1000, 2043, 4102, 2000, 2008, 1997, 1996, 12566, 1012, 2947, 1010, 6168, 1037, 10276, 2064, 1010, 2012, 2190, 1010, 1999, 29301, 1037, 15304, 4295, 1010, 2029, 2003, 4089, 21391, 2011, 4675, 3894, 1010, 2045, 2003, 1000, 2210, 3382, 1000, 1997, 4337, 2075, 1996, 3287, 6767, 16136, 3450, 1997, 1037, 6965, 1006, 22889, 2015, 1024, 1018, 1010, 1019, 1011, 4805, 1007, 1012, 12566, 1011, 2170, 14163, 7630, 5283, 20559, 2080, 1006, 16007, 19779, 5488, 3982, 1007, 1010, 2030, 14163, 7630, 2243, 4213, 2271, 2072, 1006, 16007, 19779, 5488, 1031, 4798, 1033, 3777, 1007, 1011, 1011, 2024, 1000, 5025, 2542, 2308, 2040, 2089, 2022, 2124, 1998, 5720, 2007, 1999, 6623, 2166, 1005, 1000, 2021, 2040, 1010, 1999, 1037, 4487, 3366, 13344, 10265, 2094, 2433, 1010, 1000, 2024, 5186, 6819, 6820, 16136, 1010, 3928, 1010, 1998, 2036, 28498, 1012, 3087, 2040, 9592, 2000, 2022, 6086, 2000, 2068, 2003, 2469, 2000, 2022, 4457, 1000, 1006, 16007, 19779, 5488, 3982, 1024, 15017, 1011, 5187, 1007, 1012, 4795, 2006, 2455, 1010, 2122, 1000, 6659, 2308, 1000, 2024, 2130, 2062, 4795, 2006, 2712, 1010, 2073, 2027, 6033, 2911, 13088, 11012, 2098, 11279, 1006, 16007, 19779, 5488, 1031, 4798, 1033, 3777, 1024, 3127, 2184, 1007, 1012, 2348, 1010, 2006, 2455, 1010, 12566, 2089, 2823, 3426, 2107, 9932, 13728, 11187, 2004, 11868, 15395, 2015, 1010, 18348, 1997, 1996, 3231, 20921, 1010, 21434, 1010, 1998, 8991, 18400, 11889, 1006, 22889, 2015, 1024, 4700, 1007, 1010, 2062, 4050, 2027, 3102, 1998, 4521, 2037, 15140, 5694, 1012, 13433, 4609, 6129, 2006, 2068, 2013, 2070, 5023, 1011, 1011, 2788, 2152, 1011, 1011, 2173, 1010, 1996, 8841, 6965, 20362, 2037, 19008, 1010, 2362, 2007, 2037, 2159, 1998, 4416, 1010, 2077, 5983, 2068, 1006, 22889, 2015, 1024, 3429, 1007, 1012, 8679, 1997, 1000, 1043, 6806, 15859, 4095, 16160, 1010, 1000, 12566, 2025, 2069, 4521, 2037, 2542, 5694, 1010, 2021, 2036, 16475, 8162, 2972, 18113, 1010, 8558, 2022, 1011, 2746, 1000, 2062, 2084, 2412, 4795, 2000, 1996, 2542, 1000, 1006, 16007, 19779, 5488, 3982, 1024, 16710, 1007, 1012, 2008, 2003, 2339, 1010, 2206, 1037, 2331, 1010, 19817, 16429, 6862, 13375, 10214, 2000, 2831, 2055, 1996, 2352, 2030, 2000, 4607, 1996, 4193, 13237, 2455, 1012, 2348, 2027, 2024, 2926, 4795, 2012, 2008, 2051, 1010, 12566, 2024, 1000, 5200, 1997, 2613, 7404, 1000, 2012, 2035, 2335, 1006, 21307, 3593, 1012, 1007, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9667167067527771, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Thus, through the conflict between granddaughter and grandmother, human beings, one and all, had to submit to the process of decay and debility brought on by old age.

In order to understand the full cycle of their beliefs it is necessary to study the factors of illness, decay, and death. The native of the Trobriands is definitely an optimist in his attitude to health and illness. Strength, vigour, and bodily perfection are to him the natural status which can only be affected or upset by an accident or by a supernatural cause. Small accidents such as excessive fatigue, sunstroke, over-eating, or exposure may cause minor and temporary ailments. By a spear in battle, by poison, by a fall from a rock or a tree a man may be maimed or killed. Whether these accidents and others, such as drowning and the attack of a crocodile or a shark, are entirely free from sorcery is ever a debatable question to a native. But there is no doubt whatever to him that all serious and especially all fatal illnesses are due to various forms and agencies of witchcraft.

Some of them even occurred while I was in the Trobriands; there was a severe dysentery once, and the first outbreak of what probably was Spanish influenza in 1918. Many natives reported having heard the tauva'u . A giant lizard was seen in Wawela; the man who killed it died soon after, and the epidemic broke out in the village. While I was in Oburaku, and sickness was rife in the village, a real tauva'u was seen by the crew of the boat in which I was being paddled; a large multicoloured snake appeared on a mangrove, but vanished mysteriously as we came near. It was only through my short-sightedness, and perhaps also my ignorance of how to look for a tauva'u , that I failed to observe this miracle myself.

Many of these break off short and in due course set up irritation necessitating their removal. Firstly the sufferer tries to remove the foreign body from the skin with his finger-nails; failing to succeed by this method, he cuts a small piece of wood the shape of an awl, and with its sharp point removes the obstacle. The prickle is often completely buried and quite invisible to the eye, yet it has to be removed. In order to locate it under those conditions, the aboriginal resorts to the method, not infrequently applied [118] by the modern surgeon, of gently pressing the skin at different places with the tip of the instrument until the seat of pain has been located. At that spot he cuts away the skin to a depth sufficient to expose the hidden body, which he can then in most cases express with his fingers.

After I had completed writing down the myth of Krantjirinja, the kangaroo chief of Krantji, the members of the Krantji group presented a series of ceremonies known as Utnitjia Nama. These are the most secret of all the multitudinous rites performed near the Northern kangaroo centre, rites which in past times might be witnessed only by members of the inner kangaroo clan of Krantji. All other men were rigidly excluded from Utnitjia Nama ceremonies, even if they belonged to neighbouring Northern Aranda totemic groups. At my Alice Springs camp, however, quite a number of Northern men other than those belonging to the kangaroo totem, were allowed to witness these increase-rites by Ekuntjarinja, the present leader of the Krantji clan. A few days later he suddenly took ill, and complained of acute pains in his back; and both he and the other elderly [30] men present were certain that these pains had been caused by the anger of the offended Krantjirinja himself, who had struck Ekuntjarinja because the latter had frivolously exhibited the sacred ceremonies to people to whom he had been strictly forbidden to show them by his elders when they first instructed him.

They believe that the spirit part of the child goes back at once to the particular spot from whence it came, and can be born again at some subsequent time even of the same woman. Twins, which are of extremely rare occurrence, are usually killed immediately as something which is unnatural; but there is no ill-treatment of the mother, who is not thought any the less of. We cannot find out what, exactly, lies at the root of this dislike of twins in the case of the Arunta and other tribes. Possibly it is to be explained on the simple ground that the parent feels a not altogether unrighteous anger that two spirit individuals should think of entering the body of the woman at one and the same time, when they know well that the mother could not possibly rear them both, added to which the advent of twins is a very infrequent event, and the native always has a dread of anything which appears strange and out of the common. In connection with this it may be noted that on the very rare occasions on which the child is born at a very premature stage as the result of an accident, nothing will persuade them that it is an undeveloped human being; they are perfectly convinced that it is the young of some other animal, such as a kangaroo, which has by mistake got inside the woman. 1 Sterility is of frequent occurrence at the present day amongst the native women. The greatest fertility is amongst the strong stout women, the thin and weaker ones rarely having children. Possibly sterility in many cases is associated with injury received during the initiation rite of Ariltakuma. The natives believe that it may be brought about by a girl in her youth playfully or thoughtlessly tying on a man's hair waist-band.

His chief function is undoubtedly that of curing the natives; but as all ailments of every kind, from the simplest to the most serious, are without exception attributed to the malign influence of an enemy in either human or spirit shape, the method of curing takes the form of an exhibition of what is really sleight of hand, the object being to remove from the body of the patient something, such as a pointing-stick or the broken pieces of a Churinga, which have been placed in it by the enemy. In many Australian tribes the equivalent of the medicine man amongst the Arunta is the one individual who can hold intercourse with the spirits; but in this tribe this is by no means the case, as there are men who, without being medicine men, are especially favoured in this respect. In many tribes also it is only the medicine men or their equivalents who have the power of, for example, securing by means of special incantations the illness or death of the individual whom it is desired to harm, and therefore, to secure this end, recourse must be had to a medicine man. In the Arunta, Ilpirra and other of the Central Australian tribes this does not hold true; every man may have rec\u00f3urse to what is usually spoken of as sorcery, by means of which he may work harm of some kind to an enemy, and this power is not in any way confined to the medicine men, though, on the other hand, they are the only men who can counteract the evil influence of an enemy. At the same time, there are certain of the very old medicine men who are supposed to be endowed by the Ivuntarinia with the special power of bringing disease down upon not only individuals, but whole groups of men and women.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2061, 2521, 2004, 2010, 4972, 2024, 4986, 1010, 1996, 4200, 2158, 2089, 2022, 5240, 2004, 6576, 1010, 3383, 1999, 1996, 2364, 1010, 2054, 2023, 2171, 12748, 1010, 1998, 2012, 1996, 2168, 2051, 2004, 1037, 10276, 1012, 2010, 2708, 3853, 2003, 17319, 2008, 1997, 12731, 4892, 1996, 12493, 1025, 2021, 2004, 2035, 9932, 13728, 11187, 1997, 2296, 2785, 1010, 2013, 1996, 21304, 2000, 1996, 2087, 3809, 1010, 2024, 2302, 6453, 7108, 2000, 1996, 16007, 16206, 3747, 1997, 2019, 4099, 1999, 2593, 2529, 2030, 4382, 4338, 1010, 1996, 4118, 1997, 12731, 4892, 3138, 1996, 2433, 1997, 2019, 4538, 1997, 2054, 2003, 2428, 22889, 7416, 13900, 1997, 2192, 1010, 1996, 4874, 2108, 2000, 6366, 2013, 1996, 2303, 1997, 1996, 5776, 2242, 1010, 2107, 2004, 1037, 7302, 1011, 6293, 2030, 1996, 3714, 4109, 1997, 1037, 14684, 4892, 2050, 1010, 2029, 2031, 2042, 2872, 1999, 2009, 2011, 1996, 4099, 1012, 1999, 2116, 2827, 6946, 1996, 5662, 1997, 1996, 4200, 2158, 5921, 1996, 28217, 2696, 2003, 1996, 2028, 3265, 2040, 2064, 2907, 23198, 2007, 1996, 8633, 1025, 2021, 1999, 2023, 5917, 2023, 2003, 2011, 2053, 2965, 1996, 2553, 1010, 2004, 2045, 2024, 2273, 2040, 1010, 2302, 2108, 4200, 2273, 1010, 2024, 2926, 16822, 1999, 2023, 4847, 1012, 1999, 2116, 6946, 2036, 2009, 2003, 2069, 1996, 4200, 2273, 2030, 2037, 5662, 2015, 2040, 2031, 1996, 2373, 1997, 1010, 2005, 2742, 1010, 12329, 2011, 2965, 1997, 2569, 27523, 23436, 2015, 1996, 7355, 2030, 2331, 1997, 1996, 3265, 3183, 2009, 2003, 9059, 2000, 7386, 1010, 1998, 3568, 1010, 2000, 5851, 2023, 2203, 1010, 28667, 22957, 2063, 2442, 2022, 2018, 2000, 1037, 4200, 2158, 1012, 1999, 1996, 28217, 2696, 1010, 6335, 8197, 11335, 1998, 2060, 1997, 1996, 2430, 2827, 6946, 2023, 2515, 2025, 2907, 2995, 1025, 2296, 2158, 2089, 2031, 28667, 22957, 2063, 2000, 2054, 2003, 2788, 5287, 1997, 2004, 2061, 19170, 2854, 1010, 2011, 2965, 1997, 2029, 2002, 2089, 2147, 7386, 1997, 2070, 2785, 2000, 2019, 4099, 1010, 1998, 2023, 2373, 2003, 2025, 1999, 2151, 2126, 12302, 2000, 1996, 4200, 2273, 1010, 2295, 1010, 2006, 1996, 2060, 2192, 1010, 2027, 2024, 1996, 2069, 2273, 2040, 2064, 4675, 18908, 1996, 4763, 3747, 1997, 2019, 4099, 1012, 2012, 1996, 2168, 2051, 1010, 2045, 2024, 3056, 1997, 1996, 2200, 2214, 4200, 2273, 2040, 2024, 4011, 2000, 2022, 19038, 2011, 1996, 4921, 16671, 8486, 6200, 2007, 1996, 2569, 2373, 1997, 5026, 4295, 2091, 2588, 2025, 2069, 3633, 1010, 2021, 2878, 2967, 1997, 2273, 1998, 2308, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9640690684318542, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "In cases of sickness the natives have implicit faith in the medicine man, and in serious cases two or three, if they be available, are called in, in consultation. 1 In connection with medicine men restrictions such as those applying to Mura are laid on one side during the actual exercise of their profession.

This suction is one of the most characteristic features of native medical treatment, as pain in any part of the body is always supposed to be due to the presence of some foreign body, which must be removed. Amongst especially the Western Arunta the medicine man, in addition to the Atnongara stones, is supposed to have a particular kind of lizard distributed through his body, which endows him with great suctorial power, such as the natives attribute to the lizard itself. In serious cases the action is more dramatic, and the medicine man needs a clear space in which to perform. The patient, perhaps too ill to sit up, is supported by some individual, while the medicine man who has been called in, and may have come a long distance, gravely examines him and consults with other practirioners who may be present, and with the more immediate relatives of the patient, as to the nature of the illness. The diagnosis may occupy some time, during which everyone maintains a very solemn appearance, all conversation being carried on in whispers. As a result the medicine man will perhaps pronounce that the sick man is suffering from a charmed bone inserted by a magic individual, such as a Kurdaitcha; or perhaps, worse still, the verdict is that one of the Iruntarinia has placed in his body an Ullinka or short barbed stick attached to an invisible string, the pulling of which by the malicious spirit causes great pain (Fig. 119 nos. 10, 11). If the latter be the case it requires the greatest skill of a renowned medicine man to effect a cure. While the patient is supported in a half-sitting attitude, the medicine man will first of all stand close by, gazing down upon him in the most intent way. Then suddenly he will go some yards off, and looking fiercely at him, bends slightly forwards and repeatedly jerks his arm outwards at full length, with the hand outstretched, the object being thereby to project some of the Atnongara stones into the patient's body, the object of this being to counteract the evil influence at work within the latter. Going rapidly and with a characteristic high knee action from one end of the cleared space to the other, he repeats the movement with dramatic action. Finally, he comes close again, and, after much mysterious searching, finds and cuts the string, which is invisible to everyone except himself. There is not a doubt amongst the onlookers as to his having really done this. Then once more the projecting of the Ainongara stones takes place, and crouching down over the sick man he places his mouth upon the afiected part and sucks, until at last the Ullinka is extracted, either in fragments or, very rarely, and only if he be a very distinguished medicine man, whole, and is shown to the wondering onlookers, the Atnongara stones returning, unseen, once more into his own body. When this is over, unless it is simply a case of senile decay-on the part of the patient, in which case the medicine man is too acute to take so much trouble, when he knows pretty well that there is no possibility of effecting a cure, the chances are strongly in favour of the latter, but if death ensues FIG. 120.--POSITION ASSUMED WHEN USING THE UNGAKURA POINTING APPARATUS.

Though there was apparently nothing serious the matter with him, still he persisted in saying that the spear had been charmed and that he must die, which accordingly he did in the course of a few days. Another man coming down to the Alice Springs from the Tennant Creek contracted a slight cold, but the local men told him that the members of a group about twelve miles away to the east had taken his heart out, and believing this to be so, he simply laid himself down and wasted away. In a similar way a man at Charlotte Waters came to us with a slight spear wound in his back. He was assured that the wound was not serious, and it was dressed in the usual way, but he persisted in saying that the spear had been \u201csung,\u201d and that though it could not be seen, yet in reality it had broken his back and he was going to die, which accordingly he did.

the men do, are still supposed to be able to exercise peculiar powers in regard to the sexual organs. 1 As a peneral rule women are not supposed to be able to exercise much magic, except in regard to the sexual organs, but we have known of a woman being speared to death by the brother of her husband, who accused her of having killed the latter by means of a pointing-stick. To bring on a painful affection in those of men, a woman will procure the spear-like seed of a long grass ( Inturkirra ),and having charmed it by singing some magic chant over it, she awaits an opportunity to point and throw it towards the man whom she desires to mjure. Shortly after this has been done the man experiences pain, as if he had been stung by ants, his parts become swollen, and he at once attributes his sufferings to the magic influence of some woman who wishes to injure him. A woman may also charm a handful of dust which she collects while out digging up yams or gathering seeds, and having \u201csung\u201d it, brings it into camp with her.

They are of the type: X is true because Y has happened; or, alternatively, since Y, then X. Garfinkel has called this the documentary method (Garfinkel n.d.). It is characteristic of the documentary method that there is hardly ever a set of past events which deny some set of inferences the documentary method provides. 2 This characteristic of the documentary method is explicated in an experiment by Garfinkel ( op. cit .). Subjects were told that they should report by phone to counselors serious problems they were experiencing. Whenever the subject thought of a question to which the counselor could answer yes or no, he was instructed to ask the question. The counselor then answered each question yes or no. The subjects were required to interpret the counselor's response. In every case the subjects were able to \u201cmake sense\u201d out of the counselor's response. The counselors' responses were drawn from a table of random numbers. Thus, in Aguacatenango, an epidemic stops because the witch who was causing it has been killed; if, on the other hand, the epidemic does not stop with the killing of a witch, then another witch must be responsible. Again, a sick person gets well because a curing ceremony has been performed; if he does not get well after the ceremony, then his illness must be witchcraft and the witch more powerful than the curer.

Types of experiences which lead the individual to anticipate illness include either becoming angry or being an object of anger; experiencing extreme fright, as when one has had dreams, or has seen the image of some malevolent non-human force (i.e., a ladino dressed in black riding a tall horse); and drinking aguardiente.

Conditions which are used to explain illness only after-the-fact tend to be more properly theoretical in that they explain at once the necessary and sufficient conditions for some non-hypothetical occurrence of some disease process.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 3785, 2029, 3653, 22119, 1996, 14447, 1997, 7355, 2024, 2116, 1998, 9426, 1012, 2096, 2070, 1997, 2068, 2024, 2124, 2000, 2022, 14405, 26005, 16454, 2000, 7355, 1999, 1996, 3168, 2008, 2065, 2019, 3265, 6322, 2028, 1997, 2122, 3785, 1996, 9723, 2003, 3445, 2008, 2002, 2097, 2468, 5665, 1010, 2045, 2024, 9690, 2116, 3785, 2029, 2468, 16474, 1997, 1996, 7355, 2069, 2044, 1996, 3265, 11859, 2370, 1998, 2003, 4225, 2004, 2108, 5665, 1012, 4127, 1997, 6322, 2029, 2599, 1996, 3265, 2000, 3424, 6895, 17585, 7355, 2421, 2593, 3352, 4854, 2030, 2108, 2019, 4874, 1997, 4963, 1025, 13417, 6034, 25966, 1010, 2004, 2043, 2028, 2038, 2018, 5544, 1010, 2030, 2038, 2464, 1996, 3746, 1997, 2070, 3287, 6767, 16136, 2512, 1011, 2529, 2486, 1006, 1045, 1012, 1041, 1012, 1010, 1037, 14804, 5740, 5102, 1999, 2304, 5559, 1037, 4206, 3586, 1007, 1025, 1998, 5948, 12943, 6692, 17080, 15781, 1012, 2122, 1998, 2714, 6322, 4287, 4568, 8924, 2007, 7355, 1025, 1996, 3265, 24273, 2000, 2468, 5665, 1998, 2411, 2515, 2061, 1012, 3785, 2029, 2024, 2109, 2000, 4863, 7355, 2069, 2044, 1011, 1996, 1011, 2755, 7166, 2000, 2022, 2062, 7919, 9373, 1999, 2008, 2027, 4863, 2012, 2320, 1996, 4072, 1998, 7182, 3785, 2005, 2070, 2512, 1011, 25613, 14404, 1997, 2070, 4295, 2832, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9686645865440369, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Among the after-the-fact explanations one finds statements such as, \u201cthe patient is suffering from soul loss, his soul presently residing in the Owner of the Cave's soul pool.\u201d Or, \u201cthe man is suffering from malaria which he got in hot country the last time he went to the fincas.\u201d Or, \u201cthe man's spirit is being eaten by a witch, Mr. X, who is angry with him because he did not pay back the money he owed.\u201d Every after-the-fact description of antece dent conditions implies a cause and effect relation such that the cause can be manipulated so as the patient will recover from the illness.

If a change capability is built into this theory of illness in Aguacatenango, it is not easy to detect wherein it lies. 1 The modes of change that we have observed in Aguacatenangueros' response to illness have involved shifts from known medical practitioners to others, where the theory remains relatively unexplicated and the results of the medical practitioner's progress are used to judge the probability of opting some particular medical practitioner for a cure rather than some other. Response to illness involves the principle of exhaustion of resources. In severe illness, the family of the patient may exhaust all known medical practitioners who are thought to have sufficient knowledge and skill and also may exhaust all means for motivating curers to come and perform the cure. With the diminution of resources and exhaustion of the most proper curers, the family of the patient explores curing sources whose potential for curing may be lower, but still appreciable. Successful curing under such circumstances raises the probability that this family will use some newly successful medical practitioner sooner in the next onset of illness, that is, he will be called upon before they have exhausted their resources. The introduction of INI medical practice into Aguacatenango has been in these terms, namely, that patients and their families have turned to INI medical personnel upon the exhaustion of their resources. INI procedures have maintained a ratio of successes over failures in these curing circumstances such that they have continued to be called upon, in some cases under less extreme conditions. The ratio of successes over failures has not been so great, however, that INI is seen to be a totally satisfactory replacement for the more well established practitioners. Furthermore, INI treats only a small proportion of the total range of \u201cillnesses\u201d that occur in the community. INI will increase the proportion of cases it treats as it modifies the Aguacatenangueros' perception of the success' failure ratio and as it increases the classes of illness that it deals with. It may be the case that INI has at present a maximal investment in time and resources in maintaining its present range and success proportion, so future severe changes may not be expected from them. There is, however, some generalization to other INI type of curers--namely, doctors in San Cristobal. The generalization here may increase the use of doctors over curers. There is the further possibility that curers are incorporating into their theories some of the simpler strategies used by doctors. This is done so crudely that it hardly involves change of beliefs at any detailed level, but rather involves a simple increase of the inventories of medicine by means of which the curer implements his theory.", "predicted_label": 0, "input_ids": [101, 2045, 2003, 4659, 2210, 13216, 24508, 14709, 2005, 5815, 2000, 1996, 12612, 1997, 2044, 1011, 1996, 1011, 2755, 17959, 1010, 1998, 2045, 2024, 4659, 2261, 5733, 2005, 29226, 1996, 11583, 1997, 8720, 1997, 1996, 3426, 1997, 1996, 4295, 2832, 1012, 2065, 1037, 2689, 10673, 2003, 2328, 2046, 2023, 3399, 1997, 7355, 1999, 12943, 6692, 16280, 7229, 3995, 1010, 2009, 2003, 2025, 3733, 2000, 11487, 16726, 2009, 3658, 1012, 1015, 1996, 11583, 1997, 2689, 2008, 2057, 2031, 5159, 1999, 12943, 6692, 16280, 7229, 9077, 7352, 1005, 3433, 2000, 7355, 2031, 2920, 12363, 2013, 2124, 2966, 14617, 2000, 2500, 1010, 2073, 1996, 3399, 3464, 4659, 16655, 2595, 24759, 17872, 1998, 1996, 3463, 1997, 1996, 2966, 18742, 1005, 1055, 5082, 2024, 2109, 2000, 3648, 1996, 9723, 1997, 23569, 2075, 2070, 3327, 2966, 18742, 2005, 1037, 9526, 2738, 2084, 2070, 2060, 1012, 3433, 2000, 7355, 7336, 1996, 6958, 1997, 15575, 1997, 4219, 1012, 1999, 5729, 7355, 1010, 1996, 2155, 1997, 1996, 5776, 2089, 15095, 2035, 2124, 2966, 14617, 2040, 2024, 2245, 2000, 2031, 7182, 3716, 1998, 8066, 1998, 2036, 2089, 15095, 2035, 2965, 2005, 9587, 29068, 5844, 9526, 2869, 2000, 2272, 1998, 4685, 1996, 9526, 1012, 2007, 1996, 11737, 2378, 13700, 1997, 4219, 1998, 15575, 1997, 1996, 2087, 5372, 9526, 2869, 1010, 1996, 2155, 1997, 1996, 5776, 15102, 12731, 4892, 4216, 3005, 4022, 2005, 12731, 4892, 2089, 2022, 2896, 1010, 2021, 2145, 10439, 2890, 7405, 3468, 1012, 3144, 12731, 4892, 2104, 2107, 6214, 13275, 1996, 9723, 2008, 2023, 2155, 2097, 2224, 2070, 4397, 3144, 2966, 18742, 10076, 1999, 1996, 2279, 14447, 1997, 7355, 1010, 2008, 2003, 1010, 2002, 2097, 2022, 2170, 2588, 2077, 2027, 2031, 9069, 2037, 4219, 1012, 1996, 4955, 1997, 1999, 2072, 2966, 3218, 2046, 12943, 6692, 16280, 7229, 3995, 2038, 2042, 1999, 2122, 3408, 1010, 8419, 1010, 2008, 5022, 1998, 2037, 2945, 2031, 2357, 2000, 1999, 2072, 2966, 5073, 2588, 1996, 15575, 1997, 2037, 4219, 1012, 1999, 2072, 8853, 2031, 5224, 1037, 6463, 1997, 14152, 2058, 15428, 1999, 2122, 12731, 4892, 6214, 2107, 2008, 2027, 2031, 2506, 2000, 2022, 2170, 2588, 1010, 1999, 2070, 3572, 2104, 2625, 6034, 3785, 1012, 1996, 6463, 1997, 14152, 2058, 15428, 2038, 2025, 2042, 2061, 2307, 1010, 2174, 1010, 2008, 1999, 2072, 2003, 2464, 2000, 2022, 1037, 6135, 23045, 6110, 2005, 1996, 2062, 2092, 2511, 14617, 1012, 7297, 1010, 1999, 2072, 18452, 2069, 1037, 2235, 10817, 1997, 1996, 2561, 2846, 1997, 1523, 24757, 1524, 2008, 5258, 1999, 1996, 2451, 1012, 1999, 2072, 2097, 3623, 1996, 10817, 1997, 3572, 2009, 18452, 2004, 2009, 16913, 14144, 1996, 12943, 6692, 16280, 7229, 9077, 7352, 1005, 10617, 1997, 1996, 3112, 1005, 4945, 6463, 1998, 2004, 2009, 7457, 1996, 4280, 1997, 7355, 2008, 2009, 9144, 2007, 1012, 2009, 2089, 2022, 1996, 2553, 2008, 1999, 2072, 2038, 2012, 2556, 1037, 29160, 5211, 1999, 2051, 1998, 4219, 1999, 8498, 2049, 2556, 2846, 1998, 3112, 10817, 1010, 2061, 2925, 5729, 3431, 2089, 2025, 2022, 3517, 2013, 2068, 1012, 2045, 2003, 1010, 2174, 1010, 2070, 2236, 3989, 2000, 2060, 1999, 2072, 2828, 1997, 9526, 2869, 1011, 1011, 8419, 1010, 7435, 1999, 2624, 13675, 20483, 10264, 102]}, {"score": 0.7642697095870972, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "Informants report experiencing a variety of sensed states as a disease process begins.

Illnesses are unit characterizations of the disease process which are sufficiently contrastive with each other so that alternative strategies for reducing the illness (as a basis of inference and action) are pursued, depending upon which (identified) illness is present in any particular case.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 28694, 2015, 3189, 13417, 1037, 3528, 1997, 10596, 2163, 2004, 1037, 4295, 2832, 4269, 1012, 2426, 2122, 2024, 6245, 1006, 5177, 1007, 1010, 19340, 1010, 4318, 3759, 1010, 22939, 12171, 20192, 1010, 9016, 1010, 24780, 1010, 4308, 12336, 1010, 3279, 1997, 18923, 1010, 18348, 1010, 14978, 1012, 2012, 2023, 2754, 1999, 1996, 4295, 2832, 1010, 2053, 2028, 1010, 2560, 1997, 2035, 1996, 5776, 1010, 4282, 2054, 8973, 1997, 11165, 3197, 1997, 2051, 2097, 2022, 2066, 1012, 2008, 2003, 1010, 1996, 5776, 2089, 2031, 1037, 14978, 1998, 2009, 2097, 10436, 1006, 2008, 2003, 1010, 2053, 2936, 2022, 2988, 1007, 1999, 2070, 11165, 3131, 1997, 2051, 1012, 2006, 1996, 2060, 2192, 1010, 1996, 14978, 2089, 2022, 7328, 2098, 2007, 1037, 4308, 12336, 1999, 2070, 11165, 3131, 1997, 2051, 1010, 4525, 1999, 1037, 2417, 12879, 5498, 3508, 1997, 1996, 4295, 2832, 1012, 3227, 4092, 1010, 10596, 2163, 2029, 5258, 2220, 1999, 1996, 4295, 2832, 1998, 2029, 2024, 2025, 4487, 11365, 7028, 2046, 2060, 10596, 2163, 2024, 5662, 2000, 8030, 1010, 6168, 10596, 2163, 2029, 5258, 2101, 1999, 1996, 4295, 2832, 1998, 2029, 2024, 1037, 7680, 1997, 2060, 10596, 2163, 2089, 2022, 5662, 2000, 24757, 1012, 24757, 2024, 3131, 23191, 2015, 1997, 1996, 4295, 2832, 2029, 2024, 12949, 5688, 3512, 2007, 2169, 2060, 2061, 2008, 4522, 9942, 2005, 8161, 1996, 7355, 1006, 2004, 1037, 3978, 1997, 28937, 1998, 2895, 1007, 2024, 9505, 1010, 5834, 2588, 2029, 1006, 4453, 1007, 7355, 2003, 2556, 1999, 2151, 3327, 2553, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9107065200805664, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "It is at present still unclear to what degree well-defined illnesses such as /SAK OBAL/ \u201ctuberculosis\u201d are defined strictly in terms of combinations of symptoms appearing through the disease process rather than in combination with the manner in which the disease process responds to the sequential curing segments, and the ultimate explanations assigned to the disease process (e.g., witchcraft).

In addition, they deal with illnesses in sufficiently contrastive ways so that two role identifying labels must be maintained. They are both recognized to be able to reduce illness (as a basis for further inference and action) by prescribing medicines that can be purchased in the pharmacy. These may be taken orally, injected, or applied as a salve. The doctor further prescribes and may himself perform some minor surgery, X-ray examinations, and other traditional Western-European strategies for diagnosing and reducing illness. The curer does not engage in surgery, nor does he prescribe any of the more complex testing procedures whose results he does not imagine himself to be able to interpret. Instead, he recommends additional substances he purchased from the pharmacy such as tallow, wines, herbs in aguardientes as well as substances which are sometimes found in domesticated state, and more often found wild in the general vicinity of Aguacatenango. These include some kinds of flowers, bark, leaves, roots, stems, flesh of animals and fishes, animal waste products, eggs and so on. These substances are variously taken orally, applied externally, or inhaled as steam. Unlike doctors, curers practice bleeding and cupping; they also administer some medications in the form of steam while the patient is seated on a platform over a fire. They incorporate adornment of the sick-bed into curing ritual. The ritual may also include prayer. Most important, perhaps, the curers undertake to examine the recent life history of the individual who is ill, in terms of the possibility that the individual has encountered some disease producing entity which can explain, in his particular case, the onset of the disease process. There is no illness for which the curer does not have an explanation together with a set of strategies for dealing with it. At present, at least one curer, when confronted with very serious cases, will refer his patient to a doctor, but this does not yet appear to be a popular alternative. Generally, the doctor is the last of all medical practitioners referred to in exhausting the curing options in Aguacatenango, though individuals who have had a successful relationship with the doctor are more likely to pursue that option sooner. The only other major class of medical practitioners is the talking saint. Talking saints are more or less representational images of saints who, in conjunction with their \u201cowners\u201d can actively consult with human beings about their trials and tribulations in the world. The most powerful of this class, San Miguel of Soyal\u00f3, is about an eight hour trip and a 200 peso fee from Aguacatenango. Talking saints share more features with the curers than they do with doctors. They, like the curers, are predestined by God to their role, but they more directly represent God's omniscience. The cure of the talking sai it is more powerful as can be measured by the greater expenditure of funds for such a cure, or as can be measured by his greater ability to divine in the life history of the patient the principal sources of illness.", "predicted_label": 0, "input_ids": [101, 9526, 2869, 1998, 7435, 11234, 2087, 5525, 1999, 2008, 7435, 2024, 14804, 5740, 2015, 1998, 9526, 2869, 7166, 2000, 2022, 6505, 1006, 2348, 14804, 5740, 9526, 2869, 2024, 2124, 1007, 1012, 1999, 2804, 1010, 2027, 3066, 2007, 24757, 1999, 12949, 5688, 3512, 3971, 2061, 2008, 2048, 2535, 12151, 10873, 2442, 2022, 5224, 1012, 2027, 2024, 2119, 3858, 2000, 2022, 2583, 2000, 5547, 7355, 1006, 2004, 1037, 3978, 2005, 2582, 28937, 1998, 2895, 1007, 2011, 3653, 11020, 3089, 10472, 20233, 2008, 2064, 2022, 4156, 1999, 1996, 13882, 1012, 2122, 2089, 2022, 2579, 8700, 2135, 1010, 19737, 1010, 2030, 4162, 2004, 1037, 16183, 3726, 1012, 1996, 3460, 2582, 3653, 29234, 2015, 1998, 2089, 2370, 4685, 2070, 3576, 5970, 1010, 1060, 1011, 4097, 14912, 1010, 1998, 2060, 3151, 2530, 1011, 2647, 9942, 2005, 22939, 26745, 7741, 1998, 8161, 7355, 1012, 1996, 9526, 2099, 2515, 2025, 8526, 1999, 5970, 1010, 4496, 2515, 2002, 3653, 29234, 2151, 1997, 1996, 2062, 3375, 5604, 8853, 3005, 3463, 2002, 2515, 2025, 5674, 2370, 2000, 2022, 2583, 2000, 17841, 1012, 2612, 1010, 2002, 26021, 3176, 13978, 2002, 4156, 2013, 1996, 13882, 2107, 2004, 4206, 5004, 1010, 14746, 1010, 17561, 1999, 12943, 6692, 17080, 26933, 2004, 2092, 2004, 13978, 2029, 2024, 2823, 2179, 1999, 4968, 4383, 2110, 1010, 1998, 2062, 2411, 2179, 3748, 1999, 1996, 2236, 9884, 1997, 12943, 6692, 16280, 7229, 3995, 1012, 2122, 2421, 2070, 7957, 1997, 4870, 1010, 11286, 1010, 3727, 1010, 6147, 1010, 12402, 1010, 5771, 1997, 4176, 1998, 21995, 1010, 4111, 5949, 3688, 1010, 6763, 1998, 2061, 2006, 1012, 2122, 13978, 2024, 17611, 2579, 8700, 2135, 1010, 4162, 27223, 1010, 2030, 15938, 2004, 5492, 1012, 4406, 7435, 1010, 9526, 2869, 3218, 9524, 1998, 25076, 1025, 2027, 2036, 21497, 2070, 20992, 1999, 1996, 2433, 1997, 5492, 2096, 1996, 5776, 2003, 8901, 2006, 1037, 4132, 2058, 1037, 2543, 1012, 2027, 13265, 4748, 9691, 3672, 1997, 1996, 5305, 1011, 2793, 2046, 12731, 4892, 8887, 1012, 1996, 8887, 2089, 2036, 2421, 7083, 1012, 2087, 2590, 1010, 3383, 1010, 1996, 9526, 2869, 16617, 2000, 11628, 1996, 3522, 2166, 2381, 1997, 1996, 3265, 2040, 2003, 5665, 1010, 1999, 3408, 1997, 1996, 6061, 2008, 1996, 3265, 2038, 8567, 2070, 4295, 5155, 9178, 2029, 2064, 4863, 1010, 1999, 2010, 3327, 2553, 1010, 1996, 14447, 1997, 1996, 4295, 2832, 1012, 2045, 2003, 2053, 7355, 2005, 2029, 1996, 9526, 2099, 2515, 2025, 2031, 2019, 7526, 2362, 2007, 1037, 2275, 1997, 9942, 2005, 7149, 2007, 2009, 1012, 2012, 2556, 1010, 2012, 2560, 2028, 9526, 2099, 1010, 2043, 12892, 2007, 2200, 3809, 3572, 1010, 2097, 6523, 2010, 5776, 2000, 1037, 3460, 1010, 2021, 2023, 2515, 2025, 2664, 3711, 2000, 2022, 1037, 2759, 4522, 1012, 3227, 1010, 1996, 3460, 2003, 1996, 2197, 1997, 2035, 2966, 14617, 3615, 2000, 1999, 15095, 2075, 1996, 12731, 4892, 7047, 1999, 12943, 6692, 16280, 7229, 3995, 1010, 2295, 3633, 2040, 2031, 2018, 1037, 3144, 3276, 2007, 1996, 3460, 2024, 2062, 3497, 2000, 7323, 2008, 5724, 10076, 1012, 1996, 2069, 2060, 2350, 2465, 1997, 2966, 14617, 2003, 1996, 3331, 3002, 1012, 3331, 6586, 2024, 2062, 2030, 2625, 6630, 2389, 4871, 1997, 6586, 2040, 1010, 102]}, {"score": 0.9165672659873962, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Informants report that drinking may result in illness.

This may be associated with the fact that the membership of the drinking group in Aguacatenango is least well defined and hence the one where enemies are most likely to be encountered. Likewise it is the one in which aggressive performances are most likely to occur. 1 This interpretation would have it that aguardiente becomes a physical medium by means of which the anger of the witch is transmitted to his target. Most aguardiente I have drunk has swirling hair in it; so foreign substance is not uncommon and thus available for potential interpretation. To restate the matter slightly, we may say: there is a language of aguardiente which depends upon the visual cues in examining the liquid. It is a one information bit language. The bit reads: If the aguardiente is clear when one is offered a drink, drink it and thank the drinker. If the aguardiente is \u201cswirling-hairful,\u201d and one is offered a drink, break the glass or bottle and beat the offerer up.

(The ceremonial drinking plus one or more adjacent informal drinking units.) We will now review a few of the disease processes which are interpreted as beginning immediately adjacent to drinking performances. The most common illness that results from drinking is a state that may be glossed as a \u201changover\u201d /GOMA, XCAMEL YUUN TRAWO/. This is a minor illness which involves the symptoms of \u201cheadache, loss of appetite, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, trembling,\u201d the response to which is selected from the following alternative set. The condition of GOMA is nearly exclusive with the ability to engage in routine agricultural performances. This means that the day after a ceremonial drinking plus informal drinking segment, a man does not work. He has the choice, then, of staying around the house or leaving the house to perform some minor tasks such as gathering poles to support chayote vines, looking at his cattle, or any other task that takes him out of the household setting. This is an important distinction since if a man stays around the house he increases the probability that he will continue drinking by some considerable degree. The confusion of setting with cure for GOMA is further reduced if we consider the specific remedies which are employed. Aguardiente is a \u201chot\u201d substance. This \u201cheat\u201d causes the illness, and the illness can be reduced by drinking remedies which are \u201ccool\u201d or \u201ccold.\u201d Coca cola is such a remedy. A man may stay around the house and drink coca cola by way of reducing the GOMA. A second remedy for reducing a hangover is to drink as much as onehalf a pint of aguardiente. This is the Tzeltal equivalent to the \u201chair of the dog\u201d response. Drinking a small amount of aguardiente and staying around the house are the two conditions which make it most likely that the man will continue drinking that day. Drinking coca cola and staying around the house make it slightly less likely that a man will drink on that day. Finally, drinking either aguardiente or coca cola and leaving the house to perform some minor task makes it less and less probable that a man will go on drinking that day. These observations are relevant to an interpretation of the cure for a hangover since they clearly include alternative plans for furth action which either produce further hangovers or do not. In other words, if one wishes to cure a hangover and go on drinkin he drinks aguardiente and stays in his house where his previous day's drinking companions will be sure to find him. If, on the other hand, one wishes to stop drinking, he will drink coca cola and leave the house.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2025, 2069, 2515, 12943, 6692, 17080, 15781, 1999, 2070, 18046, 3710, 2004, 5396, 2011, 2965, 1997, 2029, 21599, 2064, 2022, 24162, 1010, 2021, 2036, 2009, 2038, 1037, 3056, 4295, 5155, 4022, 1997, 2049, 2219, 2043, 2009, 2003, 2579, 1999, 3056, 8310, 2306, 1037, 3056, 2051, 2558, 1012, 1006, 1996, 12961, 5948, 4606, 2028, 2030, 2062, 5516, 11900, 5948, 3197, 1012, 1007, 2057, 2097, 2085, 3319, 1037, 2261, 1997, 1996, 4295, 6194, 2029, 2024, 10009, 2004, 2927, 3202, 5516, 2000, 5948, 4616, 1012, 1996, 2087, 2691, 7355, 2008, 3463, 2013, 5948, 2003, 1037, 2110, 2008, 2089, 2022, 27068, 2098, 2004, 1037, 1523, 6865, 7840, 1524, 1013, 2175, 2863, 1010, 1060, 28727, 2884, 9805, 4609, 19817, 10376, 2080, 1013, 1012, 2023, 2003, 1037, 3576, 7355, 2029, 7336, 1996, 8030, 1997, 1523, 14978, 1010, 3279, 1997, 18923, 1010, 2139, 10536, 7265, 3508, 1010, 24780, 1010, 22939, 12171, 20192, 1010, 10226, 1010, 1524, 1996, 3433, 2000, 2029, 2003, 3479, 2013, 1996, 2206, 4522, 2275, 1012, 1996, 4650, 1997, 2175, 2863, 2003, 3053, 7262, 2007, 1996, 3754, 2000, 8526, 1999, 9410, 4910, 4616, 1012, 2023, 2965, 2008, 1996, 2154, 2044, 1037, 12961, 5948, 4606, 11900, 5948, 6903, 1010, 1037, 2158, 2515, 2025, 2147, 1012, 2002, 2038, 1996, 3601, 1010, 2059, 1010, 1997, 6595, 2105, 1996, 2160, 2030, 2975, 1996, 2160, 2000, 4685, 2070, 3576, 8518, 2107, 2004, 7215, 10567, 2000, 2490, 15775, 7677, 2618, 16702, 1010, 2559, 2012, 2010, 7125, 1010, 2030, 2151, 2060, 4708, 2008, 3138, 2032, 2041, 1997, 1996, 4398, 4292, 1012, 2023, 2003, 2019, 2590, 7835, 2144, 2065, 1037, 2158, 12237, 2105, 1996, 2160, 2002, 7457, 1996, 9723, 2008, 2002, 2097, 3613, 5948, 2011, 2070, 6196, 3014, 1012, 1996, 6724, 1997, 4292, 2007, 9526, 2005, 2175, 2863, 2003, 2582, 4359, 2065, 2057, 5136, 1996, 3563, 2128, 7583, 3111, 2029, 2024, 4846, 1012, 12943, 6692, 17080, 15781, 2003, 1037, 1523, 2980, 1524, 9415, 1012, 2023, 1523, 3684, 1524, 5320, 1996, 7355, 1010, 1998, 1996, 7355, 2064, 2022, 4359, 2011, 5948, 2128, 7583, 3111, 2029, 2024, 1523, 4658, 1524, 2030, 1523, 3147, 1012, 1524, 16787, 15270, 2003, 2107, 1037, 19519, 1012, 1037, 2158, 2089, 2994, 2105, 1996, 2160, 1998, 4392, 16787, 15270, 2011, 2126, 1997, 8161, 1996, 2175, 2863, 1012, 1037, 2117, 19519, 2005, 8161, 1037, 6865, 7840, 2003, 2000, 4392, 2004, 2172, 2004, 2028, 8865, 2546, 1037, 9231, 2102, 1997, 12943, 6692, 17080, 15781, 1012, 2023, 2003, 1996, 1056, 12638, 9080, 5662, 2000, 1996, 1523, 2606, 1997, 1996, 3899, 1524, 3433, 1012, 5948, 1037, 2235, 3815, 1997, 12943, 6692, 17080, 15781, 1998, 6595, 2105, 1996, 2160, 2024, 1996, 2048, 3785, 2029, 2191, 2009, 2087, 3497, 2008, 1996, 2158, 2097, 3613, 5948, 2008, 2154, 1012, 5948, 16787, 15270, 1998, 6595, 2105, 1996, 2160, 2191, 2009, 3621, 2625, 3497, 2008, 1037, 2158, 2097, 4392, 2006, 2008, 2154, 1012, 2633, 1010, 5948, 2593, 12943, 6692, 17080, 15781, 2030, 16787, 15270, 1998, 2975, 1996, 2160, 2000, 4685, 2070, 3576, 4708, 3084, 2009, 2625, 1998, 2625, 15596, 2008, 1037, 2158, 2097, 2175, 2006, 5948, 2008, 2154, 1012, 2122, 9420, 2024, 7882, 2000, 2019, 7613, 1997, 1996, 9526, 2005, 102]}, {"score": 0.8464651107788086, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Normally, a cure for a hangover, if it is not followed by more drinking, is successful in a one day time period.

In turn, the drinking of aguardiente is interpreted as a disease process to the extent that individuals take \u201cmedicine\u201d to reduce the number of occasions upon which they drink. The text citations which have been inserted above are suggestive of these points. By way of summing up this section, I would like to offer a less easily verifiable interpretation which provides still further context in terms of which the reader can think about the drinking performances in Aguacatenango. The first simple set of observations is as follows: Men drink and women don't. Some men drink more than others but all men must drink some. Some men would prefer to drink less than they do. Drinking settings for some men, especially under the informal drinking rules, are settings in which some considerable hostility is expressed. Suppose we take the case of the man who wishes to drink less. He can achieve this end in the short run by either drinking more or not drinking at all. He knows that he will not be able to completely terminate his drinking performances (the ceremonial drinking performances) until he is an old man. Ceremonial drinking performances are required of all men. He can, however, reduce the number of informal drinking performances. If a man wants to reduce the number of informal drinking performances, then, he can do so by increasing the average length of any particular informal drinking performance. Increasing the length of an informal drinking performance increases the probability that the individual will become ill (as well as exhaust all his resources, anger the members of his household, and so on). Upon the next occasion when some individual invites him to start an informal drinking performance, he can respond by saying, \u201cI am afraid to start an informal drinking performance with you since my style of informal drinking performance results for me in severe illness, alienates my family, causes economic catastrophe to my household.\u201d The person inviting must allow that this is true, in view of the fact that he observed ego engaging in such extended performances within the past year, say. On the other hand, an individual can stop engaging in informal drinking performances by reporting that he has taken medicine for drinking, which medicine will cause his death if he drinks. It is not unusual for a man to take medicine and then become very sick by way of telling the community that it was real medicine with strong disease producing effects. If a man goes on drinking in the informal drinking after he has taken the medicine, it is proof that the medicine did not have the desired effect. The common feature of either response to the desire to reduce amount of drinking: increasing the length of the informal drinking performances or taking medicine puts the individual in that context which allows him to say, \u201cIf I drink I will die.\u201d We believe that it is only by citing such severe effects as this that an individual can, over the long run, control his response to the invitation to drink. 1 In the short run, a man can avoid any particular, highly probable informal drinking performance by leaving the field, as was suggested above. That is, by knowing which days informal drinking performances are more likely to occur on than other days (the ten day time zone around some major fiesta, or Sundays, for example), he can arrange to be \u201caway on business.\u201d", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 12943, 6692, 17080, 15781, 2003, 7355, 1011, 5155, 2593, 3495, 2138, 1997, 2049, 9415, 1010, 2030, 12613, 3973, 2138, 2009, 2003, 2028, 1997, 1996, 2865, 2011, 2965, 1997, 2029, 1037, 6965, 5320, 2010, 6778, 2000, 13749, 4355, 22641, 13978, 1012, 1999, 2735, 1010, 1996, 5948, 1997, 12943, 6692, 17080, 15781, 2003, 10009, 2004, 1037, 4295, 2832, 2000, 1996, 6698, 2008, 3633, 2202, 1523, 4200, 1524, 2000, 5547, 1996, 2193, 1997, 6642, 2588, 2029, 2027, 4392, 1012, 1996, 3793, 22921, 2029, 2031, 2042, 12889, 2682, 2024, 6592, 3512, 1997, 2122, 2685, 1012, 2011, 2126, 1997, 7680, 6562, 2039, 2023, 2930, 1010, 1045, 2052, 2066, 2000, 3749, 1037, 2625, 4089, 2310, 3089, 22749, 3468, 7613, 2029, 3640, 2145, 2582, 6123, 1999, 3408, 1997, 2029, 1996, 8068, 2064, 2228, 2055, 1996, 5948, 4616, 1999, 12943, 6692, 16280, 7229, 3995, 1012, 1996, 2034, 3722, 2275, 1997, 9420, 2003, 2004, 4076, 1024, 2273, 4392, 1998, 2308, 2123, 1005, 1056, 1012, 2070, 2273, 4392, 2062, 2084, 2500, 2021, 2035, 2273, 2442, 4392, 2070, 1012, 2070, 2273, 2052, 9544, 2000, 4392, 2625, 2084, 2027, 2079, 1012, 5948, 10906, 2005, 2070, 2273, 1010, 2926, 2104, 1996, 11900, 5948, 3513, 1010, 2024, 10906, 1999, 2029, 2070, 6196, 18258, 2003, 5228, 1012, 6814, 2057, 2202, 1996, 2553, 1997, 1996, 2158, 2040, 8996, 2000, 4392, 2625, 1012, 2002, 2064, 6162, 2023, 2203, 1999, 1996, 2460, 2448, 2011, 2593, 5948, 2062, 2030, 2025, 5948, 2012, 2035, 1012, 2002, 4282, 2008, 2002, 2097, 2025, 2022, 2583, 2000, 3294, 20320, 2010, 5948, 4616, 1006, 1996, 12961, 5948, 4616, 1007, 2127, 2002, 2003, 2019, 2214, 2158, 1012, 12961, 5948, 4616, 2024, 3223, 1997, 2035, 2273, 1012, 2002, 2064, 1010, 2174, 1010, 5547, 1996, 2193, 1997, 11900, 5948, 4616, 1012, 2065, 1037, 2158, 4122, 2000, 5547, 1996, 2193, 1997, 11900, 5948, 4616, 1010, 2059, 1010, 2002, 2064, 2079, 2061, 2011, 4852, 1996, 2779, 3091, 1997, 2151, 3327, 11900, 5948, 2836, 1012, 4852, 1996, 3091, 1997, 2019, 11900, 5948, 2836, 7457, 1996, 9723, 2008, 1996, 3265, 2097, 2468, 5665, 1006, 2004, 2092, 2004, 15095, 2035, 2010, 4219, 1010, 4963, 1996, 2372, 1997, 2010, 4398, 1010, 1998, 2061, 2006, 1007, 1012, 2588, 1996, 2279, 6686, 2043, 2070, 3265, 18675, 2032, 2000, 2707, 2019, 11900, 5948, 2836, 1010, 2002, 2064, 6869, 2011, 3038, 1010, 1523, 1045, 2572, 4452, 2000, 2707, 2019, 11900, 5948, 2836, 2007, 2017, 2144, 2026, 2806, 1997, 11900, 5948, 2836, 3463, 2005, 2033, 1999, 5729, 7355, 1010, 7344, 8520, 2026, 2155, 1010, 5320, 3171, 25539, 2000, 2026, 4398, 1012, 1524, 1996, 2711, 15085, 2442, 3499, 2008, 2023, 2003, 2995, 1010, 1999, 3193, 1997, 1996, 2755, 2008, 2002, 5159, 13059, 11973, 1999, 2107, 3668, 4616, 2306, 1996, 2627, 2095, 1010, 2360, 1012, 2006, 1996, 2060, 2192, 1010, 2019, 3265, 2064, 2644, 11973, 1999, 11900, 5948, 4616, 2011, 7316, 2008, 2002, 2038, 2579, 4200, 2005, 5948, 1010, 2029, 4200, 2097, 3426, 2010, 2331, 2065, 2002, 8974, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2025, 5866, 2005, 1037, 2158, 2000, 2202, 4200, 1998, 2059, 2468, 2200, 5305, 2011, 2126, 1997, 4129, 1996, 2451, 2008, 2009, 2001, 2613, 4200, 2007, 2844, 4295, 5155, 3896, 102]}, {"score": 0.737987220287323, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Some men prefer to drink more in the informal drinking performances than do most men.

If not, she can well meet a strange man on the road, and get sick from verguenza (sickness assumed to originate from shame at being placed in an anomalous or embarrassing social situation) or espanto (fear and soul loss).", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 4145, 1997, 2702, 2121, 10514, 4012, 26569, 2050, 3216, 2802, 2035, 4023, 1010, 2012, 2035, 5535, 1012, 2383, 2194, 2965, 3860, 2013, 1996, 11189, 2006, 1037, 2146, 4440, 1010, 2393, 2105, 1996, 2160, 1010, 25546, 6313, 2591, 4262, 2007, 2287, 14711, 1998, 12631, 6491, 2368, 1010, 1998, 5427, 2114, 20334, 1012, 3080, 2308, 2040, 2024, 2187, 2894, 1999, 1037, 2160, 2005, 2195, 2420, 2097, 1523, 17781, 1524, 1037, 3920, 2611, 1010, 1037, 2365, 1005, 1055, 2684, 2005, 2742, 1010, 2000, 2562, 2068, 2194, 1010, 1998, 1037, 2402, 2564, 2183, 2000, 3006, 2030, 2000, 2131, 2543, 3702, 2003, 2788, 3517, 2000, 2424, 2194, 2000, 2079, 2061, 1012, 2065, 2025, 1010, 2016, 2064, 2092, 3113, 1037, 4326, 2158, 2006, 1996, 2346, 1010, 1998, 2131, 5305, 2013, 2310, 10623, 24997, 4143, 1006, 15556, 5071, 2000, 21754, 2013, 9467, 2012, 2108, 2872, 1999, 2019, 2019, 9626, 15534, 2030, 16436, 2591, 3663, 1007, 2030, 9686, 9739, 3406, 1006, 3571, 1998, 3969, 3279, 1007, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9640457034111023, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Even more significant is the house ritual connected with the sickness of a person who lives in it.

But as a matter of fact, the king\u2019s illness originated from another cause: One day his wife Nantuze was cultivating in Ensiike when she saw a leopard and raised an alarm. When the king ran to her help, he fell, and this caused his chronic cough and other diseases. Other people, however, alleged that because Sewankambo had dragged the canoes overland and had thereby broken the back of the god Mukasa, he was responsible for the king\u2019s illness. Hence, as soon as his adversaries heard that Sewankambo was returning from his campaign in Bukedi, they built a small hut at Mamunyi village in Bulemeezi and argued: \u201cIf Sewankambo walks through it, the king will recover and with his recovery, Sewankambo himself will catch the disease and die.\u201d Thus when Sewankambo arrived, the chiefs lied and told him: \u201cThe king commanded you to walk through this hut before you reach the capital.\u201d Knowing the jealousy which his fellow chiefs had for him, Sewankambo suspected at once that there was a conspiracy against him and he refused to walk through the hut.

Mukasa was the most important of the Baganda gods, and he was also the chief adviser of the kings in all matters except military. These were reserved for the gods Kibuuka and Nnende. Like many other Baganda gods, Mukasa was one of Bukulu\u2019s descendants, and his principal shrine was on Bukasa island. As the \u201cNeptune\u201d of the Baganda, Mukasa was thought to be grievously offended when canoes were hauled overland, which implied that his property had been taken out of its watery domain.

But because of his riches, power and influence, his fellow and jealous chiefs slandered him and this led to his fall.

Kings Tebandeke, Kamaanya and Mutesa I\u2019s illnesses may be quoted as examples.

They were, perhaps, based on a misinterpretation. The Kabaka led the nation in supporting the gods and supplied them lavishly with gifts of tribute, but he did not control them or their cult, as some kings painfully learned. The Kabaka\u2019s obligatory gifts to the gods indicate a relation of asymmetrical exchange (cf. Kenny 1988: 604). Upon accession, the Kabaka rebuilt the lubaale temples and presented the gods with large endowments of women, slaves, cattle, goats, and cowrie shells in multiples of the sacred number nine. The gods, in turn, exhorted the new king to \u201calways love the gods\u201d and gave him their blessing (Kaggwa [1907] 1934: 21). Every year, the Kabaka made new presentations to the gods to secure those blessings. He also gave a large number of human victims to the war god Kibuuka whenever Kibuuka\u2019s temple was rebuilt. While responsible for the upkeep of the country\u2019s major shrines, the Kabakas never oversaw the worship of the lubaale or governed the priests. On the contrary, when the Kabakas refused to take priestly advice and proceeded to kill the priests and loot their temples, the chronicles say that the lubaale were quick to take revenge. They set illnesses and other afflictions upon the Kabakas in order to put them in their place. In the nineteenth century, the priests of Mukasa regarded Mutesa I as their \u201cson-in-law\u201d (Roscoe 1911: 298), even their \u201cslave\u201d (Ashe 1895: 102n.), a relationship that indicated his subordinate status. The chronicles also report that Mukasa\u2019s priests generally succeeded in forcing Mutesa I to do their will. To be sure, Mutesa\u2019s father, Ssuuna II, is said to have boasted that he was the lubaale on earth because he could with impunity plunder the temples of the lubaale of the sky (Roscoe and Kaggwa 1906: 50; Burton [1860] 1961 II: 191). But even the powerful Ssuuna was unable to force the gods to do his bidding. The dynastic accounts say that Ssuuna was struck by lightning sent by lubaale Kiwanuka because he mistreated one of Kiwanuka\u2019s priests (Kaggwa [1901] 1971: 119). Ssuuna is also said to have died of smallpox because he disobeyed the warnings of the priest of the war god Nnende (Nsimbi 1956b: 134). When Mutesa was ill in 1879, the priest of Mukasa attributed the malady to Mutesa\u2019s political ambition, which offended Mukasa. Mutesa was thus forced to return the powerful chieftainship of the Mugema to its rightful possessors, the Vervet Monkey clan (Rowe 1967: 154-56; Kaggwa [1901] 1971: 176). As Roscoe himself noted, the temple priesthoods were appointed by the clan heads ( Bataka ), and although it was necessary for the king to ratify priestly appointments, the priesthoods tended to support clan interests (Wright 1971: 4). Even though the king might summon the priest of the war god Kibuuka to the capital, the god could refuse to let him go and the priest would stay at home (Kaggwa [1907] 1934: 222). Kaggwa also notes that Kibuuka was treated like a Kabaka, and his seat was called Nnamulondo, which was the name of the king\u2019s enthronement stool. It was pointed out to me that ever since Tebandeke, the eighteenth Kabaka, who became a priest of Mukasa while on the throne, there was an institutional incompatibility between the Kabakaship and the priests, and the two could never be combined (cf. Kaggwa [1901] 1971: 56-59).", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2119, 2122, 8635, 2024, 16542, 1012, 2027, 2020, 1010, 3383, 1010, 2241, 2006, 1037, 28616, 18447, 2121, 28139, 12516, 1012, 1996, 10556, 3676, 2912, 2419, 1996, 3842, 1999, 4637, 1996, 5932, 1998, 8127, 2068, 22689, 2135, 2007, 9604, 1997, 7050, 1010, 2021, 2002, 2106, 2025, 2491, 2068, 2030, 2037, 8754, 1010, 2004, 2070, 5465, 16267, 4342, 1012, 1996, 10556, 3676, 2912, 1521, 1055, 26471, 9604, 2000, 1996, 5932, 5769, 1037, 7189, 1997, 2004, 24335, 12589, 2389, 3863, 1006, 12935, 1012, 8888, 2997, 1024, 3438, 2549, 1007, 1012, 2588, 16993, 1010, 1996, 10556, 3676, 2912, 7183, 1996, 11320, 3676, 9453, 8436, 1998, 3591, 1996, 5932, 2007, 2312, 15108, 2015, 1997, 2308, 1010, 7179, 1010, 7125, 1010, 17977, 1010, 1998, 11190, 7373, 10986, 1999, 3674, 2015, 1997, 1996, 6730, 2193, 3157, 1012, 1996, 5932, 1010, 1999, 2735, 1010, 4654, 27794, 2098, 1996, 2047, 2332, 2000, 1523, 2467, 2293, 1996, 5932, 1524, 1998, 2435, 2032, 2037, 13301, 1006, 10556, 13871, 4213, 1031, 5528, 1033, 4579, 1024, 2538, 1007, 1012, 2296, 2095, 1010, 1996, 10556, 3676, 2912, 2081, 2047, 18216, 2000, 1996, 5932, 2000, 5851, 2216, 24618, 1012, 2002, 2036, 2435, 1037, 2312, 2193, 1997, 2529, 5694, 2000, 1996, 2162, 2643, 11382, 8569, 15750, 7188, 11382, 8569, 15750, 1521, 1055, 3379, 2001, 7183, 1012, 2096, 3625, 2005, 1996, 2039, 20553, 2361, 1997, 1996, 2406, 1521, 1055, 2350, 22562, 1010, 1996, 10556, 3676, 13716, 2196, 14105, 1996, 7425, 1997, 1996, 11320, 3676, 9453, 2030, 9950, 1996, 8656, 1012, 2006, 1996, 10043, 1010, 2043, 1996, 10556, 3676, 13716, 4188, 2000, 2202, 5011, 2135, 6040, 1998, 8979, 2000, 3102, 1996, 8656, 1998, 8840, 4140, 2037, 8436, 1010, 1996, 11906, 2360, 2008, 1996, 11320, 3676, 9453, 2020, 4248, 2000, 2202, 7195, 1012, 2027, 2275, 24757, 1998, 2060, 21358, 29301, 8496, 2588, 1996, 10556, 3676, 13716, 1999, 2344, 2000, 2404, 2068, 1999, 2037, 2173, 1012, 1999, 1996, 9137, 2301, 1010, 1996, 8656, 1997, 14163, 13716, 2050, 5240, 20101, 3736, 1045, 2004, 2037, 1523, 2365, 1011, 1999, 1011, 2375, 1524, 1006, 20996, 28147, 5184, 1024, 27240, 1007, 1010, 2130, 2037, 1523, 6658, 1524, 1006, 13402, 6301, 1024, 9402, 2078, 1012, 1007, 1010, 1037, 3276, 2008, 5393, 2010, 15144, 3570, 1012, 1996, 11906, 2036, 3189, 2008, 14163, 13716, 2050, 1521, 1055, 8656, 3227, 4594, 1999, 6932, 20101, 3736, 1045, 2000, 2079, 2037, 2097, 1012, 2000, 2022, 2469, 1010, 20101, 3736, 1521, 1055, 2269, 1010, 7020, 2226, 9521, 2462, 1010, 2003, 2056, 2000, 2031, 23390, 2008, 2002, 2001, 1996, 11320, 3676, 9453, 2006, 3011, 2138, 2002, 2071, 2007, 17727, 19496, 3723, 20228, 20824, 1996, 8436, 1997, 1996, 11320, 3676, 9453, 1997, 1996, 3712, 1006, 20996, 28147, 1998, 10556, 13871, 4213, 5518, 1024, 2753, 1025, 9658, 1031, 7313, 1033, 3777, 2462, 1024, 19871, 1007, 1012, 2021, 2130, 1996, 3928, 7020, 2226, 9521, 2001, 4039, 2000, 2486, 1996, 5932, 2000, 2079, 2010, 17534, 1012, 1996, 1040, 18279, 10074, 6115, 2360, 2008, 7020, 2226, 9521, 2001, 4930, 2011, 7407, 2741, 2011, 11320, 3676, 9453, 11382, 7447, 15750, 2138, 2002, 11094, 29313, 2094, 2028, 1997, 11382, 7447, 15750, 1521, 1055, 8656, 1006, 10556, 13871, 4213, 1031, 102]}, {"score": 0.9628332853317261, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Unfortunately, Kaggwa\u2019s account does not say how Nankere\u2019s son was dressed, although Kakoma\u2019s more recent description says that he was dressed as a bride ( mugole ) (1959: 16). Kaggwa explains that the ceremony originated during the reign of one of the early kings, Kabaka Ttembo. Ttembo fell ill and became violently insane ( eddalu ). This type of illness is not uncommon in Buganda today, and it is greatly feared because of its intensity. Eddalu is one of several \u201cstrong\u201d maladies that are said to be sent by human beings (through witchcraft) or by spirits; it is thought to be treatable only by Ganda medicines and is rarely cured (Orley 1970: 4ff). The dynastic accounts say that Ttembo tried several remedies before going to his uncle Nankere, who consulted a doctor.

The egg-shaped container appears to have been made from a lump of barkcloth-covered clay, with cowhide sewn tightly around it. The outside was covered with cowrie shells and beads and decorated with a triangle made of yellow, blue, and red beads.

Ssuuna\u2019s son, Mutesa I, died in 1884 after a prolonged illness, most probably gonorrhea, which was believed to have been sent by the ghost of one of the wives Mutesa had killed (Roscoe 1901: 127). In 1879, Mukasa\u2019s priest had told Mutesa that his illness was the result of his having taken away the powerful office of the Mugema from the Vervet Monkey clan and his having appointed a favorite from the wrong clan to be the guardian of his Twin (Wright 1971: 5). The implication was that Mutesa had become ill because his political ambitions over the clans had offended Mukasa.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2130, 2044, 7367, 2863, 3683, 23212, 3217, 2018, 6464, 8961, 1996, 3218, 1997, 19723, 21752, 1010, 1996, 2331, 1997, 1037, 2332, 2001, 7021, 2011, 2087, 4524, 13832, 2004, 1996, 2765, 1997, 2548, 6905, 1997, 2373, 1010, 1996, 2332, 1521, 1055, 1523, 9594, 6935, 1010, 1524, 2004, 2745, 8888, 3728, 2170, 2009, 1006, 2997, 1007, 1012, 2348, 12000, 2071, 2053, 2936, 8443, 1998, 3102, 1996, 2332, 1010, 5932, 1998, 8633, 2020, 2245, 2000, 16385, 2548, 4078, 11008, 2964, 1012, 2947, 1010, 2429, 2000, 1996, 11906, 1010, 7367, 2863, 3683, 23212, 3217, 2351, 1997, 2019, 7355, 2741, 2011, 1996, 5745, 1997, 1037, 5011, 3183, 2002, 2018, 7129, 1006, 10556, 13871, 4213, 1031, 5775, 1033, 3411, 1024, 2531, 1011, 7886, 1007, 1012, 2010, 6332, 1010, 10556, 3676, 2912, 27829, 14634, 3148, 1010, 2351, 1006, 6187, 1012, 11931, 1007, 2013, 2019, 7355, 7108, 2000, 2119, 24407, 14096, 1998, 1996, 14532, 1997, 1996, 2643, 14163, 13716, 2050, 1006, 10556, 13871, 4213, 1031, 5775, 1033, 3411, 1024, 7287, 1011, 2340, 1007, 1012, 27829, 14634, 3148, 1521, 1055, 2365, 1010, 7020, 2226, 9521, 2462, 1010, 2351, 2105, 8708, 1997, 25765, 2138, 2002, 9382, 4487, 6499, 19182, 2098, 1996, 6040, 1997, 1996, 5011, 1997, 1996, 2162, 2643, 1050, 10224, 3207, 1006, 24978, 5714, 4783, 3838, 2497, 1024, 15170, 1007, 1012, 3041, 1010, 7020, 2226, 9521, 2018, 2042, 4930, 2011, 7407, 9382, 2741, 2011, 1996, 8505, 2643, 11382, 7447, 15750, 2138, 7020, 2226, 9521, 2018, 16999, 2028, 1997, 2010, 8656, 1012, 7020, 2226, 9521, 1521, 1055, 2365, 1010, 20101, 3736, 1045, 1010, 2351, 1999, 6988, 2044, 1037, 15330, 7355, 1010, 2087, 2763, 2175, 12131, 25032, 5243, 1010, 2029, 2001, 3373, 2000, 2031, 2042, 2741, 2011, 1996, 5745, 1997, 2028, 1997, 1996, 10403, 20101, 3736, 2018, 2730, 1006, 20996, 28147, 5775, 1024, 13029, 1007, 1012, 1999, 7449, 1010, 14163, 13716, 2050, 1521, 1055, 5011, 2018, 2409, 20101, 3736, 2008, 2010, 7355, 2001, 1996, 2765, 1997, 2010, 2383, 2579, 2185, 1996, 3928, 2436, 1997, 1996, 14757, 14545, 2013, 1996, 29230, 2102, 10608, 6338, 1998, 2010, 2383, 2805, 1037, 5440, 2013, 1996, 3308, 6338, 2000, 2022, 1996, 6697, 1997, 2010, 5519, 1006, 6119, 3411, 1024, 1019, 1007, 1012, 1996, 25323, 2001, 2008, 20101, 3736, 2018, 2468, 5665, 2138, 2010, 2576, 19509, 2058, 1996, 16411, 2018, 15807, 14163, 13716, 2050, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9489114880561829, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "After the king acceded to the throne, he exercised to its fullest extent the power to kill for the sake of the kingship.

A The King\u2019s sickness. DEATH from natural causes rarely presented itself to the native mind as a feasible explanation for the end of life; illness was much more likely to be the result of malice finding vent in magical art. Death was the outcome of sickness which the skill and art of the medicine-man had failed to overcome. Sometimes the cause of sickness could be traced to the direct influence of a ghost which would not be propitiated: or again it might be that the god Walumbe had need of a person, and accordingly nothing could save him. If we bear these general observations in mind, we shall be better able to understand the customs attending sickness and death, and the treatment of the native by the medicine-man. Any illness of the King was generally attributed to ghosts, because no human being would dare to practise magic upon him; when anything was the matter with him, the whole country was afraid lest he should die, and everyone did what in him lay to hasten his recovery. When the King fell sick, he was said to have a cold (senyiga), and this pretence was kept up during the whole time that his illness lasted, unless it was proved that he had some stomach trouble. All the skill in the land was at his disposal and all the priests of the gods of the land came together to diagnose his disorder. If he died, he was supposed to have offended one of the gods by robbing the temple; or else his death was thought to have been caused by one of the ghosts. The only living people whom the King feared were the widows of his father who had sons whom they wished to see on the throne. Influenced by such fears he made these widows prisoners as soon as he ascended the throne, and kept them in strict confinement until their sons died. This was the former custom, but in more recent times the King was wont to capture all the princes and had them put to death, in order to ensure peace: in the case of King Mutesa his Mother took this step for him, and put the princes to death by starvation.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1037, 5320, 1997, 2331, 1012, 1037, 1996, 2332, 1521, 1055, 15556, 1012, 2331, 2013, 3019, 5320, 6524, 3591, 2993, 2000, 1996, 3128, 2568, 2004, 1037, 22945, 7526, 2005, 1996, 2203, 1997, 2166, 1025, 7355, 2001, 2172, 2062, 3497, 2000, 2022, 1996, 2765, 1997, 28238, 4531, 18834, 1999, 8687, 2396, 1012, 2331, 2001, 1996, 9560, 1997, 15556, 2029, 1996, 8066, 1998, 2396, 1997, 1996, 4200, 1011, 2158, 2018, 3478, 2000, 9462, 1012, 2823, 1996, 3426, 1997, 15556, 2071, 2022, 9551, 2000, 1996, 3622, 3747, 1997, 1037, 5745, 2029, 2052, 2025, 2022, 17678, 29050, 3064, 1024, 2030, 2153, 2009, 2453, 2022, 2008, 1996, 2643, 24547, 25438, 2063, 2018, 2342, 1997, 1037, 2711, 1010, 1998, 11914, 2498, 2071, 3828, 2032, 1012, 2065, 2057, 4562, 2122, 2236, 9420, 1999, 2568, 1010, 2057, 4618, 2022, 2488, 2583, 2000, 3305, 1996, 8205, 7052, 15556, 1998, 2331, 1010, 1998, 1996, 3949, 1997, 1996, 3128, 2011, 1996, 4200, 1011, 2158, 1012, 2151, 7355, 1997, 1996, 2332, 2001, 3227, 7108, 2000, 11277, 1010, 2138, 2053, 2529, 2108, 2052, 8108, 2000, 10975, 18908, 5562, 3894, 2588, 2032, 1025, 2043, 2505, 2001, 1996, 3043, 2007, 2032, 1010, 1996, 2878, 2406, 2001, 4452, 26693, 2002, 2323, 3280, 1010, 1998, 3071, 2106, 2054, 1999, 2032, 3913, 2000, 24748, 2078, 2010, 7233, 1012, 2043, 1996, 2332, 3062, 5305, 1010, 2002, 2001, 2056, 2000, 2031, 1037, 3147, 1006, 12411, 10139, 3654, 1007, 1010, 1998, 2023, 3653, 6528, 3401, 2001, 2921, 2039, 2076, 1996, 2878, 2051, 2008, 2010, 7355, 6354, 1010, 4983, 2009, 2001, 4928, 2008, 2002, 2018, 2070, 4308, 4390, 1012, 2035, 1996, 8066, 1999, 1996, 2455, 2001, 2012, 2010, 13148, 1998, 2035, 1996, 8656, 1997, 1996, 5932, 1997, 1996, 2455, 2234, 2362, 2000, 22939, 26745, 3366, 2010, 8761, 1012, 2065, 2002, 2351, 1010, 2002, 2001, 4011, 2000, 2031, 15807, 2028, 1997, 1996, 5932, 2011, 26211, 2075, 1996, 3379, 1025, 2030, 2842, 2010, 2331, 2001, 2245, 2000, 2031, 2042, 3303, 2011, 2028, 1997, 1996, 11277, 1012, 1996, 2069, 2542, 2111, 3183, 1996, 2332, 8615, 2020, 1996, 24835, 1997, 2010, 2269, 2040, 2018, 4124, 3183, 2027, 6257, 2000, 2156, 2006, 1996, 6106, 1012, 5105, 2011, 2107, 10069, 2002, 2081, 2122, 24835, 5895, 2004, 2574, 2004, 2002, 19644, 1996, 6106, 1010, 1998, 2921, 2068, 1999, 9384, 21551, 2127, 2037, 4124, 2351, 1012, 2023, 2001, 1996, 2280, 7661, 1010, 2021, 1999, 2062, 3522, 2335, 1996, 2332, 2001, 2180, 2102, 2000, 5425, 2035, 1996, 12000, 1998, 2018, 2068, 2404, 2000, 2331, 1010, 1999, 2344, 2000, 5676, 3521, 1024, 1999, 1996, 2553, 1997, 2332, 20101, 3736, 2010, 2388, 2165, 2023, 3357, 2005, 2032, 1010, 1998, 2404, 1996, 12000, 2000, 2331, 2011, 22611, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.963350772857666, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "A Treatment of sickness.

If he was suffering from headache only, the usual remedy was to bleed him, in order to relieve him of the alien matter introduced into his head by means of magic, or by some ghost. When the cup was removed, the blood was poured into a leaf, and examined by the medicine-man, who invariably found something which had been drawn out in the cupping-process to account for the headache. The method of cupping was to apply one, and sometimes two cups, as the case demanded: these were short ends of horns, generally the tips of cows\u2019 horns about three inches long; at the tip a small hole was made, to create a vacuum. The medicine-man shaved the hair from the side of the head, if he meant to cup the head; washed the place with water; took a sharp knife and made a number of scratches or slight incisions; again wetted the place over the scratches, applied the cup to the head, and sucked out the air, having in his mouth a little plug of leaf or grass, which he put into the hole, while still sucking out the air. For headache he usually cupped in two places, one on either side of the head. Cupping was practised for headache, for coughs (when they cupped the lungs on the back), for deep seated abscesses in the arms and legs, and sometimes for pleurisy in the side. The horns were left on the patient, until the medicine-man thought that he had drawn enough blood. In other kinds of illness the medicine-man who threw the pieces of leather 1 See below, pp. 338, 339. was consulted, and prescribed for the patient. A man\u2019s wife was required to send messengers to his clan, to let them know that he was unwell, whereupon some members of the clan would go at once to nurse him. Though the wife was looked upon as head nurse, she dared not be left alone with the patient, lest\u2014in the event of his dying\u2014the members of his clan should bring an accusation against her of having caused his death. The remedies applied were often herbs which skilled medicine-men had found useful, for though a medicine-man worked magic, yet he also administered drugs, and did his utmost to relieve the sick person, and to retain his own reputation as a doctor. In some kinds of illness it was thought advisable to apply a small burning iron, made of three pieces of iron about a quarter of an inch thick and four inches long, which were welded together at one end, and pointed to a spike fitting into a wooden handle, so that it could be put into the fire, and made quite hot, and applied to the place where the pain was. Three blisters were usually made, which were supposed to give relief, and above all to drive out the cause of the pain. For fever the medicine-men administered herbs, which had to be drunk from one of the fetiches; this was said to increase their potency. Phthisis was always said to be caused by the ghost of some ancestor who had died of the complaint, and unless the ghost could be propitiated, it would kill the patient.

A Unfaithfulness on the part of a husband a cause of sickness. A Infants\u2019 sickness. When the patient was said to be possessed by a ghost, it was exorcised by making the patient inhale smoke. Sometimes the entire hut was fumigated with herbs, slowly burned in a pot in the closed house. This was done to smoke out evil influences of any kind. A common cause of sickness was neglect of the graves of ancestors; the ghosts were then angry, and had to be propitiated before the remedies of the medicine-man would be of any avail. Women were often said to suffer because some man had fallen in love with them, had made advances to them which they had repelled, and had then gone away and worked magic on them. Sometimes a husband had been unfaithful, when he should have been keeping a continence-taboo; in such a case the medicine-man took some of the urine from each of the offending parties, mixed with herbs, and rubbed it on the chest of the sick woman, after which the ordinary remedies would avail. Again, a husband might be jealous of his wife because she was admired by a superior chief; in such a case he feared to adopt the usual flogging remedy, and therefore used magic and caused her to fall ill. Infants (it was thought) were born delicate because the mother had eaten some kind of forbidden food prior to the child\u2019s birth, and broken a taboo, and the penalty was visited upon the child in the shape of skin disease (munyu), or swelling in its side (nyonyi). The bones of some bird prescribed by the medicine-man were obtained, and either pounded and mixed with herbs or boiled and given to the child to drink, and this formed the remedy. Sometimes children were troubled by the ghost of the father\u2019s sister; it had to be appeased if possible, and, if that was impossible, it was caught by the medicine-man in a gourd or pot and secured, and taken away to a plot of waste land or drowned in the river. The reason which was assigned for the ghost of an aunt troubling the children was that her brother had neglected to appoint one of their number as the heir and successor to the deceased sister; the ghost accordingly was angry, and caused the children to fall ill. It was the common belief that, as soon as a girl had been appointed as heir, the ghost would cease to trouble the family. Amakiro was another illness common to children caused by the father having had intercourse with one of his other wives before he had completed the taboos with the mother of the child, or by his having committed adultery. Again, if the mother of the child committed adultery, either before the child was born or while she was nursing it, the child would contract this disease. The sickness was characterised by nausea and general debility, which nothing would cure until the guilty persons had confessed their guilt and performed the kukansira 1 See p. 72. ceremony. A woman who was subject to miscarriage was said to have a hot inside, and she had to be treated for it by the medicine-man, or the miscarriage might be the result of adultery. If the husband gave any clothing to his mother or to her sisters and they placed it upon his wife\u2019s bed, it would cause her to fall ill of a sickness called buko . Bubonic plague, which had been known for many years, was more feared than any other sickness. The inhabitants fled from the place at once when it appeared, and sought the aid of the god of plague to stay it. People immediately became alarmed and fled from a place if they found rats dead or dying. Small-pox was also feared, though the patients were seldom isolated; they were treated and nursed in their homes. This disease was generally contracted by men engaged on a war expedition, and was supposed to be caused by the enemy. During his illness the patient was given water in which fish had been boiled to quench his thirst, or water mixed with butter, which kept his throat moist. An egg was rubbed over the eyes daily to prevent him from becoming blind; and when the pox formed, they were pricked with a thorn taken from the tip of the palm leaf, and then wiped with a sponge made from the stem of the plantain.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1037, 4654, 2953, 22987, 2075, 11277, 1012, 1037, 4895, 7011, 8939, 20938, 2006, 1996, 2112, 1997, 1037, 3129, 1037, 3426, 1997, 15556, 1012, 1037, 16725, 1521, 15556, 1012, 2043, 1996, 5776, 2001, 2056, 2000, 2022, 8679, 2011, 1037, 5745, 1010, 2009, 2001, 4654, 2953, 18380, 2094, 2011, 2437, 1996, 5776, 1999, 15238, 5610, 1012, 2823, 1996, 2972, 12570, 2001, 11865, 4328, 11644, 2007, 17561, 1010, 3254, 5296, 1999, 1037, 8962, 1999, 1996, 2701, 2160, 1012, 2023, 2001, 2589, 2000, 5610, 2041, 4763, 8092, 1997, 2151, 2785, 1012, 1037, 2691, 3426, 1997, 15556, 2001, 19046, 1997, 1996, 9729, 1997, 10748, 1025, 1996, 11277, 2020, 2059, 4854, 1010, 1998, 2018, 2000, 2022, 17678, 29050, 3064, 2077, 1996, 2128, 7583, 3111, 1997, 1996, 4200, 1011, 2158, 2052, 2022, 1997, 2151, 24608, 1012, 2308, 2020, 2411, 2056, 2000, 9015, 2138, 2070, 2158, 2018, 5357, 1999, 2293, 2007, 2068, 1010, 2018, 2081, 9849, 2000, 2068, 2029, 2027, 2018, 16360, 21148, 1010, 1998, 2018, 2059, 2908, 2185, 1998, 2499, 3894, 2006, 2068, 1012, 2823, 1037, 3129, 2018, 2042, 4895, 7011, 8939, 3993, 1010, 2043, 2002, 2323, 2031, 2042, 4363, 1037, 9530, 10196, 5897, 1011, 27505, 1025, 1999, 2107, 1037, 2553, 1996, 4200, 1011, 2158, 2165, 2070, 1997, 1996, 17996, 2013, 2169, 1997, 1996, 2125, 18537, 4243, 1010, 3816, 2007, 17561, 1010, 1998, 7503, 2009, 2006, 1996, 3108, 1997, 1996, 5305, 2450, 1010, 2044, 2029, 1996, 6623, 2128, 7583, 3111, 2052, 24608, 1012, 2153, 1010, 1037, 3129, 2453, 2022, 9981, 1997, 2010, 2564, 2138, 2016, 2001, 12749, 2011, 1037, 6020, 2708, 1025, 1999, 2107, 1037, 2553, 2002, 8615, 2000, 11092, 1996, 5156, 13109, 8649, 4726, 19519, 1010, 1998, 3568, 2109, 3894, 1998, 3303, 2014, 2000, 2991, 5665, 1012, 16725, 1006, 2009, 2001, 2245, 1007, 2020, 2141, 10059, 2138, 1996, 2388, 2018, 8828, 2070, 2785, 1997, 10386, 2833, 3188, 2000, 1996, 2775, 1521, 1055, 4182, 1010, 1998, 3714, 1037, 27505, 1010, 1998, 1996, 6531, 2001, 4716, 2588, 1996, 2775, 1999, 1996, 4338, 1997, 3096, 4295, 1006, 14163, 4890, 2226, 1007, 1010, 2030, 18348, 1999, 2049, 2217, 1006, 6396, 16585, 2072, 1007, 1012, 1996, 5944, 1997, 2070, 4743, 16250, 2011, 1996, 4200, 1011, 2158, 2020, 4663, 1010, 1998, 2593, 13750, 1998, 3816, 2007, 17561, 2030, 17020, 1998, 2445, 2000, 1996, 2775, 2000, 4392, 1010, 1998, 2023, 2719, 1996, 19519, 1012, 2823, 2336, 2020, 11587, 2011, 1996, 5745, 1997, 1996, 2269, 1521, 1055, 2905, 1025, 2009, 2018, 2000, 2022, 10439, 25063, 2065, 2825, 1010, 1998, 1010, 2065, 2008, 2001, 5263, 1010, 2009, 2001, 3236, 2011, 1996, 4200, 1011, 2158, 1999, 1037, 2175, 3126, 2094, 2030, 8962, 1998, 7119, 1010, 1998, 2579, 2185, 2000, 1037, 5436, 1997, 5949, 2455, 2030, 12805, 1999, 1996, 2314, 1012, 1996, 3114, 2029, 2001, 4137, 2005, 1996, 5745, 1997, 2019, 5916, 19817, 7140, 9709, 1996, 2336, 2001, 2008, 2014, 2567, 2018, 15486, 2000, 16823, 2028, 1997, 2037, 2193, 2004, 1996, 8215, 1998, 6332, 2000, 1996, 10181, 2905, 1025, 1996, 5745, 11914, 2001, 4854, 1010, 1998, 3303, 1996, 2336, 2000, 2991, 5665, 1012, 2009, 2001, 1996, 2691, 6772, 2008, 1010, 2004, 2574, 2004, 1037, 2611, 2018, 2042, 102]}, {"score": 0.961707353591919, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Slaves were buried on some part of their master\u2019s estate without any ceremony; people feared to throw them out on waste land for wild animals, because the medicine-men stated that sickness and death had been caused by the ghosts of slaves who had been thus neglected.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 7179, 2020, 3950, 2006, 2070, 2112, 1997, 2037, 3040, 1521, 1055, 3776, 2302, 2151, 5103, 1025, 2111, 8615, 2000, 5466, 2068, 2041, 2006, 5949, 2455, 2005, 3748, 4176, 1010, 2138, 1996, 4200, 1011, 2273, 3090, 2008, 15556, 1998, 2331, 2018, 2042, 3303, 2011, 1996, 11277, 1997, 7179, 2040, 2018, 2042, 2947, 15486, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9124833345413208, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "A Roads and their up-keep.

The rivers, owing to the growth in them of papyrus and grass, often formed large swamps, sometimes several miles wide, and it became necessary to make paths of raised earth through them, with bridges thrown over the actual streams. If the streams were too wide for the people to bridge, they had to make a long detour till they could find a place sufficiently narrow to bridge. Sometimes no such place could be found, and then the only thing done was to break down the papyrus stems over their own roots, and so form a precarious bridge. To cross a stream upon this kind of bridge was not always safe for travellers; frequently people lost their footing, and were drowned. In all the larger streams there were currents of water under the roots of the papyrus; so that if a person made a false step, and went down, he was caught by the current, and was almost certain to lose his life, because the roots prevented him from rising to the surface. Such accidents were attributed to the Spirit of the River, and no one attempted to assist a person who had gone under, because it was thought that the Spirit needed him, and would wreak vengeance upon the would-be rescuer.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1037, 4925, 1998, 2037, 2039, 1011, 2562, 1012, 2169, 2212, 1011, 2708, 2018, 2000, 5441, 1999, 2204, 2344, 1037, 2346, 1010, 2070, 2176, 4210, 2898, 1010, 4285, 2013, 1996, 3007, 2000, 2010, 2406, 2835, 1025, 1999, 2070, 12107, 1010, 2004, 1999, 1996, 2553, 1997, 13007, 2226, 1010, 2023, 2346, 2001, 3053, 1037, 3634, 2661, 2146, 1012, 1037, 2708, 1521, 1055, 2406, 1011, 2835, 2001, 2062, 2066, 1037, 2235, 2237, 2084, 1037, 2352, 1010, 2005, 2045, 2002, 2001, 4259, 1010, 2542, 1999, 2307, 2110, 1010, 1998, 2383, 1037, 2312, 17539, 1999, 2029, 2045, 2020, 2411, 5606, 1997, 2308, 1998, 7179, 1012, 1999, 2392, 1997, 2010, 2364, 4211, 1037, 2898, 2686, 2001, 5985, 1010, 9671, 1999, 2946, 2429, 2000, 2010, 4635, 1010, 2021, 2411, 2048, 3634, 4210, 2675, 1025, 2023, 2001, 2921, 2489, 2013, 20777, 2030, 5568, 1012, 1999, 1996, 6941, 1996, 2212, 1011, 2708, 2001, 1996, 4054, 14351, 1010, 1998, 2002, 2018, 2010, 4942, 1011, 9058, 2000, 6509, 2032, 1999, 2667, 3572, 1999, 2037, 4733, 1012, 1996, 4942, 1011, 9058, 2020, 2981, 1997, 1996, 2708, 1999, 20965, 1012, 4029, 1012, 1517, 2437, 1037, 2958, 1998, 2346, 1999, 1037, 11963, 1012, 6605, 2037, 2219, 4664, 1997, 2455, 1025, 2027, 3641, 2037, 2273, 2000, 2147, 2588, 4925, 1010, 2000, 2958, 22722, 1010, 2030, 2000, 3857, 2005, 2068, 1025, 2021, 2027, 2018, 2000, 23363, 2037, 2212, 1011, 2708, 2055, 5609, 7175, 1996, 2110, 1998, 2110, 2147, 1012, 1996, 4942, 1011, 9058, 2020, 2036, 2805, 2011, 1996, 2332, 1998, 2011, 1996, 2473, 1006, 11320, 3211, 3683, 1007, 2000, 2037, 2436, 1010, 1998, 2027, 2071, 2025, 2022, 18298, 3272, 2011, 1996, 2332, 1521, 1055, 9619, 1012, 2169, 4942, 1011, 2708, 2018, 2000, 2562, 1999, 2204, 7192, 1996, 2346, 2013, 1996, 2212, 1011, 2708, 1521, 1055, 5039, 2000, 2010, 2219, 5039, 1025, 2947, 2009, 2001, 2825, 2000, 3362, 2035, 3033, 1997, 1996, 2406, 2007, 12596, 2553, 1012, 1996, 5485, 1010, 11427, 2000, 1996, 3930, 1999, 2068, 1997, 29575, 1998, 5568, 1010, 2411, 2719, 2312, 22722, 1010, 2823, 2195, 2661, 2898, 1010, 1998, 2009, 2150, 4072, 2000, 2191, 10425, 1997, 2992, 3011, 2083, 2068, 1010, 2007, 7346, 6908, 2058, 1996, 5025, 9199, 1012, 2065, 1996, 9199, 2020, 2205, 2898, 2005, 1996, 2111, 2000, 2958, 1010, 2027, 2018, 2000, 2191, 1037, 2146, 20010, 8162, 6229, 2027, 2071, 2424, 1037, 2173, 12949, 4867, 2000, 2958, 1012, 2823, 2053, 2107, 2173, 2071, 2022, 2179, 1010, 1998, 2059, 1996, 2069, 2518, 2589, 2001, 2000, 3338, 2091, 1996, 29575, 12402, 2058, 2037, 2219, 6147, 1010, 1998, 2061, 2433, 1037, 3653, 10010, 6313, 2958, 1012, 2000, 2892, 1037, 5460, 2588, 2023, 2785, 1997, 2958, 2001, 2025, 2467, 3647, 2005, 19284, 1025, 4703, 2111, 2439, 2037, 22849, 1010, 1998, 2020, 12805, 1012, 1999, 2035, 1996, 3469, 9199, 2045, 2020, 14731, 1997, 2300, 2104, 1996, 6147, 1997, 1996, 29575, 1025, 2061, 2008, 2065, 1037, 2711, 2081, 1037, 6270, 3357, 1010, 1998, 2253, 2091, 1010, 2002, 2001, 3236, 2011, 1996, 2783, 1010, 1998, 2001, 2471, 3056, 2000, 4558, 2010, 2166, 1010, 2138, 1996, 6147, 8729, 2032, 2013, 4803, 2000, 1996, 3302, 1012, 2107, 13436, 2020, 7108, 2000, 102]}, {"score": 0.7569103240966797, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "A Amulets.

Hence it behoved the living, and especially the relations upon whom the care and welfare of the ghosts depended, to be ever watchful for their interests; otherwise the ghosts would retaliate and cause illness and death in the clan. A favourite place of the ghosts was among the trees and plantains in the gardens, where they made sport, especially at noon when the sun shone brightly; on this account children were warned against going out to play in the gardens during the heat of the day, and even adults did not enter them at this time, unless they were obliged to do so. When the wind blew softly and murmured in the leaves of the trees, the ghosts were said to be talking to one another, and when a whirlwind occurred and carried up the dust and the leaves the ghosts were said to be at play. Ghosts hung about the graves in which their bodies lay buried; nothing would induce them to go far away from the spot except the removal of the body or of some particular portion of it. The special portion of the body to which a ghost clung was the lower jawbone (lwanga); when once this was taken away the ghost would follow it to the ends of the earth, and would be quite satisfied to remain with the jawbone if it were honoured. This supposed knowledge of the way to control a ghost has been acted upon for many years; there are jawbones of men, who lived nearly a thousand years ago, preserved to this day by members of the clan to which they belonged; and they are regarded as a most precious heirloom. The possession of the jawbone of a member of the clan would (it was thought) bring good fortune. Naturally the jawbones of kings were preserved with the utmost care, and were handed down from generation to generation, with numerous traditions.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 11277, 2020, 3373, 2000, 23120, 1999, 1996, 9884, 1997, 2037, 2214, 24542, 2015, 1025, 2027, 2020, 2245, 2000, 2031, 2037, 5165, 5286, 1010, 1998, 2036, 2000, 2514, 3056, 4122, 2172, 2004, 1996, 2542, 1025, 2027, 2018, 2037, 7777, 1998, 18959, 2015, 1010, 2027, 2020, 2333, 2011, 16056, 1998, 2081, 4854, 2011, 19046, 1012, 6516, 2009, 2022, 6806, 7178, 1996, 2542, 1010, 1998, 2926, 1996, 4262, 2588, 3183, 1996, 2729, 1998, 7574, 1997, 1996, 11277, 17292, 1010, 2000, 2022, 2412, 3422, 3993, 2005, 2037, 5426, 1025, 4728, 1996, 11277, 2052, 2128, 9080, 13143, 1998, 3426, 7355, 1998, 2331, 1999, 1996, 6338, 1012, 1037, 8837, 2173, 1997, 1996, 11277, 2001, 2426, 1996, 3628, 1998, 3269, 28247, 1999, 1996, 5822, 1010, 2073, 2027, 2081, 4368, 1010, 2926, 2012, 11501, 2043, 1996, 3103, 14707, 14224, 1025, 2006, 2023, 4070, 2336, 2020, 7420, 2114, 2183, 2041, 2000, 2377, 1999, 1996, 5822, 2076, 1996, 3684, 1997, 1996, 2154, 1010, 1998, 2130, 6001, 2106, 2025, 4607, 2068, 2012, 2023, 2051, 1010, 4983, 2027, 2020, 14723, 2000, 2079, 2061, 1012, 2043, 1996, 3612, 8682, 5238, 1998, 7152, 1999, 1996, 3727, 1997, 1996, 3628, 1010, 1996, 11277, 2020, 2056, 2000, 2022, 3331, 2000, 2028, 2178, 1010, 1998, 2043, 1037, 1059, 11961, 2140, 11101, 4158, 1998, 3344, 2039, 1996, 6497, 1998, 1996, 3727, 1996, 11277, 2020, 2056, 2000, 2022, 2012, 2377, 1012, 11277, 5112, 2055, 1996, 9729, 1999, 2029, 2037, 4230, 3913, 3950, 1025, 2498, 2052, 19653, 2068, 2000, 2175, 2521, 2185, 2013, 1996, 3962, 3272, 1996, 8208, 1997, 1996, 2303, 2030, 1997, 2070, 3327, 4664, 1997, 2009, 1012, 1996, 2569, 4664, 1997, 1996, 2303, 2000, 2029, 1037, 5745, 14752, 2001, 1996, 2896, 5730, 14417, 1006, 1048, 16600, 2050, 1007, 1025, 2043, 2320, 2023, 2001, 2579, 2185, 1996, 5745, 2052, 3582, 2009, 2000, 1996, 4515, 1997, 1996, 3011, 1010, 1998, 2052, 2022, 3243, 8510, 2000, 3961, 2007, 1996, 5730, 14417, 2065, 2009, 2020, 15546, 1012, 2023, 4011, 3716, 1997, 1996, 2126, 2000, 2491, 1037, 5745, 2038, 2042, 6051, 2588, 2005, 2116, 2086, 1025, 2045, 2024, 5730, 14417, 2015, 1997, 2273, 1010, 2040, 2973, 3053, 1037, 4595, 2086, 3283, 1010, 6560, 2000, 2023, 2154, 2011, 2372, 1997, 1996, 6338, 2000, 2029, 2027, 6272, 1025, 1998, 2027, 2024, 5240, 2004, 1037, 2087, 9062, 8215, 4135, 5358, 1012, 1996, 6664, 1997, 1996, 5730, 14417, 1997, 1037, 2266, 1997, 1996, 6338, 2052, 1006, 2009, 2001, 2245, 1007, 3288, 2204, 7280, 1012, 8100, 1996, 5730, 14417, 2015, 1997, 5465, 2020, 6560, 2007, 1996, 27917, 2729, 1010, 1998, 2020, 4375, 2091, 2013, 4245, 2000, 4245, 1010, 2007, 3365, 7443, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9649299383163452, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Each of these hills was sacred, and neither the King nor any messenger from him might venture upon them. On this account, whenever the King sent to rob or plunder people, they would escape to the nearest of these hills, and wait there until the King withdrew his party; both they and their goods would be safe as soon as they reached the sacred hill. At Gaga on the Boa hill there was a temple in charge of a priestess Kalambika, and also a female medium Bakima . No King was permitted to visit Boa, but all were compelled to stop short at the foot of the hill. It is related that King Mawanda wished to build his capital on the hill, but, after crossing the stream, he suddenly became blind, and remained so during his stay there, though, when he left the hill, he immediately recovered his sight. From that time onwards the hill has been regarded as sacred. On the hill there was a sacred forest, into which no one except the priest was permitted to enter. A broad path ran round the hill, and was kept in good repair by the chief of the district. If the chief allowed it to become overgrown with grass and weeds, and a grass fire caught any of the trees or the grass in the forest, the medium (it was said) would fall ill with burning sores. The chief would, under such circumstances, be fined for neglecting the road and allowing the fire to enter the forest. When a new chief was appointed to the district, he visited the grave of Matumpagwa (who is said to have been the first important chief in the district). On arriving at the grave, the chief spread a barkcloth over it, and mourned for the dead chief for several days; thereupon he killed a goat, and caused its blood to run into a drum, which was covered with the goat\u2019s skin and beaten. The chief gave to his principal wife two cows in token of his promotion to the chief\u2019s office; he also visited a number of places believed to be the abodes of ghosts, and propitiated them; at Muruli he offered a hoe to the ghost. At Mpumude he was given a woman to wife, and from there he returned to Boa, where he sat on a certain stone, while his wives were brought and introduced to him as though he did not know them. He was then given a pipe by the priestess Kalambika, which he smoked; afterwards he made a tour through the district, passing the grave of Matumpagwe .", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2169, 1997, 2122, 4564, 2001, 6730, 1010, 1998, 4445, 1996, 2332, 4496, 2151, 11981, 2013, 2032, 2453, 6957, 2588, 2068, 1012, 2006, 2023, 4070, 1010, 7188, 1996, 2332, 2741, 2000, 6487, 2030, 20228, 20824, 2111, 1010, 2027, 2052, 4019, 2000, 1996, 7205, 1997, 2122, 4564, 1010, 1998, 3524, 2045, 2127, 1996, 2332, 6780, 2010, 2283, 1025, 2119, 2027, 1998, 2037, 5350, 2052, 2022, 3647, 2004, 2574, 2004, 2027, 2584, 1996, 6730, 2940, 1012, 2012, 23332, 2006, 1996, 8945, 2050, 2940, 2045, 2001, 1037, 3379, 1999, 3715, 1997, 1037, 27677, 26209, 14905, 7556, 1010, 1998, 2036, 1037, 2931, 5396, 8670, 21138, 2050, 1012, 2053, 2332, 2001, 7936, 2000, 3942, 8945, 2050, 1010, 2021, 2035, 2020, 15055, 2000, 2644, 2460, 2012, 1996, 3329, 1997, 1996, 2940, 1012, 2009, 2003, 3141, 2008, 2332, 5003, 7447, 2850, 6257, 2000, 3857, 2010, 3007, 2006, 1996, 2940, 1010, 2021, 1010, 2044, 5153, 1996, 5460, 1010, 2002, 3402, 2150, 6397, 1010, 1998, 2815, 2061, 2076, 2010, 2994, 2045, 1010, 2295, 1010, 2043, 2002, 2187, 1996, 2940, 1010, 2002, 3202, 6757, 2010, 4356, 1012, 2013, 2008, 2051, 9921, 1996, 2940, 2038, 2042, 5240, 2004, 6730, 1012, 2006, 1996, 2940, 2045, 2001, 1037, 6730, 3224, 1010, 2046, 2029, 2053, 2028, 3272, 1996, 5011, 2001, 7936, 2000, 4607, 1012, 1037, 5041, 4130, 2743, 2461, 1996, 2940, 1010, 1998, 2001, 2921, 1999, 2204, 7192, 2011, 1996, 2708, 1997, 1996, 2212, 1012, 2065, 1996, 2708, 3039, 2009, 2000, 2468, 26433, 2007, 5568, 1998, 20777, 1010, 1998, 1037, 5568, 2543, 3236, 2151, 1997, 1996, 3628, 2030, 1996, 5568, 1999, 1996, 3224, 1010, 1996, 5396, 1006, 2009, 2001, 2056, 1007, 2052, 2991, 5665, 2007, 5255, 14699, 2015, 1012, 1996, 2708, 2052, 1010, 2104, 2107, 6214, 1010, 2022, 16981, 2005, 19046, 2075, 1996, 2346, 1998, 4352, 1996, 2543, 2000, 4607, 1996, 3224, 1012, 2043, 1037, 2047, 2708, 2001, 2805, 2000, 1996, 2212, 1010, 2002, 4716, 1996, 6542, 1997, 13523, 24237, 8490, 4213, 1006, 2040, 2003, 2056, 2000, 2031, 2042, 1996, 2034, 2590, 2708, 1999, 1996, 2212, 1007, 1012, 2006, 7194, 2012, 1996, 6542, 1010, 1996, 2708, 3659, 1037, 11286, 23095, 2058, 2009, 1010, 1998, 9587, 21737, 2094, 2005, 1996, 2757, 2708, 2005, 2195, 2420, 1025, 2045, 6279, 2239, 2002, 2730, 1037, 13555, 1010, 1998, 3303, 2049, 2668, 2000, 2448, 2046, 1037, 6943, 1010, 2029, 2001, 3139, 2007, 1996, 13555, 1521, 1055, 3096, 1998, 7854, 1012, 1996, 2708, 2435, 2000, 2010, 4054, 2564, 2048, 17188, 1999, 19204, 1997, 2010, 4712, 2000, 1996, 2708, 1521, 1055, 2436, 1025, 2002, 2036, 4716, 1037, 2193, 1997, 3182, 3373, 2000, 2022, 1996, 11113, 19847, 1997, 11277, 1010, 1998, 17678, 29050, 3064, 2068, 1025, 2012, 14163, 6820, 3669, 2002, 3253, 1037, 7570, 2063, 2000, 1996, 5745, 1012, 2012, 6131, 2819, 12672, 2002, 2001, 2445, 1037, 2450, 2000, 2564, 1010, 1998, 2013, 2045, 2002, 2513, 2000, 8945, 2050, 1010, 2073, 2002, 2938, 2006, 1037, 3056, 2962, 1010, 2096, 2010, 10403, 2020, 2716, 1998, 3107, 2000, 2032, 2004, 2295, 2002, 2106, 2025, 2113, 2068, 1012, 2002, 2001, 2059, 2445, 1037, 8667, 2011, 1996, 27677, 26209, 14905, 7556, 1010, 2029, 2002, 20482, 1025, 5728, 102]}, {"score": 0.9612142443656921, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "When a man\u2019s wife, or one of his children, was ill, he would sometimes take the fetich Nambaga outside his hut by night, and, holding it in one hand, would smoke upon it furiously, until the fetich possessed him, and gave him information as to the cause of the illness, and the treatment which he ought to adopt. Only the most skilled medicine-man could make fetiches; herbs had to be carefully selected, and other materials were needed, such as the hearts of lions, leopards, crocodiles, elephants, buffaloes, and other animals, which (it was supposed) would make the owner brave and strong. These materials were pounded together and stuffed into the horns, or they were mixed with clay, made into fetiches, and dedicated by the medicine-man to different gods.

This is a sudden illness, striking only small children, during which the body gets hot but the feet are cold (Note 10 Note \u2014 Bennett (1963, p. 155) states that this is a symptom of another related illness called kigalanga when it occurs in children. Some of my informants agreed that it could be brought by a ghost ( muzimu ) which is the agency bringing kigalanga, but the great majority thought it was a typical symptom of eyabwe . ). During this illness the child may shudder with feverish rigors, or even have convulsions. It is interesting in this context to note the fairly frequent reports by patients that their child had such an illness, but that it was only after convulsions had recurred in the absence of fever that they realised that it was suffering from epilepsy. It is probable that in some cases the fever has been associated with brain damage and the subsequent development of epilepsy, whilst in other cases it has precipitated epilepsy in a person already predisposed, and in whom epilepsy was very likely to appear anyway. The word eyabwe itself means \u2018theirs\u2019 (the children\u2019s) and refers to the fact that it is thought to be brought by \u201ctheir bird\u201d ( ennyonyi eyabwe ), which is an eagle. This is a reference to the suddenness of the onset of the illness, just as a bird of prey swoops down to catch its prey, and also to the fact that during a convulsion the eyes turn up as if to see the bird flying above them. If such a bird is seen the women with the children may shout up at it \u201c Omukulu, mukulu mukulu . . . .\u201d \u201cthe child is an old one, old enough to be fetching water\u201d, hoping to deceive the bird into thinking that the child is too old to be attacked. There are various other preventive measures, such as the tying of a small bell on to the left wrist, the noise of which will frighten the bird, or attract the mother\u2019s attention if the child moves to fend it off (Note 11 Note \u2014 Bennett (1963, p. 157) also noted this. Roscoe (1911, p. 101) says that nyonyi was a swelling in the side of an infant caused by the mother eating forbidden food during pregnancy. He almost certainly confused the name with that of another illness. Aall-Jilek (1965) says that the Wapogoro believe certain birds should not be killed, especially the fish eagle, because it circles and then drops to the earth like an epileptic in an attack. ). Eyabwe can also refer to \u201ctheir insect\u201d which lives in the ground ( eyabwe eya wansi ), usually a spider ( nnabubi ). Cases of eyabwe caused by this insect turn their eyes down instead of up during a convulsion (a rare enough occurrence to make this a rather unusual form of the illness).", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1041, 3148, 2497, 8545, 1012, 2023, 2003, 1037, 5573, 7355, 1010, 8478, 2069, 2235, 2336, 1010, 2076, 2029, 1996, 2303, 4152, 2980, 2021, 1996, 2519, 2024, 3147, 1006, 3602, 2184, 3602, 1517, 8076, 1006, 3699, 1010, 1052, 1012, 14168, 1007, 2163, 2008, 2023, 2003, 1037, 25353, 27718, 5358, 1997, 2178, 3141, 7355, 2170, 11382, 9692, 18222, 2043, 2009, 5158, 1999, 2336, 1012, 2070, 1997, 2026, 28694, 2015, 3530, 2008, 2009, 2071, 2022, 2716, 2011, 1037, 5745, 1006, 14163, 5831, 12274, 1007, 2029, 2003, 1996, 4034, 5026, 11382, 9692, 18222, 1010, 2021, 1996, 2307, 3484, 2245, 2009, 2001, 1037, 5171, 25353, 27718, 5358, 1997, 1041, 3148, 2497, 8545, 1012, 1007, 1012, 2076, 2023, 7355, 1996, 2775, 2089, 18261, 2007, 9016, 4509, 19838, 5668, 1010, 2030, 2130, 2031, 9530, 19722, 4877, 8496, 1012, 2009, 2003, 5875, 1999, 2023, 6123, 2000, 3602, 1996, 7199, 6976, 4311, 2011, 5022, 2008, 2037, 2775, 2018, 2107, 2019, 7355, 1010, 2021, 2008, 2009, 2001, 2069, 2044, 9530, 19722, 4877, 8496, 2018, 28667, 3126, 5596, 1999, 1996, 6438, 1997, 9016, 2008, 2027, 11323, 2008, 2009, 2001, 6114, 2013, 4958, 9463, 18075, 1012, 2009, 2003, 15596, 2008, 1999, 2070, 3572, 1996, 9016, 2038, 2042, 3378, 2007, 4167, 4053, 1998, 1996, 4745, 2458, 1997, 4958, 9463, 18075, 1010, 5819, 1999, 2060, 3572, 2009, 2038, 3653, 6895, 23270, 4383, 4958, 9463, 18075, 1999, 1037, 2711, 2525, 3653, 10521, 19155, 1010, 1998, 1999, 3183, 4958, 9463, 18075, 2001, 2200, 3497, 2000, 3711, 4312, 1012, 1996, 2773, 1041, 3148, 2497, 8545, 2993, 2965, 1520, 17156, 1521, 1006, 1996, 2336, 1521, 1055, 1007, 1998, 5218, 2000, 1996, 2755, 2008, 2009, 2003, 2245, 2000, 2022, 2716, 2011, 1523, 2037, 4743, 1524, 1006, 4372, 4890, 16585, 2072, 1041, 3148, 2497, 8545, 1007, 1010, 2029, 2003, 2019, 6755, 1012, 2023, 2003, 1037, 4431, 2000, 1996, 5573, 2791, 1997, 1996, 14447, 1997, 1996, 7355, 1010, 2074, 2004, 1037, 4743, 1997, 8336, 25430, 18589, 2015, 2091, 2000, 4608, 2049, 8336, 1010, 1998, 2036, 2000, 1996, 2755, 2008, 2076, 1037, 9530, 19722, 4877, 3258, 1996, 2159, 2735, 2039, 2004, 2065, 2000, 2156, 1996, 4743, 3909, 2682, 2068, 1012, 2065, 2107, 1037, 4743, 2003, 2464, 1996, 2308, 2007, 1996, 2336, 2089, 11245, 2039, 2012, 2009, 1523, 18168, 6968, 20391, 1010, 14163, 5283, 7630, 14163, 5283, 7630, 1012, 1012, 1012, 1012, 1524, 1523, 1996, 2775, 2003, 2019, 2214, 2028, 1010, 2214, 2438, 2000, 2022, 18584, 2075, 2300, 1524, 1010, 5327, 2000, 11703, 7416, 3726, 1996, 4743, 2046, 3241, 2008, 1996, 2775, 2003, 2205, 2214, 2000, 2022, 4457, 1012, 2045, 2024, 2536, 2060, 4652, 3512, 5761, 1010, 2107, 2004, 1996, 15233, 1997, 1037, 2235, 4330, 2006, 2000, 1996, 2187, 7223, 1010, 1996, 5005, 1997, 2029, 2097, 25966, 2368, 1996, 4743, 1010, 2030, 9958, 1996, 2388, 1521, 1055, 3086, 2065, 1996, 2775, 5829, 2000, 21713, 2094, 2009, 2125, 1006, 3602, 2340, 3602, 1517, 8076, 1006, 3699, 1010, 1052, 1012, 17403, 1007, 2036, 3264, 2023, 1012, 20996, 28147, 1006, 5184, 1010, 1052, 1012, 7886, 1007, 2758, 2008, 6396, 16585, 2072, 2001, 1037, 18348, 1999, 1996, 2217, 1997, 2019, 10527, 3303, 2011, 1996, 2388, 5983, 10386, 102]}, {"score": 0.9393066763877869, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Akasumagizi .

The Baganda imply certain things when they refer to illnesses as Kiganda. They think of them as \u2018strong\u2019 illnesses and they are usually sent by another, although there are many exceptions. There are traditional forms of therapy for them although in these days the traditional art of healing is thought to have been largely lost. Western medicine is not considered to be particularly effective in treating such illnesses. The underlying feeling is that Europeans know how to treat their own diseases (non-Kiganda ones, sometimes called ez\u2019ekizungu, \u201cthose of the Europeans\u201d). Those illnesses which are untreatable by western medicine or are difficult to treat, as in the case with mental illness, are thought therefore to be Kiganda diseases, and are of course strong since traditional forms of therapy are not often very useful either. The fact that the Government provides free medical treatment means that often people attend Government clinics in the first instance before trying traditional methods of healing. Since most people get better from mild illnesses despite medicine or with very simple treatment, this ensures the perpetuation of the image of Western medicine being effective for \u2018weak\u2019 illnesses. Europeans are renowned for insisting that illnesses are not brought by witchcraft, but because of the tendency to polarise these notions this means that Kiganda illnesses are those that are so brought. There are other reasons for strong Kiganda illnesses being thought to be brought by witchcraft. Madness, epilepsy and the other strong illnesses bring an enormous amount of trouble to a patient and his family and usually tend to follow a chronic course extending over many years, if not a lifetime. In order to cope with such a stressful situation, an explanatory model (paranoid in nature) is formulated by the family, which apart from helping them to talk about the illness, also absolves them from blame and opens up a course of action. No one bothers to use such a model when referring to a cold, but the \u2018strong\u2019 diseases are almost always said to be sent. It does mean, however, that if someone within a family suffers from a strong illness considerable suspicions arise and back-biting can occur.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2023, 3732, 5579, 2965, 2367, 2477, 2000, 2367, 2111, 2021, 1999, 2236, 1996, 11382, 5289, 2850, 24757, 2024, 2216, 2008, 1996, 4524, 13832, 2903, 2000, 2031, 2042, 2525, 21358, 29301, 2075, 2068, 2077, 1996, 14560, 1998, 13481, 2234, 2000, 2037, 2406, 1012, 1996, 4524, 13832, 19515, 3056, 2477, 2043, 2027, 6523, 2000, 24757, 2004, 11382, 5289, 2850, 1012, 2027, 2228, 1997, 2068, 2004, 1520, 2844, 1521, 24757, 1998, 2027, 2024, 2788, 2741, 2011, 2178, 1010, 2348, 2045, 2024, 2116, 11790, 1012, 2045, 2024, 3151, 3596, 1997, 7242, 2005, 2068, 2348, 1999, 2122, 2420, 1996, 3151, 2396, 1997, 8907, 2003, 2245, 2000, 2031, 2042, 4321, 2439, 1012, 2530, 4200, 2003, 2025, 2641, 2000, 2022, 3391, 4621, 1999, 12318, 2107, 24757, 1012, 1996, 10318, 3110, 2003, 2008, 13481, 2113, 2129, 2000, 7438, 2037, 2219, 7870, 1006, 2512, 1011, 11382, 5289, 2850, 3924, 1010, 2823, 2170, 1041, 2480, 1521, 23174, 9759, 3070, 2226, 1010, 1523, 2216, 1997, 1996, 13481, 1524, 1007, 1012, 2216, 24757, 2029, 2024, 4895, 7913, 27892, 2011, 2530, 4200, 2030, 2024, 3697, 2000, 7438, 1010, 2004, 1999, 1996, 2553, 2007, 5177, 7355, 1010, 2024, 2245, 3568, 2000, 2022, 11382, 5289, 2850, 7870, 1010, 1998, 2024, 1997, 2607, 2844, 2144, 3151, 3596, 1997, 7242, 2024, 2025, 2411, 2200, 6179, 2593, 1012, 1996, 2755, 2008, 1996, 2231, 3640, 2489, 2966, 3949, 2965, 2008, 2411, 2111, 5463, 2231, 17865, 1999, 1996, 2034, 6013, 2077, 2667, 3151, 4725, 1997, 8907, 1012, 2144, 2087, 2111, 2131, 2488, 2013, 10256, 24757, 2750, 4200, 2030, 2007, 2200, 3722, 3949, 1010, 2023, 21312, 1996, 2566, 22327, 14505, 1997, 1996, 3746, 1997, 2530, 4200, 2108, 4621, 2005, 1520, 5410, 1521, 24757, 1012, 13481, 2024, 8228, 2005, 22604, 2008, 24757, 2024, 2025, 2716, 2011, 21599, 1010, 2021, 2138, 1997, 1996, 11765, 2000, 11508, 5562, 2122, 21951, 2023, 2965, 2008, 11382, 5289, 2850, 24757, 2024, 2216, 2008, 2024, 2061, 2716, 1012, 2045, 2024, 2060, 4436, 2005, 2844, 11382, 5289, 2850, 24757, 2108, 2245, 2000, 2022, 2716, 2011, 21599, 1012, 12013, 1010, 4958, 9463, 18075, 1998, 1996, 2060, 2844, 24757, 3288, 2019, 8216, 3815, 1997, 4390, 2000, 1037, 5776, 1998, 2010, 2155, 1998, 2788, 7166, 2000, 3582, 1037, 11888, 2607, 8402, 2058, 2116, 2086, 1010, 2065, 2025, 1037, 6480, 1012, 1999, 2344, 2000, 11997, 2007, 2107, 1037, 6911, 3993, 3663, 1010, 2019, 4654, 24759, 5162, 7062, 2944, 1006, 19810, 1999, 3267, 1007, 2003, 19788, 2011, 1996, 2155, 1010, 2029, 4237, 2013, 5094, 2068, 2000, 2831, 2055, 1996, 7355, 1010, 2036, 14689, 4747, 6961, 2068, 2013, 7499, 1998, 7480, 2039, 1037, 2607, 1997, 2895, 1012, 2053, 2028, 8572, 2015, 2000, 2224, 2107, 1037, 2944, 2043, 7727, 2000, 1037, 3147, 1010, 2021, 1996, 1520, 2844, 1521, 7870, 2024, 2471, 2467, 2056, 2000, 2022, 2741, 1012, 2009, 2515, 2812, 1010, 2174, 1010, 2008, 2065, 2619, 2306, 1037, 2155, 17567, 2013, 1037, 2844, 7355, 6196, 17817, 13368, 1998, 2067, 1011, 12344, 2064, 5258, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.6624370813369751, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "\u2018Strong\u2019 illnesses are sometimes called olumbe (death) and some older people say that all illnesses can be called this, since anyone may die from any illness.

If an injection is obtained it may be of some inferior type which does not work thus indicating that European medicine may not in fact be very effective.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 10262, 2008, 14955, 3695, 2003, 4337, 2098, 2004, 5147, 2004, 2009, 2038, 2042, 1999, 2885, 1998, 2637, 2009, 2064, 2022, 5071, 2008, 2023, 7355, 2097, 3413, 1996, 2126, 1997, 25765, 2029, 2003, 14599, 2464, 2069, 6524, 1999, 10031, 1012, 9016, 1998, 2691, 3147, 2024, 2641, 2000, 2031, 17215, 3431, 1999, 3522, 2335, 1010, 2025, 2069, 1999, 3267, 2021, 2036, 1999, 2171, 1010, 1996, 8290, 2090, 2171, 1998, 3267, 2108, 3375, 1010, 2025, 3722, 3426, 1998, 3466, 1012, 2061, 2009, 2003, 2005, 2070, 3114, 2245, 2008, 9016, 1006, 18168, 12083, 15735, 1010, 1996, 11320, 5289, 2850, 2005, 1996, 2303, 1007, 2038, 2468, 1037, 1520, 2844, 1521, 7355, 1006, 18168, 2271, 23049, 3900, 1007, 2029, 2089, 3102, 2111, 1010, 1998, 6660, 1996, 2691, 3147, 1006, 7020, 2368, 4890, 13340, 1007, 2003, 3352, 11320, 3762, 10631, 2527, 2029, 2003, 2763, 2190, 5421, 2004, 24442, 1012, 1996, 2755, 2008, 24479, 2024, 2085, 4621, 2114, 2175, 12131, 25032, 8913, 2050, 1998, 25353, 21850, 6856, 2003, 3383, 2019, 10318, 3114, 2005, 19195, 1999, 2062, 5161, 7925, 2008, 2027, 2020, 2716, 2011, 1996, 14560, 1998, 13481, 1010, 2348, 1996, 3484, 1997, 11904, 2228, 1997, 2068, 2004, 3151, 11382, 5289, 2850, 24757, 1012, 1996, 2352, 2099, 1521, 1055, 7729, 2089, 8339, 1996, 2755, 2008, 2000, 6855, 2019, 13341, 1997, 7279, 28775, 21202, 2788, 5366, 2055, 2184, 1013, 1011, 2029, 8509, 2009, 3458, 2037, 3733, 3362, 1998, 2045, 2003, 2947, 1037, 8536, 1999, 2893, 3949, 1012, 2065, 2019, 13341, 2003, 4663, 2009, 2089, 2022, 1997, 2070, 14092, 2828, 2029, 2515, 2025, 2147, 2947, 8131, 2008, 2647, 4200, 2089, 2025, 1999, 2755, 2022, 2200, 4621, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9686746597290039, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Illnesses that are sent may be caused in several ways and in fact, although eddogo means witchcraft, when further inquiry is made it is seen that those illnesses that are sent include those that are considered to be brought by spirits acting on their own initiative, as well as those forces manipulated by other people. There are several works available which include chapters on the traditional beliefs of the Baganda and so it is only necessary to summarise these and in places to clarify the picture. The Baganda believe in several forms of spirits; balubaale (hero-gods), mayembe (literally meaning horns, but referring to spirits residing in horns or other receptacles), mizimu (the ghosts of dead ancestors), misambwa (spirits associated with certain animals, rivers, rocks or forests) and kitambo (a spirit usually causing people to walk naked at night and eat dead bodies). Difficulties arise when discussing the cause of illnesses with patients and their families as Bennett et al. (1964) discovered when asking about childhood diarrhoea. Although relatives admitted that a possible cause was obusobe, a ritual mistake made in pregnancy or infancy ( obusobya, a mistake) none admitted that this was the reason for their own child\u2019s diarrhoea. The Baganda do, in fact, have a proverb \u2018Lubaale agoba nsonga\u2019 nga takutidde wuwo . (A Lubaale punishes with reason, provided that it has not killed one of your own relatives). Although there are said to be some diseases which result from the breaking of certain taboos, it does not seem to be an important reason in these days. Amakiro is thought to be brought by committing adultery during pregnancy and a rash may be caused in infants because the mother ate salt during the pregnancy (Note 15 Note \u2014 Southwold (1959, p. 45) also found this. He says that although one reads of such illnesses in the literature, \u201cI never heard of a specific case of anyone with the disease, and when I approached it from the other end, by asking what would happen if anyone did break the taboo, people were pretty sceptical whether anything would.\u201d He says also (p. 46) \u201cPeople will tell you that buko is an illness that people get through committing incest, but when you ask what happens to a man who commits incest and is not prosecuted they will say \u201cnothing.\u201d.\u201d ).", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 24757, 2008, 2024, 2741, 2089, 2022, 3303, 1999, 2195, 3971, 1998, 1999, 2755, 1010, 2348, 3968, 16168, 2080, 2965, 21599, 1010, 2043, 2582, 9934, 2003, 2081, 2009, 2003, 2464, 2008, 2216, 24757, 2008, 2024, 2741, 2421, 2216, 2008, 2024, 2641, 2000, 2022, 2716, 2011, 8633, 3772, 2006, 2037, 2219, 6349, 1010, 2004, 2092, 2004, 2216, 2749, 20063, 2011, 2060, 2111, 1012, 2045, 2024, 2195, 2573, 2800, 2029, 2421, 9159, 2006, 1996, 3151, 9029, 1997, 1996, 4524, 13832, 1998, 2061, 2009, 2003, 2069, 4072, 2000, 7680, 7849, 5562, 2122, 1998, 1999, 3182, 2000, 25037, 1996, 3861, 1012, 1996, 4524, 13832, 2903, 1999, 2195, 3596, 1997, 8633, 1025, 28352, 19761, 9453, 1006, 5394, 1011, 5932, 1007, 1010, 2089, 6633, 4783, 1006, 6719, 3574, 11569, 1010, 2021, 7727, 2000, 8633, 7154, 1999, 11569, 2030, 2060, 28667, 23606, 18630, 2015, 1007, 1010, 2771, 5831, 12274, 1006, 1996, 11277, 1997, 2757, 10748, 1007, 1010, 28616, 3286, 2497, 4213, 1006, 8633, 3378, 2007, 3056, 4176, 1010, 5485, 1010, 5749, 2030, 6138, 1007, 1998, 8934, 3286, 5092, 1006, 1037, 4382, 2788, 4786, 2111, 2000, 3328, 6248, 2012, 2305, 1998, 4521, 2757, 4230, 1007, 1012, 8190, 13368, 2043, 10537, 1996, 3426, 1997, 24757, 2007, 5022, 1998, 2037, 2945, 2004, 8076, 3802, 2632, 1012, 1006, 3546, 1007, 3603, 2043, 4851, 2055, 5593, 22939, 12171, 14490, 2050, 1012, 2348, 9064, 4914, 2008, 1037, 2825, 3426, 2001, 27885, 26658, 4783, 1010, 1037, 8887, 6707, 2081, 1999, 10032, 2030, 22813, 1006, 27885, 26658, 3762, 2050, 1010, 1037, 6707, 1007, 3904, 4914, 2008, 2023, 2001, 1996, 3114, 2005, 2037, 2219, 2775, 1521, 1055, 22939, 12171, 14490, 2050, 1012, 1996, 4524, 13832, 2079, 1010, 1999, 2755, 1010, 2031, 1037, 6011, 15185, 1520, 11320, 3676, 9453, 3283, 3676, 24978, 26356, 1521, 12835, 2050, 27006, 21823, 14141, 2063, 8814, 12155, 1012, 1006, 1037, 11320, 3676, 9453, 16385, 2229, 2007, 3114, 1010, 3024, 2008, 2009, 2038, 2025, 2730, 2028, 1997, 2115, 2219, 9064, 1007, 1012, 2348, 2045, 2024, 2056, 2000, 2022, 2070, 7870, 2029, 2765, 2013, 1996, 4911, 1997, 3056, 27505, 2015, 1010, 2009, 2515, 2025, 4025, 2000, 2022, 2019, 2590, 3114, 1999, 2122, 2420, 1012, 25933, 23630, 2080, 2003, 2245, 2000, 2022, 2716, 2011, 16873, 29169, 2076, 10032, 1998, 1037, 23438, 2089, 2022, 3303, 1999, 16725, 2138, 1996, 2388, 8823, 5474, 2076, 1996, 10032, 1006, 3602, 2321, 3602, 1517, 2148, 12155, 6392, 1006, 3851, 1010, 1052, 1012, 3429, 1007, 2036, 2179, 2023, 1012, 2002, 2758, 2008, 2348, 2028, 9631, 1997, 2107, 24757, 1999, 1996, 3906, 1010, 1523, 1045, 2196, 2657, 1997, 1037, 3563, 2553, 1997, 3087, 2007, 1996, 4295, 1010, 1998, 2043, 1045, 5411, 2009, 2013, 1996, 2060, 2203, 1010, 2011, 4851, 2054, 2052, 4148, 2065, 3087, 2106, 3338, 1996, 27505, 1010, 2111, 2020, 3492, 8040, 23606, 7476, 3251, 2505, 2052, 1012, 1524, 2002, 2758, 2036, 1006, 1052, 1012, 4805, 1007, 1523, 2111, 2097, 2425, 2017, 2008, 20934, 3683, 2003, 2019, 7355, 2008, 2111, 2131, 2083, 16873, 4297, 4355, 1010, 2021, 2043, 2017, 3198, 2054, 6433, 2000, 1037, 2158, 2040, 27791, 4297, 4355, 1998, 2003, 2025, 21651, 2027, 2097, 2360, 1523, 2498, 1012, 1524, 1012, 1524, 102]}, {"score": 0.9609270691871643, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Illness may be brought by any of the above spirits except the kitambo, and also by substances ( eddogo ) prepared by witches and placed in such a way that the victim passes near it.

They are intimately concerned in the affairs of this world and are not content with an other-worldly existence, but unfortunately can only share in this world through the use of mediums, whom they possess. This is seen as a weakness on their part. To be possessed by a lubaale is called okusamira, but this is an active verb denoting that the medium is doing something to or for the lubaale and it is best translated as \u201cserving the lubaale \u201d (Note 21 Note \u2014 Nsimbi (1956, p. 120) states that one of the names for mediums is abakongozzi . This is the name of a servant who carries his master or mistress on his shoulders, particularly one of the Kabakas, Princes and Princesses. It therefore conveys the notion of the medium being a servant of the lubaale . Verbs ending in -ira as in okusamira tend to be used for doing something for someone. ). Certain people in the community are known to serve the balubaale at times. The balubaale usually make known their desire to possess someone by making that person ill, but not ill enough to kill him. They may also bring continued misfortune to a family. This forces the family to attend the doctor to find the cause of the illness or misfortune. The serving of balubaale runs in families and theoretically it can be excluded as a cause of illness in those families which have never had members serving in the past, although it is relatively rare to find such a family. It is generally considered that most family units ( enda ), consisting of brothers with the same father, their wives and all their offspring, (probably about 15 adults) will contain someone who serves the balubaale .", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1999, 2122, 2420, 2012, 2560, 1010, 1996, 28352, 19761, 9453, 4025, 2000, 2022, 1996, 2087, 2590, 1997, 1996, 8633, 1012, 2027, 2024, 29024, 4986, 1999, 1996, 3821, 1997, 2023, 2088, 1998, 2024, 2025, 4180, 2007, 2019, 2060, 1011, 2088, 2135, 4598, 1010, 2021, 6854, 2064, 2069, 3745, 1999, 2023, 2088, 2083, 1996, 2224, 1997, 5396, 2015, 1010, 3183, 2027, 10295, 1012, 2023, 2003, 2464, 2004, 1037, 11251, 2006, 2037, 2112, 1012, 2000, 2022, 8679, 2011, 1037, 11320, 3676, 9453, 2003, 2170, 7929, 10383, 14503, 2050, 1010, 2021, 2023, 2003, 2019, 3161, 12034, 7939, 20656, 2008, 1996, 5396, 2003, 2725, 2242, 2000, 2030, 2005, 1996, 11320, 3676, 9453, 1998, 2009, 2003, 2190, 5421, 2004, 1523, 3529, 1996, 11320, 3676, 9453, 1524, 1006, 3602, 2538, 3602, 1517, 24978, 5714, 5638, 1006, 3838, 1010, 1052, 1012, 6036, 1007, 2163, 2008, 2028, 1997, 1996, 3415, 2005, 5396, 2015, 2003, 19557, 25460, 18153, 5831, 1012, 2023, 2003, 1996, 2171, 1997, 1037, 7947, 2040, 7883, 2010, 3040, 2030, 10414, 2006, 2010, 4065, 1010, 3391, 2028, 1997, 1996, 10556, 3676, 13716, 1010, 12000, 1998, 4615, 2229, 1012, 2009, 3568, 16636, 2015, 1996, 9366, 1997, 1996, 5396, 2108, 1037, 7947, 1997, 1996, 11320, 3676, 9453, 1012, 16025, 4566, 1999, 1011, 11209, 2004, 1999, 7929, 10383, 14503, 2050, 7166, 2000, 2022, 2109, 2005, 2725, 2242, 2005, 2619, 1012, 1007, 1012, 3056, 2111, 1999, 1996, 2451, 2024, 2124, 2000, 3710, 1996, 28352, 19761, 9453, 2012, 2335, 1012, 1996, 28352, 19761, 9453, 2788, 2191, 2124, 2037, 4792, 2000, 10295, 2619, 2011, 2437, 2008, 2711, 5665, 1010, 2021, 2025, 5665, 2438, 2000, 3102, 2032, 1012, 2027, 2089, 2036, 3288, 2506, 28616, 13028, 9816, 2000, 1037, 2155, 1012, 2023, 2749, 1996, 2155, 2000, 5463, 1996, 3460, 2000, 2424, 1996, 3426, 1997, 1996, 7355, 2030, 28616, 13028, 9816, 1012, 1996, 3529, 1997, 28352, 19761, 9453, 3216, 1999, 2945, 1998, 22634, 2009, 2064, 2022, 12421, 2004, 1037, 3426, 1997, 7355, 1999, 2216, 2945, 2029, 2031, 2196, 2018, 2372, 3529, 1999, 1996, 2627, 1010, 2348, 2009, 2003, 4659, 4678, 2000, 2424, 2107, 1037, 2155, 1012, 2009, 2003, 3227, 2641, 2008, 2087, 2155, 3197, 1006, 2203, 2050, 1007, 1010, 5398, 1997, 3428, 2007, 1996, 2168, 2269, 1010, 2037, 10403, 1998, 2035, 2037, 13195, 1010, 1006, 2763, 2055, 2321, 6001, 1007, 2097, 5383, 2619, 2040, 4240, 1996, 28352, 19761, 9453, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9662309288978577, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "The traditional doctor will already be serving the balubaale and while in a trance he will tell the patient what has brought his illness and what steps need to be taken to cure it.

For example Kawumpuli is associated with plague and Wanema with lameness ( obulema ).

The muzimu may also produce a sudden illness, especially if sent by someone. I saw a boy of about 20 some five days after such an illness had started. He had fallen ill with fever, became comatose and in fact died a few hours later. A muzimu of someone who had a chronic illness or who had killed himself, may visit others in the family bringing the condition upon them (Note 25 Note \u2014 Roscoe (1911, p. 100) states that \u201cPthisis\u201d (presumably Roscoe means akafuba ) \u201cwas always said to be caused by the ghost of some ancestor who had died of the complaint, and unless the ghost could be propitiated, it would kill the patient\u201d. Ghosts ( mizimu ) tend to be limited to their own family relations who are closer than the clan as a whole. ). For this reason the bodies of such people are buried far away from the house because a muzimu is thought not to wander far from its body. Bennett (1963, p. 155) says that \u201c kifalu (meaning a jeep or Land Rover that is powerful and emitting a lot of noise) is the descriptive term given to a variety of violent noisy states such as delirium in typhoid or the restlessness of meningitis. Many hysterical states and epilepsy fall into this pattern, and the term is used to cover the violence and agony of the caning of a pupil by a teacher!\u201d The word kifalu is the Swahili for rhinoceros, and is used by extension in the above ways (Note 26 Note \u2014 One of the Nyoro mbandwa spirits is called Kifaru, referring in particular to the extended meaning of a military tank. Beattie (1967, p. 30) \u201c. . . Kifaru is not the ghost or manifestation of any particular tank, but rather the essence of all tanks, \u2018tankness\u2019, with all the formidability and power that this implies\u201d.

The mourners became apprehensive and some minutes later a boy became dizzy, and he vomited and defaecated into his trousers. The mourners all began to run away from the house and another girl was affected. A boy of 17 tried carrying away the girl who was first affected, from the house. He himself was overcome by dizziness and weakness. A traditional doctor was called who specialised in dealing with mayembe and for a fee of 250/- said that a hen and a goat needed sacrificing. He told the family that it was just as well that he had been called because had he not brought medicine, three people would have died in the night. The body of the man who had died was hastily buried that day instead of waiting until the next. Meanwhile at a homestead a few miles away some children who had been at the house of the deceased in the morning began to be attacked. The first got a fever at about the same time as the others had been attacked and it was after this that word came that mayembe had attacked the other household.

I was called to see an elderly woman who had had severe stomach ache. She was surrounded by women neighbours who had covered her head with a cloth and were giving her inhalations of burning peppers in order to make things so unpleasant for the spirit that it would reveal itself. At the time of my arrival she was extremely agitated and was making a series of incoherent barking noises and did indeed seem possessed in some way. From lack of time and out of consideration for her son who had taken me there I was obliged to interrupt the proceedings. Palpation of her stomach revealed that there was no gross illness. I therefore reassured her and those around that she was recovering and gave her the only medicine I had with me at the time, a tranquillizer tablet (chlorpromazine 100 mgm). She apparently made a quick and uneventful recovery with no recurrence. The interruption, however, had made some of the women neighbours angry because it had prevented the act being played out to the full. The true diagnosis therefore could not be made, since it was assumed that the spirit had been about to reveal itself. It is quite likely that her barking would have become coherent enough for some, possibly cryptic, information to have been gathered from it. This kind of an attack by a muzimu is known as kigalanga . Mair (Note 27 Note \u2014 Mair (1934, p. 226). An account of the capturing of mizimu by causing the patient to vomit them into a gourd is given by Kagwa (1934, p. 126). Ssekamwa (1967, p. 37) also describes a case of the capture of mayembe . The involuntary shivering which comes with fever may be interpreted as empewo which means a cold wind and so by extension a ghost. Dr. J. Bennett tells me that the word is also used occasionally for cases of kwashiorkor in infants. The Baganda recognise that this comes following the weaning of the child. The body swells and because of this the skin feels cold so that it is thought that the illness is due to the child getting cold at night now that it is separated from the mother. The word empewo in this context merely means that the child gets cold and does not refer to the extended meaning of a ghost. The illness is properly known as obwosi and also as omusana, the sun, because the stretched pale skin shines like the sun. ) says that \u201cthe spirit is supposed to enter the stomach by the mouth and cause a kind of indigestion known as kigalanga, whose first symptom is said to be a very cold feeling.

Similarly, during an epileptic fit it seems as if the patient has become possessed by some outside force and is no longer able to control his actions. It would therefore seem quite reasonable to think of both conditions as being caused by spirits which take control of the patient\u2019s body, causing him to behave in a strange way. If people are asked what brought a strong illness the immediate answer is usually \u201cthey bewitched him\u201d, but this may well be modified if a further explanation is asked for. As has been noted, there are two principal types of spirits. The first include the balubaale and the family mayembe . These are very human in nature and their object is to encourage people to work for them in different ways. They would therefore never kill or produce a bad chronic illness unless the patient and his family had ignored their requests. This could be because of religious scruples or other beliefs opposed to the idea of appeasing spirits or simply because of laziness or lack of money. The second principal type of spirits include the muzimu and the mayembe ag\u2019ekifalu . These come to kill and are likely to produce a rather violent or unpleasant illness. At first sight therefore, an epileptic fit would appear to be brought by these latter since it is a rather violent and horrifying episode. There is something rather inhuman about a fit and this accords with the idea that it is produced by mayembe ag\u2019ekifalu, who cannot be conversed with like the balubaale . Those possessed by a lubaale or who have an illness caused by one, remain like human beings. On one occasion I was told that a madman, who was confused but not violent, was probably affected by a lubaale because it was \u2018treating him nicely\u2019. In the case of epilepsy, however, it is recognised that no spirit would be so inept as to fail to kill the patient every time it came. When talking in general terms it may be said that epilepsy is brought by mayembe, but when actually confronted by a case in the family, relatives are much more uncertain about the cause.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2043, 2111, 2468, 5506, 2027, 16582, 1999, 1037, 2126, 3243, 2041, 1997, 4363, 2007, 2037, 5156, 6180, 1010, 2004, 2065, 2027, 2018, 2468, 2178, 2711, 1012, 6660, 1010, 2076, 2019, 4958, 9463, 20746, 4906, 2009, 3849, 2004, 2065, 1996, 5776, 2038, 2468, 8679, 2011, 2070, 2648, 2486, 1998, 2003, 2053, 2936, 2583, 2000, 2491, 2010, 4506, 1012, 2009, 2052, 3568, 4025, 3243, 9608, 2000, 2228, 1997, 2119, 3785, 2004, 2108, 3303, 2011, 8633, 2029, 2202, 2491, 1997, 1996, 5776, 1521, 1055, 2303, 1010, 4786, 2032, 2000, 16582, 1999, 1037, 4326, 2126, 1012, 2065, 2111, 2024, 2356, 2054, 2716, 1037, 2844, 7355, 1996, 6234, 3437, 2003, 2788, 1523, 2027, 2022, 9148, 28265, 2032, 1524, 1010, 2021, 2023, 2089, 2092, 2022, 6310, 2065, 1037, 2582, 7526, 2003, 2356, 2005, 1012, 2004, 2038, 2042, 3264, 1010, 2045, 2024, 2048, 4054, 4127, 1997, 8633, 1012, 1996, 2034, 2421, 1996, 28352, 19761, 9453, 1998, 1996, 2155, 2089, 6633, 4783, 1012, 2122, 2024, 2200, 2529, 1999, 3267, 1998, 2037, 4874, 2003, 2000, 8627, 2111, 2000, 2147, 2005, 2068, 1999, 2367, 3971, 1012, 2027, 2052, 3568, 2196, 3102, 2030, 3965, 1037, 2919, 11888, 7355, 4983, 1996, 5776, 1998, 2010, 2155, 2018, 6439, 2037, 11186, 1012, 2023, 2071, 2022, 2138, 1997, 3412, 8040, 21531, 4244, 2030, 2060, 9029, 4941, 2000, 1996, 2801, 1997, 10439, 5243, 7741, 8633, 2030, 3432, 2138, 1997, 2474, 21254, 4757, 2030, 3768, 1997, 2769, 1012, 1996, 2117, 4054, 2828, 1997, 8633, 2421, 1996, 14163, 5831, 12274, 1998, 1996, 2089, 6633, 4783, 12943, 1521, 23174, 7011, 7630, 1012, 2122, 2272, 2000, 3102, 1998, 2024, 3497, 2000, 3965, 1037, 2738, 6355, 2030, 16010, 7355, 1012, 2012, 2034, 4356, 3568, 1010, 2019, 4958, 9463, 20746, 4906, 2052, 3711, 2000, 2022, 2716, 2011, 2122, 3732, 2144, 2009, 2003, 1037, 2738, 6355, 1998, 7570, 18752, 14116, 2792, 1012, 2045, 2003, 2242, 2738, 29582, 2055, 1037, 4906, 1998, 2023, 15802, 2015, 2007, 1996, 2801, 2008, 2009, 2003, 2550, 2011, 2089, 6633, 4783, 12943, 1521, 23174, 7011, 7630, 1010, 2040, 3685, 2022, 23705, 2094, 2007, 2066, 1996, 28352, 19761, 9453, 1012, 2216, 8679, 2011, 1037, 11320, 3676, 9453, 2030, 2040, 2031, 2019, 7355, 3303, 2011, 2028, 1010, 3961, 2066, 2529, 9552, 1012, 2006, 2028, 6686, 1045, 2001, 2409, 2008, 1037, 28441, 1010, 2040, 2001, 5457, 2021, 2025, 6355, 1010, 2001, 2763, 5360, 2011, 1037, 11320, 3676, 9453, 2138, 2009, 2001, 1520, 12318, 2032, 19957, 1521, 1012, 1999, 1996, 2553, 1997, 4958, 9463, 18075, 1010, 2174, 1010, 2009, 2003, 7843, 2008, 2053, 4382, 2052, 2022, 2061, 1999, 23606, 2004, 2000, 8246, 2000, 3102, 1996, 5776, 2296, 2051, 2009, 2234, 1012, 2043, 3331, 1999, 2236, 3408, 2009, 2089, 2022, 2056, 2008, 4958, 9463, 18075, 2003, 2716, 2011, 2089, 6633, 4783, 1010, 2021, 2043, 2941, 12892, 2011, 1037, 2553, 1999, 1996, 2155, 1010, 9064, 2024, 2172, 2062, 9662, 2055, 1996, 3426, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9683179259300232, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "There is a difference of opinion as to which of the spirits is the most dangerous. The mayembe are sent to kill but their effects can be countered by medicine, even western medicine. The balubaale usually produce illnesses which are not susceptible to medicine but require the process of \u2018settling\u2019. A visit to hospital will only bring temporary remission and on return home it will not be long before the illness recurs. Thus, although less violent, the illnesses the balubaale produce are more difficult to cure and consequently many say that they are the most dangerous (Note 28 Note \u2014 It must be emphasised that ideas of causation are vague and it is impossible to draw up an ordered system. Ssekamwa (1967, p. 35) gives an account of a man who was affected by mayembe ag\u2019ekifalu who went mad. He got better in a few days in Butabika Hospital but relapsed on discharge. ).

It was known that I was treating epilepsy and because these illnesses are closely associated in the minds of the Baganda, I was approached on several occasions for treatment for leprosy. The Baganda believe all three to be highly infectious. In epilepsy the froth from the mouth and the urine which may be passed during a fit are thought of as particular carriers of the disease, but the sufferers are also thought to be able to spread the illness at all times and not only during a fit. The diagnosis of epilepsy is usually correct when people have been said to have ensimbu, but any chronic cough or skin disease will be feared to be akafuba and ebigenge respectively. All three illnesses are associated with a terrible stigma but in the case of epilepsy it sometimes seems more tragic since the patient may only be incapacitated for a day or two each month and for the remainder of the time will be perfectly well. Nevertheless, because of the fear of contagion they will typically have their own plates, cups and wash basin, and their clothes are washed separately.

Giel (1968) reports this belief in Ethiopia, Aall-Jilek (1965) in Tanzania and Leighton and Lambo (1963) in Nigeria. I myself have heard of it in many other areas that I have visited, and it seems that few people in this area do not have such a belief (Note 34 Note \u2014 On a brief visit to Eastern Uganda, I was told that the Karamojong did not believe epilepsy to be contagious. It should be remembered that it is ensimbu, the grand mal form of epilepsy, that is considered contagious by the Baganda. It is not surprising that Billington (1968, p. 565) found that a patient with petit mal was not stigmatised. He had not got ensimbu . ). Some Baganda believe that it can only be spread to those in the same family. This suggests that the mechanism is similar to that of the attacks of lubaale and mizimu, which are similarly limited. Indeed a few say that there are two types of epilepsy. If it has been caught from another then it may be spread to another, but if it came without the patient ever having been near anyone else with epilepsy then it may be of another variety which is not infectious. It is very often thought to be due to a lizard in the head which may either be there at birth and slowly grow until it begins to disturb the brain, or it may be introduced in later years by witchcraft. As it runs round and round in the head it causes dizziness and then the epileptic fit. A method of treatment is to cup the head and so remove it, but even this is not the final answer since the patient will still be left with a good deal of illness even if he does not actually have fits, and he will probably die soon. Even the most optimistic acknowledge that a considerable amount of further medication is required after the cupping. The belief that epilepsy is caused by witchcraft or a lizard in the head can co-exist at one and the same time with the idea that it is infectious. The idea of contagion is very non-specific and none could describe a mechanism by which it could be spread. Similarly while leprosy is thought to be contagious there is no notion of how it is spread and at the same time it may be thought to be due to witchcraft or a butterfly which touched the patient\u2019s skin leaving a light patch of powder from its wings.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 6772, 1999, 1996, 16514, 3267, 1997, 4958, 9463, 18075, 2003, 6923, 1999, 3088, 2148, 1997, 1996, 19604, 2021, 6854, 1010, 2045, 2003, 2210, 3906, 2006, 2009, 1012, 21025, 2884, 1006, 3380, 1007, 4311, 2023, 6772, 1999, 11154, 1010, 9779, 3363, 1011, 10147, 2571, 2243, 1006, 3551, 1007, 1999, 11959, 1998, 26873, 1998, 12559, 2080, 1006, 3699, 1007, 1999, 7387, 1012, 1045, 2870, 2031, 2657, 1997, 2009, 1999, 2116, 2060, 2752, 2008, 1045, 2031, 4716, 1010, 1998, 2009, 3849, 2008, 2261, 2111, 1999, 2023, 2181, 2079, 2025, 2031, 2107, 1037, 6772, 1006, 3602, 4090, 3602, 1517, 2006, 1037, 4766, 3942, 2000, 2789, 10031, 1010, 1045, 2001, 2409, 2008, 1996, 13173, 5302, 21958, 2106, 2025, 2903, 4958, 9463, 18075, 2000, 2022, 9530, 15900, 6313, 1012, 2009, 2323, 2022, 4622, 2008, 2009, 2003, 4372, 5332, 14905, 2226, 1010, 1996, 2882, 15451, 2433, 1997, 4958, 9463, 18075, 1010, 2008, 2003, 2641, 9530, 15900, 6313, 2011, 1996, 4524, 13832, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2025, 11341, 2008, 25640, 2669, 1006, 3380, 1010, 1052, 1012, 5179, 2629, 1007, 2179, 2008, 1037, 5776, 2007, 17268, 15451, 2001, 2025, 26453, 7315, 2098, 1012, 2002, 2018, 2025, 2288, 4372, 5332, 14905, 2226, 1012, 1007, 1012, 2070, 4524, 13832, 2903, 2008, 2009, 2064, 2069, 2022, 3659, 2000, 2216, 1999, 1996, 2168, 2155, 1012, 2023, 6083, 2008, 1996, 7337, 2003, 2714, 2000, 2008, 1997, 1996, 4491, 1997, 11320, 3676, 9453, 1998, 2771, 5831, 12274, 1010, 2029, 2024, 6660, 3132, 1012, 5262, 1037, 2261, 2360, 2008, 2045, 2024, 2048, 4127, 1997, 4958, 9463, 18075, 1012, 2065, 2009, 2038, 2042, 3236, 2013, 2178, 2059, 2009, 2089, 2022, 3659, 2000, 2178, 1010, 2021, 2065, 2009, 2234, 2302, 1996, 5776, 2412, 2383, 2042, 2379, 3087, 2842, 2007, 4958, 9463, 18075, 2059, 2009, 2089, 2022, 1997, 2178, 3528, 2029, 2003, 2025, 16514, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2200, 2411, 2245, 2000, 2022, 2349, 2000, 1037, 15450, 1999, 1996, 2132, 2029, 2089, 2593, 2022, 2045, 2012, 4182, 1998, 3254, 4982, 2127, 2009, 4269, 2000, 22995, 1996, 4167, 1010, 2030, 2009, 2089, 2022, 3107, 1999, 2101, 2086, 2011, 21599, 1012, 2004, 2009, 3216, 2461, 1998, 2461, 1999, 1996, 2132, 2009, 5320, 4487, 29212, 1998, 2059, 1996, 4958, 9463, 20746, 4906, 1012, 1037, 4118, 1997, 3949, 2003, 2000, 2452, 1996, 2132, 1998, 2061, 6366, 2009, 1010, 2021, 2130, 2023, 2003, 2025, 1996, 2345, 3437, 2144, 1996, 5776, 2097, 2145, 2022, 2187, 2007, 1037, 2204, 3066, 1997, 7355, 2130, 2065, 2002, 2515, 2025, 2941, 2031, 16142, 1010, 1998, 2002, 2097, 2763, 3280, 2574, 1012, 2130, 1996, 2087, 21931, 13399, 2008, 1037, 6196, 3815, 1997, 2582, 14667, 2003, 3223, 2044, 1996, 25076, 1012, 1996, 6772, 2008, 4958, 9463, 18075, 2003, 3303, 2011, 21599, 2030, 1037, 15450, 1999, 1996, 2132, 2064, 2522, 1011, 4839, 2012, 2028, 1998, 1996, 2168, 2051, 2007, 1996, 2801, 2008, 2009, 2003, 16514, 1012, 1996, 2801, 1997, 9530, 15900, 3258, 2003, 2200, 2512, 1011, 3563, 1998, 3904, 2071, 6235, 1037, 7337, 2011, 2029, 2009, 2071, 2022, 3659, 1012, 6660, 2096, 3393, 21572, 6508, 2003, 2245, 2000, 2022, 9530, 15900, 6313, 2045, 2003, 2053, 9366, 1997, 2129, 2009, 2003, 3659, 1998, 2012, 1996, 102]}, {"score": 0.9386657476425171, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "Epilepsy is thought to lead to spoiling ( okwonooneka ) of the brain, the word okwonooneka being stronger than the English word \u201cspoil\u201d and more nearly approaching the idea of destroying. The nearest analogy that people could give to what they thought was happening was that it was like butter melting in the sun. A spoilt brain may be present in those who are merely foolish, but it is also thought to be the inevitable outcome of untreated madness and epilepsy. Epilepsy is not usually thought to lead to madness but may lead to the mild form ( eddalu ly\u2019akazoole ). Drinking large amounts of alcohol and smoking hemp also spoil the brain. There is no doubt that the social isolation which epileptics are subjected to, especially in the case of children, can lead to failure in their social development, so that the brain certainly appears spoilt. A three year old girl was brought to me by her grandmother with whom she was living. She had a three month history of fits. Her grandmother said that her brain had already begun to \u2018spoil\u2019, as was shown in the way she appeared sullen and had become disobedient. Before the fits she had been sleeping in the same bed as her grandmother, but after the illness began she had to sleep on the other side of the room, and her friends were told not to play with her. Tablets were given to prevent the fits and the grandmother was told that the tablets prevented the disease from spreading, and the child was no longer to be separated. Her grandmother reported that she soon became her normal self again but unfortunately the old woman then died. The girl\u2019s father had died two years before, so after the grandmother\u2019s death the father\u2019s relations started looking after the child and began again to keep her well apart from others. Not unnaturally, the little girl was greatly upset, by the death of the grandmother and this, coupled with an apparent indifference to her welfare on the part of the father\u2019s relatives, such that everyone in the household found some reason why they were unable to attend for further medication, soon led to a recurrence of her fits and bad behaviour. This was quickly attributed to her brain being spoilt. The adults could see no alternative but that she should go to Butabika Hospital, since they were antagonistic to the mother of the girl who was presumed to have caused the death of her husband. They were eventually persuaded to let the mother take care of the child, although by custom she belonged to the father\u2019s family. The mother was instructed in giving medicine and within a few weeks the girl was behaving like a normal child and was apparently quite obedient. Some of the bad behaviour may be due to the direct effect of the illness, but almost certainly treating a child of three in the ways mentioned above must have contributed a great deal to her misbehaviour.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 4958, 9463, 18075, 2003, 2245, 2000, 2599, 2000, 27594, 2075, 1006, 7929, 19291, 7828, 19025, 1007, 1997, 1996, 4167, 1010, 1996, 2773, 7929, 19291, 7828, 19025, 2108, 6428, 2084, 1996, 2394, 2773, 1523, 27594, 1524, 1998, 2062, 3053, 8455, 1996, 2801, 1997, 9846, 1012, 1996, 7205, 23323, 2008, 2111, 2071, 2507, 2000, 2054, 2027, 2245, 2001, 6230, 2001, 2008, 2009, 2001, 2066, 12136, 13721, 1999, 1996, 3103, 1012, 1037, 27594, 2102, 4167, 2089, 2022, 2556, 1999, 2216, 2040, 2024, 6414, 13219, 1010, 2021, 2009, 2003, 2036, 2245, 2000, 2022, 1996, 13418, 9560, 1997, 4895, 7913, 4383, 12013, 1998, 4958, 9463, 18075, 1012, 4958, 9463, 18075, 2003, 2025, 2788, 2245, 2000, 2599, 2000, 12013, 2021, 2089, 2599, 2000, 1996, 10256, 2433, 1006, 3968, 9305, 2226, 1048, 2100, 1521, 9875, 23221, 2571, 1007, 1012, 5948, 2312, 8310, 1997, 6544, 1998, 9422, 19610, 2361, 2036, 27594, 1996, 4167, 1012, 2045, 2003, 2053, 4797, 2008, 1996, 2591, 12477, 2029, 4958, 9463, 20746, 2015, 2024, 13532, 2000, 1010, 2926, 1999, 1996, 2553, 1997, 2336, 1010, 2064, 2599, 2000, 4945, 1999, 2037, 2591, 2458, 1010, 2061, 2008, 1996, 4167, 5121, 3544, 27594, 2102, 1012, 1037, 2093, 2095, 2214, 2611, 2001, 2716, 2000, 2033, 2011, 2014, 7133, 2007, 3183, 2016, 2001, 2542, 1012, 2016, 2018, 1037, 2093, 3204, 2381, 1997, 16142, 1012, 2014, 7133, 2056, 2008, 2014, 4167, 2018, 2525, 5625, 2000, 1520, 27594, 1521, 1010, 2004, 2001, 3491, 1999, 1996, 2126, 2016, 2596, 21396, 7770, 1998, 2018, 2468, 4487, 6499, 8270, 11638, 1012, 2077, 1996, 16142, 2016, 2018, 2042, 5777, 1999, 1996, 2168, 2793, 2004, 2014, 7133, 1010, 2021, 2044, 1996, 7355, 2211, 2016, 2018, 2000, 3637, 2006, 1996, 2060, 2217, 1997, 1996, 2282, 1010, 1998, 2014, 2814, 2020, 2409, 2025, 2000, 2377, 2007, 2014, 1012, 17596, 2020, 2445, 2000, 4652, 1996, 16142, 1998, 1996, 7133, 2001, 2409, 2008, 1996, 17596, 8729, 1996, 4295, 2013, 9359, 1010, 1998, 1996, 2775, 2001, 2053, 2936, 2000, 2022, 5459, 1012, 2014, 7133, 2988, 2008, 2016, 2574, 2150, 2014, 3671, 2969, 2153, 2021, 6854, 1996, 2214, 2450, 2059, 2351, 1012, 1996, 2611, 1521, 1055, 2269, 2018, 2351, 2048, 2086, 2077, 1010, 2061, 2044, 1996, 7133, 1521, 1055, 2331, 1996, 2269, 1521, 1055, 4262, 2318, 2559, 2044, 1996, 2775, 1998, 2211, 2153, 2000, 2562, 2014, 2092, 4237, 2013, 2500, 1012, 2025, 21242, 2135, 1010, 1996, 2210, 2611, 2001, 6551, 6314, 1010, 2011, 1996, 2331, 1997, 1996, 7133, 1998, 2023, 1010, 11211, 2007, 2019, 6835, 25920, 2000, 2014, 7574, 2006, 1996, 2112, 1997, 1996, 2269, 1521, 1055, 9064, 1010, 2107, 2008, 3071, 1999, 1996, 4398, 2179, 2070, 3114, 2339, 2027, 2020, 4039, 2000, 5463, 2005, 2582, 14667, 1010, 2574, 2419, 2000, 1037, 28667, 3126, 24413, 1997, 2014, 16142, 1998, 2919, 9164, 1012, 2023, 2001, 2855, 7108, 2000, 2014, 4167, 2108, 27594, 2102, 1012, 1996, 6001, 2071, 2156, 2053, 4522, 2021, 2008, 2016, 2323, 2175, 2000, 2021, 28518, 2912, 2902, 1010, 2144, 2027, 2020, 17379, 2594, 2000, 1996, 2388, 1997, 1996, 2611, 2040, 2001, 14609, 2000, 2031, 3303, 1996, 2331, 1997, 2014, 3129, 1012, 2027, 2020, 2776, 11766, 2000, 2292, 1996, 2388, 2202, 102]}, {"score": 0.7499610781669617, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "Shame, however, is not the only reason for not actually saying the name of the illness.

Then the fire is lighted in the huts and on it are placed the pots filled with water in which the vegetables are to be cooked. These pots ( e modi, 'modio ) are not made by the Masai themselves, but are bought from sedentary tribes or also from the Wandor\u00f3bo, who presumably learned the potter's art from them. They are a foot high and globular. In contrast to the warriors, all the occupants of the family kraal, especially since the cattle epidemics, eat vegetable food which they buy from the neighboring peoples, since they themselves do not engage in any agriculture at all. Their favorite foods, however, are, of course, milk, meat, and blood. Milk is always drunk by healthy people uncooked, as fresh ( e n gule ) or sour ( e n gule naoto ); boiled milk is food for the sick and as such is usually mixed with pulverized grains of ol lodoa (Maesa lanceolata) . Sheep milk is especially popular because of its very high fat content. Blood of cattle, sheep, and goats is drunk fresh or eaten in the clotted state. Milk mixed with fresh or 33 cooked blood ( en jiw ot ) is greatly appreciated; this drink is highly esteemed as invalid soup for the wounded. Cheese making is unknown. Butter is made by agitating the cream in a large gourd-bottle ( en diagolgol ). Fat, rendered in a pot, is used as an ingredient in other foods, especially meat broth, but is also drunk without any admixture. Meat is prepared without adding salt; it is cooked either with various spices or roasted on a stick at the open fire. One does not eat in one day cooked meat and milk /Ill. 13 appears here/ together 1 This was also forbidden for the Hebrews, according to the 2nd Book of Moses 23, 19-34, 26, passages which are part of the so-called Yahwist documents, that is, the oldest sources of the Pentateuch. , because the latter together with the ol mokotan spice (bark of 33 cont. Ill. 13. Women cleaning the kraal. Albizzia anthelmintica ) always used in the cooking of meat is supposed to cause severe diarrhea. Therefore milk that is offered is often refused in the hope that a meal of meat will be obtained on the same day. One who wishes to partake of both foods in one day -- and where is there a Masai who could resist an invitation to a meal of meat?! -- vomits first before eating the meat, for which he produces the necessary stimulus by means of a blade of grass stuck in the throat. If one has eaten cooked meat today, then 34 one first drinks some blood in the morning before the milk, not out of considerations of health, but rather because it is believed that the livestock would give less milk as a consequence of neglecting this custom. Bringing milk into contact with meat is most scrupulously avoided, because, according to the general view, through that the udder of the cow from whom that milk came would become permanently diseased. For this reason the 34 cont. Masai only most reluctantly and infrequently sell cow's milk, for the buyer indeed could in the above-mentioned manner make their cows sick with it.

The children belonging to the family of the bride and to her relatives drive up a head of cattle belonging to the bride's father. The head of cattle is immediately slaughtered to feed the guests. Bride and groom are festively adorned, that is, above all 48 rubbed on the upper body and head with a paint made out of beef suet and red ocher. Those present sit in a large circle, one half of which is formed by the bridegroom with the men and the other by the bride with the women and children, so that the bride and groom are opposite each other. Whereas the guests partake heartily of the foods, the bridal couple may not take anything because they would become sick from it, would get a rash around their mouths, but rather they must bear patiently a flood of good teachings and advice. After finishing the banquet and the dance following it, which does not come to an end until shortly before midnight, everyone retires; the bride goes with her mother into the latter's hut, the bridegroom together with other warriors into another one. On the following day people again assemble for dancing. On this day only two sheep are slaughtered; the bridegroom brings one, his father-in-law gives the other. Women and girls rub their bodies and skin aprons with the fat of the animals.

During the operation the boy sits with legs apart on the leather apron spread out on the ground. After it, the wounded part is washed with milk, which, caught in the apron together with the blood lost, is carried by the circumcised boy, who strides backwards for this, into his mother's hut and is poured on the ground there. An agent to stanch the blood is not used. During the circumcision itself the parents of the boy remain in their hut, for if the latter moans or cries out from the pain, they are punished with abusive 63 cont. words and blows by the assembled warriors, because they did not rear their son to have the hardening and self-control necessary for a warrior, while the weakling is reviled for a long time afterwards as eb iryo = coward, or t or on o = the bad one. After the circumcision all the men of the neighborhood gather in the kraal, where they are regaled with meat and honey beer by the fathers of the ones just circumcised, after the latter have kindled a fire with juniper twigs ( Juniperus procera ).

People joke and laugh and everyone seems to want to outshout the others. The warriors boast of alleged heroic deeds in former wars and discuss the prospects of the ones circumcised that day on their first military expedition, which will perhaps take them to this or that region, where they themselves had made an attack only a short time before. The fathers dream of their sons' future heroic deeds and are happy at the thought of the rich booty with which the budding warriors will augment the paternal herds. Suddenly the glances of a few who had just been joking darken and turn toward a distant hut at whose door a solitary old man is sitting. They jump up and go toward him with quick steps. The angry expression on their faces matches their rough and abruptly uttered invectives and threats, in which one hears the reproaches that the old man has brought up his son to be a weak coward, who during the circumcision betrayed his pain by a twitching of facial muscles and a half-suppressed groan, which tehy, however, jeeringly compare to the roar of pain of a bull being cut. The old man has quickly fled from their imprecations into his hut, and his attackers vent their wrath on two gourd bottles of hiney beer left standing, which they knock over and 63 cont. trample underfoot.

The shorn hair is tossed into the thorn fence of the kraal. Beard hair and such lashes that grow back into the eye are plucked out with tweezers (Fig. 63 [ ol bud et ]).

Axillary hair 148 and eyebrows are shaved. Women also shave the pubic hair, whereas men pluck it out with the fingers or tweezers. Young warriors let the hair grow and, when it has the necessary length, twist it between two fingers, through which apparently arise little balls, which, on closer inspection, prove to be spirals interlaced and rolled together. Somewhat later it is twisted together into strands ( ol babet, el babet ) with red paint, a mixture of animal fat and red earth, which hang entangled around the head. Furthermore they are lengthened by twisting in fibers of the bark of the baobab ( ol m es er a ) and of another tree called ol ret\u00e9ti , in order to form out of that the braid-coiffure peculiar to the Masai warriors, but adopted by many neighboring tribes (Fig. 64, 65, 66 [ ol daiga, el daigan ]). For this the hair is parted crosswise over the head from ear to ear, and then that of the front half of the head is divided into three parts, one over the forehead, the other two at the 148 cont. temples, whereupon the tips of the strands are wrapped with bast to the length of an inch. The back hair, lengthened up to 50 centimeters, is placed around a foot-long stick and on this wrapped tightly with bast or goat leather scraped thin, so that it forms a stiff braid ( ol daiga ) reaching to the waist. Over this braid one not infrequently finds one to three smaller ones. Often the tips of the little temple braids (sing. ol babeda; el babed l e n goscho ) are joined with that of the little forehead braid ( ol babeda l e n gomum ) and the former tied together under the chin with a string (made of fibers) 1 This hair style has the purpose of protecting the head from the harmful influences of the sun's rays. For that, one first let the hair grow long and, since the long strands fell annoyingly into the face at every movement, put it together into \u201cbraids.\u201d The Tatoga helped themselves more simply, in that they shaved the front part of the head and left the protection of the thick padding of hair at the back part of the head. .

This is done by three different methods. To remove the lower middle incisors, which among children is done for the first time at an early age and is then repeated after the change of teeth, one sticks the thin iron blade of an ax between the teeth and levers them out while tapping moderately hard laterally several times with a stick against the blade. The other front teeth are taken out only when they are already quite loose. One ties a string of cattle tendon around the crown of the tooth and a fist-sized stone at the other end of it. When this is done, the operator, for a very loose tooth, simply lets the stone fall, or, with one resting more firmly, throws it down. To remove a molar, one places a little stick almost finger-thick and approximately 20 centimeters long, with its lower end, notched swallowtail-like, against the tooth, and, to be sure, from inside, at right angles to the dental arch and then directs several vigorous blows against the free end of the stick.

Now whether the patient or his bearers did not agree with the plan to embark on a two-day journey is beside the point; in any case, the patient, on the following day, was brought to a rather large livestock-kraal to which the aforementioned surgeon, who, incidentally, lived six hours away, was fetched. He found a large, suppurating wound, out of which the lower end of the tibia projected, the marrow of which was likewise suppurating. The ol abani , proceeding from the wound, now cut open the lower leg on the tibia up to a handbreadth above the ankle and peeled out the lower end of the bone equally far.

Taking them out, is certainly more difficult than to take out other foreign bodies, and it will therefore suffice to discuss the method used for this, since those for the removal of more harmless objects will follow from that. First of all, it leads to an operation, of course, only if -- which is seldom the case -- the arrow is not poisoned or if -- which fortunately often occurs -- the poison has become ineffective through decomposition. Since in battle the torso as a rule is protected by shield and beside the leather cape also often deflects the arrow or at any rate greatly diminishes its force, deeper arrow wounds usually occur occur only on the extremities. If the entire arrow remains stuck in the wound, the operator knows immediately, without a lengthy examination, where the point rests and how it lies. If there are only muscles lying in front of the point in the direction of the shot, he quickly pushes the arrow through and draws out point and tang on the other side, the shaft on the shot-entry side. On the other hand, if bones lie in front of the arrow point, this method is automatically eliminated. Simply pulling out the arrow through the shot-entry 194 cont. opening is, however, impossible because of the barbs. The surgeon now has two methods. Which one he will employ depends upon the individual case. He either twists the arrow around in the wound until the barbs have become so filled and coated with muscle fibers that they are no longer 195 able to offer resistance to a pull backwards, or he treats the arrow like a broken-off one, for which he has the following ways of operating. The point palpable by contact from the outside is removed in such a manner that one makes on the shortest path between it and the skin an incision as wide as is necessary in order to permit drawing it through. Since no forceps are at the disposal of the operator, but rather he must grasp with his fingers the arrow point to be removed, the incision must be quite large. A hidden point is sought in the following manner: the surgeon inserts his finger into the shot-entry channel and cuts through at the end of the fingertips from the outside inward, then sticks his finger into this opening and gropes farther into the shot channel, in order to make a second incision where his fingertip now lies.

The aforementioned amulet ring ( ol geretti ) protects one against the effect of magic made by another Masai. Women who go into the neighboring areas of foreign tribes to buy vegetables especially protect themselves from their sorcery. They smear their foreheads and cheeks with cattle dung or wear around their necks a cord on which are strung small, split sticks.

They even make themselves responsible, relative to the intensity of the sexual intercourse, for the slow dying of the animal struck by the poisoned arrow. The poison is smeared on the arrow point with a wooden spatula, and, in order to protect the dried substance from crumbling or from dissolving in damp weather (since it is very hygroscopic), it is wrapped with a strip of thin antelope skin that is dehaired and made soft by being rubbed with fat. The poison acts very quickly, and, to be sure, by suddenly stopping the heart activity. In the case of a genet shot in the abdomen, breathing difficulty set in after five minutes, along with rapid movements of the nostrils and violent, cramplike muscle twitchings of the body and limbs. With brief interruptions of a quarter to a third of a minute the symptoms were repeated and increased in intensity. The pupils dilated to a circle. Nine minutes and 18 seconds after the shot the pupils, up to then blue-black, suddenly became sea-green, and, with violent twitching, death came. With quite fresh poison death is supposed to come in even a shorter time. In the steppe the poison is tested by shooting an antelope with an arrow newly poisoned. If on the trail of the fleeing animal one finds fresh urine and excrement, teh poison is regarded as acting too weakly. Good poison put in the foot of a live turtle must lead to its death before it has crawled five or six steps away. Neither the Asa nor the Wandorobo are acquainted with a physiological anecdote.

Johnston, in commenting upon this, says ( The Uganda Protectorats, p. 803): \u2018It may be this explanation has been invented recently to explain a very ancient custom inherited by the Masai from the Nilotic stock, which was their origin; for amongst these people the removal of the lower incisor teeth is a very common practice.\u2019 Hinde's explanation, however, appears to be very widely spread. .

The official version is that Lenana was chosen by the elders of most of the clans and districts on his father's death, but that Sendeyo refused to acknowledge him, and was supported by the 'L-oitai (i. e. the Masai of the 'L-oita sub-district, near Kilima Njaro), with whom he lived for many years. The warriors of the two parties frequently met in deadly strife, and raided each other's cattle. In 1902 Sendeyo gave up the hopeless conflict, and agreed to acknowledge his brother as chief. He now lives not far from Naivasha.

The popular view is to note the excellence of their diet and way of life by normal African standards (Orr and Gilks 1931). The more sombre view is to accept that only the most robust children have a chance of survival and natural selection is a major factor in the level of health (Merker 1904:334). The true balance between these is hard to assess. The Matapato are reluctant to discuss family tragedies and they dispose of dead children unobtrusively. The general absence of congenital disabilities inevitably raises questions regarding the fate of defective babies. 3 The term en-tomononi refers most commonly to a young mother whose hair reveals her ritual state, but it also applies to certain other ritualised roles including the infant itself. Apart from emphasising the weakness of her condition, informants offered no derivation of this term. In the related language Bari, however, a phonetically similar term, tomunyan , is translated as \u2019tenderness, feebleness, weakness\u2019 (Spagnolo 1960:300). In its male form, ol-tomononi may refer to a generally propitious elder with children, who is especially suitable for a prominent role in any ceremony. It is held that any deformity could indicate some past sin dogging either parent, but God condoned this birth and God alone should choose the moment of death.

The juxtaposition of large numbers of older men and younger men sharply differentiated by age highlights their differences. The maturation of the moran is a fact of life that arouses ambivalence, clearly expressed in Episode 2 and other incidents of the kind. Even the firestick patrons, whose future is ritually linked with that of their moran wards, have a vested interest in delaying the reality of the present. This is to suggest that the kind of insight offered by some informants, that the danger from \u2018eyes\u2019 emanates from society at large, could logically be extended to interpreting the dangers that are felt to surround eunoto . Episode 4 . Seizing the ritual leaders . The migration to the eunoto site had to take place on the fifth day of a Maasai lunar month, reckoned from the morning when the old moon was no longer visible (24th April 1977). When the time came, moran feasting in the forest nearby were summoned and the number in the villages increased overnight from about 100 moran to perhaps 450. This was the first time that the whole age-group had ever been assembled in one spot. Forty-nine of the moran were selected to lead the procession. Singing emosiroi , they were followed by a herd of forty-eight white heifers and a young black bull, and then by all the other moran. They were blessed by a manyata-mother, who dipped a handful of grass into a milk gourd and flicked milk at them as they passed through her gateway and out of the larger village. This was the false start, and when all the moran had passed out, the patrons ordered them to disband. (Coining the metaphor, the ritual rebirth had been aborted.) The procession proper had to wait until the manyata-mothers packed their donkeys and had left to be at the eunoto site before the moran. During this lull, the patrons directed the moran to process between the villages performing their lion dance. Some patrons, who were trying to slow down the tempo, were visibly moved, two with tears down their cheeks. It was the lion dance, I was told, that stirred their memories - and it was being performed too fast. In other respects, the patrons clearly showed that they had total control and were determined to dominate this occasion. Throughout the day they marshalled the moran for instruction, for dancing, and for the chores of moving, and one or two lashed out with their long whips on impulse. The moran seemed drained of their earlier confidence, for the migration was a prelude to the evening climax when the identities of the ritual leader and his deputy would be revealed. Later, several moran described to me their feelings of apprehension on this day: a dread of the approach of evening and of the awful possibility that they themselves or perhaps one of their close friends might be seized as a ritual leader. One moran whose ancestry made him ineligible expressed his own vicarious fears. Whoever they were, two of his age mates were to be plucked away, violating the manyata bond of sharing in everything including a common destiny. The ritual leaders were to be condemned to an uncertain future, even an early death, and he felt as though a part of his own self was condemned. Eventually all was packed for the migration. The procession was led by a few firestick patrons who knew the secret location, a spot about four miles further south. Then came the manyata-mothers with their laden donkeys, some straggled from time to time, and others stopped to readjust their loads, halting the procession that followed. Then came the remaining patrons, and at their rear a few with whips to control the pace of the moran, so that they did not overtake the straggling women. Then came the moran in four files, two for Maparasha and one each for Meto and Silale, wearing such lionskin trophies and ostrich feather headdresses as they had. They carried their shields, held high their manyata flags, and raised their spears to the rhythm of their lion dance. Each time the procession was halted by the patrons, the dancing would intensify and minor epidemics of shaking broke out: a yelp, some shaking, and then more yelps and more shaking. Possibly thirty of the moran shook, while many more were shivering. Finally at the tailend of the procession, came a file of about thirty girls, escorted by four moran. By the time that the body of the procession arrived at the eunoto site, the women had already been directed by the leading firestick patrons to build their huts in a large circle. This was the point, incidentally at which the violent eunoto affray had erupted in Purko in 1945 when rival manyat competed for the prime position in the village. In Matapato, there was no prime position to be fought over; and here in any event, manyata rivalries appeared to have dissipated before the migration. When the moran arrived, they were directed to fetch logs for the fire and to cut thorn branches for the village fence. In a matter of hours an unremarkable stretch of open bushland overshadowed by the mountain was transformed into a joint manyata village. Meanwhile, the patrons blessed the forty-nine young cattle in the centre of the village; and then holding down the young black bull, they kindled the manyata fire on his back. The manner of lighting this fire is popularly related to the misfortune that dogs the ritual leader. According to one version, it is the unpropitiousness of lighting it on a living bull that has the effect of a firestick patrons' curse. According to another it is \u2018medicine\u2019 provided by the Prophet which they put in the flames that has the effect of sorcery. 3 The fracas concerned respectively the Ngorisho R among the Loodokilani, the Meruturud L and the Nyankusi R among the Purko. The Annual Report for 1945 (AR/Kaj-Nar/1945:3) presumably refers obliquely to this last incident. Various moran looked on, aware that their patrons were performing an essential preliminary to installing the two incumbents in a matter of hours. As the shadows lengthened and the new moon was just visible, all the huts had been erected and the moran were called to the village. Most of them were quickly rounded up, but some were found lurking in the bush nearby, apparently hoping that their absence would not be noticed. There were rumours that several had already run away. Once assembled, the moran were mustered round the patrons' fire, singing emosiroi and facing inwards in a double circle, about thirty yards in diameter with a pathway between the outer and inner rings. Then further delays prolonged the suspense when it was discovered that some of the manyata-mothers had not yet taken a flame from the patrons' fire to kindle their own hearths. This prompted a routine check on all huts. Eventually the patrons were satisfied that the procedure for seizing the two ritual leaders could continue. A posse wearing capes and consisting of the three moran spokesmen and four strong aides ambled round the pathway between the two rings. They glanced over the moran as they passed, and were poised at any moment to seize the ritual leader. In the gathering twilight, they continued to circumambulate for perhaps twenty minutes while the other moran continued the slow measured tones of emosiroi with tense shivery expressions. One or two yelped and started to shake from time to time. As darkness closed in, it only became clear that the posse had seized the ritual leader when there was a cry and a scuffle. Other moran near the spot joined in to hold him, while a woman's apron was forced over his shoulders. Shivering, screaming, and throwing his limbs violently in all directions, he was half dragged and half carried to his mother's hut and forced to sit beside her fire opposite three firestick patrons. For a time he continued to scream and seemed almost delirious, while his mother and his young brother, who was a manyata herdboy, were also overcome with grief. About fifteen of his closer moran friends gathered, singing to comfort him, and a cow with male calf was tethered in front of the hut as a gift from his age-group. The commotion eventually subsided and the moran were again assembled into their rings to sing emosiroi ; and the same procedure was followed to seize and instal the deputy ritual leader. Once this too had been completed, the circle was finally broken. With a sense of general relief there was dancing and high spirits in various parts of the village, by groups of moran with their girls, and also by manyata-mothers in their own groups. For the first time that day, the festive atmosphere returned and continued into the night. The Pleiades star cluster was by now barely visible in the evening sky, and the eunoto sacrifice, which formed the next climax, could not be performed until the cluster had reappeared in the early morning in two months time. The sheer size of the gathering in these hard times could not be sustained for more than a day. Next morning, there was a general exodus by both elders and moran, seeking food elsewhere. Some moran made their way back to their forest camps. The parting gift for elders was one mug of tea to be shared among every four men, and it was accepted that there was no point in remonstrating for more. There was no more. Those that remained in the vicinity were primarily the manyata moran and their mothers.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2004, 1996, 2051, 2005, 3048, 2013, 2037, 5741, 4731, 2000, 1996, 26070, 11439, 2609, 9891, 2379, 1010, 1996, 2116, 4017, 2024, 2587, 2011, 2512, 1011, 2116, 6790, 17866, 1998, 2027, 22806, 2004, 1037, 2878, 2287, 1011, 2177, 1012, 1996, 10439, 2890, 10222, 12742, 2791, 1997, 2061, 19170, 2854, 4193, 2023, 2693, 7126, 2000, 3857, 2039, 1037, 3168, 1997, 6686, 1012, 1996, 26070, 11439, 2609, 2993, 2003, 2921, 3595, 2061, 2008, 2009, 3685, 2022, 17214, 4842, 2098, 2007, 25828, 1012, 1037, 9474, 2240, 1997, 16833, 2100, 1520, 4200, 1521, 3024, 2011, 1996, 12168, 2003, 9551, 2006, 2296, 6130, 2013, 4540, 2000, 4540, 2005, 1996, 2693, 1012, 2045, 2003, 2036, 1037, 6270, 2707, 2000, 27345, 28616, 13028, 9816, 2013, 1996, 9230, 5372, 2008, 4076, 1012, 2023, 2003, 1037, 4323, 2008, 2003, 5567, 2101, 2008, 2154, 2007, 1996, 8272, 1997, 1996, 8887, 3003, 1010, 2005, 2002, 2205, 2003, 2245, 2000, 27345, 28616, 13028, 9816, 2013, 2010, 2287, 14711, 2040, 3582, 2032, 2000, 6422, 9021, 1012, 2023, 5142, 2007, 8767, 2013, 16491, 2749, 19680, 2015, 2007, 1996, 8651, 2008, 1996, 2287, 1011, 2177, 1997, 17866, 13595, 2083, 26070, 11439, 1012, 2009, 6017, 2019, 24655, 5670, 1999, 1996, 4353, 1997, 2373, 2007, 2287, 2062, 3227, 1012, 1996, 18414, 18413, 9331, 19234, 1997, 2312, 3616, 1997, 3080, 2273, 1998, 3920, 2273, 9249, 24374, 2011, 2287, 11637, 2037, 5966, 1012, 1996, 13523, 18924, 1997, 1996, 17866, 2003, 1037, 2755, 1997, 2166, 2008, 12098, 15441, 2015, 2572, 5638, 17479, 5897, 1010, 4415, 5228, 1999, 2792, 1016, 1998, 2060, 10444, 1997, 1996, 2785, 1012, 2130, 1996, 8769, 26348, 13497, 1010, 3005, 2925, 2003, 8887, 2135, 5799, 2007, 2008, 1997, 2037, 17866, 11682, 1010, 2031, 1037, 26003, 3037, 1999, 29391, 1996, 4507, 1997, 1996, 2556, 1012, 2023, 2003, 2000, 6592, 2008, 1996, 2785, 1997, 12369, 3253, 2011, 2070, 28694, 2015, 1010, 2008, 1996, 5473, 2013, 1520, 2159, 1521, 7861, 5162, 4570, 2013, 2554, 2012, 2312, 1010, 2071, 11177, 2135, 2022, 3668, 2000, 25455, 1996, 16796, 2008, 2024, 2371, 2000, 15161, 26070, 11439, 1012, 2792, 1018, 1012, 24681, 1996, 8887, 4177, 1012, 1996, 9230, 2000, 1996, 26070, 11439, 2609, 2018, 2000, 2202, 2173, 2006, 1996, 3587, 2154, 1997, 1037, 5003, 16782, 2072, 11926, 3204, 1010, 29072, 2098, 2013, 1996, 2851, 2043, 1996, 2214, 4231, 2001, 2053, 2936, 5710, 1006, 13386, 2258, 3355, 1007, 1012, 2043, 1996, 2051, 2234, 1010, 17866, 9831, 2075, 1999, 1996, 3224, 3518, 2020, 11908, 1998, 1996, 2193, 1999, 1996, 4731, 3445, 11585, 2013, 2055, 2531, 17866, 2000, 3383, 10332, 1012, 2023, 2001, 1996, 2034, 2051, 2008, 1996, 2878, 2287, 1011, 2177, 2018, 2412, 2042, 9240, 1999, 2028, 3962, 1012, 5659, 1011, 3157, 1997, 1996, 17866, 2020, 3479, 2000, 2599, 1996, 14385, 1012, 4823, 7861, 20049, 26692, 1010, 2027, 2020, 2628, 2011, 1037, 14906, 1997, 5659, 1011, 2809, 2317, 2002, 23780, 2015, 1998, 1037, 2402, 2304, 7087, 1010, 1998, 2059, 2011, 2035, 1996, 2060, 17866, 1012, 2027, 2020, 10190, 2011, 1037, 2116, 6790, 1011, 2388, 1010, 2040, 13537, 1037, 9210, 1997, 5568, 2046, 1037, 6501, 2175, 3126, 2094, 1998, 12777, 6501, 2012, 2068, 2004, 2027, 2979, 2083, 2014, 102]}, {"score": 0.9350372552871704, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "A review of the list of these taboos which follows will disclose much over-lapping.

After the Muslim naming ceremony on the seventh day, the mother returns to her parents\u2019 home with her baby, and remains there for a period of six months or longer, during which she performs the prescribed post-natal ablutions daily for five months. This custom, known as bangwalle, has many different variations, but its performance for the first birth is normative. On completion of bangwalle the mother returns to her husband\u2019s compound loaded with gifts from her kin, and for the first time in her husband\u2019s home will suckle her infant without any pressure or compulsion being necessary. But throughout their lives, a parent of either sex and the first-born child observe a rigorous avoidance-relation, which is hardly relaxed even in private and when the child is fully grown. As the very full acount in the text illustrates (pp. 1 sqq.), social sanctions compel conformity to this behaviour, both during the period of ablutions and thereafter. The entire complex is best understood as a rite de passage, marking the transition in status to parenthood and full social maturity, and the lifelong avoidance-relation, which is extended by Fulani to the second and third child, and by Hausa-speaking Habe and Fulani to the next-born in greater or less degree, if the first child dies in infancy, gives a permanent expression to this new status. Similarly the post-natal ablutions, which are carried out for successive births, are probably best understood as extensions of ritual activity on the first childbirth rather than as measures of preventive hygiene (which the Hausa declare them to be), since such ablutions are not performed for stillbirths or miscarriages, and may be brought to an early conclusion if the mother is unable to bear the washing with nearly boiling water; if this happens, alternative \u2018medicines\u2019, herbal and Islamic, are employed.", "predicted_label": 0, "input_ids": [101, 2178, 14034, 2139, 6019, 1997, 4187, 5197, 3138, 2173, 2006, 1996, 6686, 1997, 1037, 2450, 1521, 1055, 2034, 27162, 1012, 2044, 1996, 5152, 10324, 5103, 2006, 1996, 5066, 2154, 1010, 1996, 2388, 5651, 2000, 2014, 3008, 1521, 2188, 2007, 2014, 3336, 1010, 1998, 3464, 2045, 2005, 1037, 2558, 1997, 2416, 2706, 2030, 2936, 1010, 2076, 2029, 2016, 10438, 1996, 16250, 2695, 1011, 17489, 11113, 7630, 9285, 3679, 2005, 2274, 2706, 1012, 2023, 7661, 1010, 2124, 2004, 9748, 9628, 2063, 1010, 2038, 2116, 2367, 8358, 1010, 2021, 2049, 2836, 2005, 1996, 2034, 4182, 2003, 20692, 6024, 1012, 2006, 6503, 1997, 9748, 9628, 2063, 1996, 2388, 5651, 2000, 2014, 3129, 1521, 1055, 7328, 8209, 2007, 9604, 2013, 2014, 12631, 1010, 1998, 2005, 1996, 2034, 2051, 1999, 2014, 3129, 1521, 1055, 2188, 2097, 11891, 2571, 2014, 10527, 2302, 2151, 3778, 2030, 27638, 2108, 4072, 1012, 2021, 2802, 2037, 3268, 1010, 1037, 6687, 1997, 2593, 3348, 1998, 1996, 2034, 1011, 2141, 2775, 11949, 1037, 20001, 24685, 1011, 7189, 1010, 2029, 2003, 6684, 8363, 2130, 1999, 2797, 1998, 2043, 1996, 2775, 2003, 3929, 4961, 1012, 2004, 1996, 2200, 2440, 9353, 21723, 1999, 1996, 3793, 24899, 1006, 4903, 1012, 1015, 5490, 4160, 1012, 1007, 1010, 2591, 17147, 4012, 11880, 23758, 3012, 2000, 2023, 9164, 1010, 2119, 2076, 1996, 2558, 1997, 11113, 7630, 9285, 1998, 6920, 1012, 1996, 2972, 3375, 2003, 2190, 5319, 2004, 1037, 14034, 2139, 6019, 1010, 10060, 1996, 6653, 1999, 3570, 2000, 6687, 9021, 1998, 2440, 2591, 16736, 1010, 1998, 1996, 13506, 24685, 1011, 7189, 1010, 2029, 2003, 3668, 2011, 11865, 21141, 2000, 1996, 2117, 1998, 2353, 2775, 1010, 1998, 2011, 5292, 10383, 1011, 4092, 5292, 4783, 1998, 11865, 21141, 2000, 1996, 2279, 1011, 2141, 1999, 3618, 2030, 2625, 3014, 1010, 2065, 1996, 2034, 2775, 8289, 1999, 22813, 1010, 3957, 1037, 4568, 3670, 2000, 2023, 2047, 3570, 1012, 6660, 1996, 2695, 1011, 17489, 11113, 7630, 9285, 1010, 2029, 2024, 3344, 2041, 2005, 11165, 18250, 1010, 2024, 2763, 2190, 5319, 2004, 14305, 1997, 8887, 4023, 2006, 1996, 2034, 27162, 2738, 2084, 2004, 5761, 1997, 4652, 3512, 19548, 1006, 2029, 1996, 5292, 10383, 13520, 2068, 2000, 2022, 1007, 1010, 2144, 2107, 11113, 7630, 9285, 2024, 2025, 2864, 2005, 2145, 17706, 26830, 2030, 28616, 21539, 2015, 1010, 1998, 2089, 2022, 2716, 2000, 2019, 2220, 7091, 2065, 1996, 2388, 2003, 4039, 2000, 4562, 1996, 12699, 2007, 3053, 16018, 2300, 1025, 2065, 2023, 6433, 1010, 4522, 1520, 20233, 1521, 1010, 27849, 1998, 5499, 1010, 2024, 4846, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.6446307897567749, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "When I was two years old and it was time to wean me from my mother, Zetanku my father\u2019s old slave took me to live with her until I forgot about the breast.

In the main, the black spirits are held to be pagan and live in the bush, while the white spirits are thought of as Moslem and live in the city. At times, however, other criteria are brought into play as when Massak'i, \u201cthe weaver,\u201d is declared to be a white spirit because he weaves white cloth; or Ba'awzini, \u201cthe Touareg,\u201d is called white because the Touareg are a light-skinned people. It is also said that a spirit may be white for the man who worships him, while he is black for everyone else. Classification, however, is not a major consideration, and there consequently is some doubt regarding the category to which many of the spirits should be assigned. 5 The division of spirits into white and Moslem on the one hand, and black and pagan on the other, is of Mohammedan origin. The present confusion in the classification of the spirits is thus largely due to the fact that these categories have been superimposed on a native division of the spirits into those of town and bush. It is maintained that only the black spirits cause illness while the white are harmless, but closer investigation soon discloses that any spirits can be malevolent as well as good. In general, however, the most malignant diseases are held to be caused by black spirits.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 8633, 2024, 2788, 6219, 2004, 2317, 2030, 2204, 1010, 1998, 2304, 2030, 4763, 1012, 1999, 1996, 2364, 1010, 1996, 2304, 8633, 2024, 2218, 2000, 2022, 14318, 1998, 2444, 1999, 1996, 5747, 1010, 2096, 1996, 2317, 8633, 2024, 2245, 1997, 2004, 9587, 25016, 2213, 1998, 2444, 1999, 1996, 2103, 1012, 2012, 2335, 1010, 2174, 1010, 2060, 9181, 2024, 2716, 2046, 2377, 2004, 2043, 3742, 4817, 1005, 1045, 1010, 1523, 1996, 14077, 1010, 1524, 2003, 4161, 2000, 2022, 1037, 2317, 4382, 2138, 2002, 25308, 2015, 2317, 8416, 1025, 2030, 8670, 1005, 22091, 17168, 2072, 1010, 1523, 1996, 2000, 6692, 2890, 2290, 1010, 1524, 2003, 2170, 2317, 2138, 1996, 2000, 6692, 2890, 2290, 2024, 1037, 2422, 1011, 19937, 2111, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2036, 2056, 2008, 1037, 4382, 2089, 2022, 2317, 2005, 1996, 2158, 2040, 7425, 2015, 2032, 1010, 2096, 2002, 2003, 2304, 2005, 3071, 2842, 1012, 5579, 1010, 2174, 1010, 2003, 2025, 1037, 2350, 9584, 1010, 1998, 2045, 8821, 2003, 2070, 4797, 4953, 1996, 4696, 2000, 2029, 2116, 1997, 1996, 8633, 2323, 2022, 4137, 1012, 1019, 1996, 2407, 1997, 8633, 2046, 2317, 1998, 9587, 25016, 2213, 2006, 1996, 2028, 2192, 1010, 1998, 2304, 1998, 14318, 2006, 1996, 2060, 1010, 2003, 1997, 12619, 2319, 4761, 1012, 1996, 2556, 6724, 1999, 1996, 5579, 1997, 1996, 8633, 2003, 2947, 4321, 2349, 2000, 1996, 2755, 2008, 2122, 7236, 2031, 2042, 3565, 5714, 19155, 2006, 1037, 3128, 2407, 1997, 1996, 8633, 2046, 2216, 1997, 2237, 1998, 5747, 1012, 2009, 2003, 5224, 2008, 2069, 1996, 2304, 8633, 3426, 7355, 2096, 1996, 2317, 2024, 19741, 1010, 2021, 3553, 4812, 2574, 26056, 2015, 2008, 2151, 8633, 2064, 2022, 3287, 6767, 16136, 2004, 2092, 2004, 2204, 1012, 1999, 2236, 1010, 2174, 1010, 1996, 2087, 16007, 27881, 7870, 2024, 2218, 2000, 2022, 3303, 2011, 2304, 8633, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9470514059066772, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "TABLE I.

Allusion has already been made to the Dahomean doctrine that the spirits, vod\u0173, sent disease into the world. 59 See p. 54 above. The manner in which a vod\u0173 punishes someone who has incurred his wrath is by inflicting him with disease. However, the number of cases in which specific deities cause specific diseases, as is the case among the Hausa, is small. The connection of a given spirit with a particular disease appears similarly limited among the Yoruba. Shakpanna, the analogue of Sagbata in Dahomey, here also causes smallpox, but this appears to be the only case. 60 Farrow, 1926, p. 56. Among the Jukun, the spirits cause epidemic diseases, deaths from sunstroke, epileptic fits and fevers, and a certain amount of specialization is exercised by the spirits who bring on various illnesses. Ophthalmia is caused by Ayo, rheumatism and arthritis by Agbadu, and abdominal trouble by Akura. 61 Meek, 1931, p. 310. The concept that specific spirits cause definite diseases is thus seen to be widely spread in non-Mohammedan cultures of West Africa.

Rituals of affliction are performed on a non-automatic basis and are prompted by the diagnosis of a spiritually caused illness. During such rituals the formerly ill administer to the currently ill, and so it is that religious status in the bori cult is achieved through affliction. Thus, as Turner observes, affliction has a double meaning: it is both a punishment for some kind of neglect or transgression-for bori spirits do not possess a victim without provocation-and it is evidence of a spirit\u2019s selection of his victim as a cult member (1967: 10). But initiation also marks the transition from one social status to another, from outsider to insider, at least as far as cult membership is concerned. Most social transitions fall under the heading of life-crisis rituals (birth/naming, marriage, death) and are concerned with ascribed statuses, but the bori initiation is a ritual applied to an achieved status.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2004, 2001, 3855, 2682, 17890, 2046, 1996, 8945, 3089, 8754, 2003, 4719, 2083, 1996, 2832, 1997, 1037, 8887, 1997, 21358, 29301, 3258, 1012, 13549, 1997, 21358, 29301, 3258, 2024, 2864, 2006, 1037, 2512, 1011, 6882, 3978, 1998, 2024, 9469, 2011, 1996, 11616, 1997, 1037, 6259, 2135, 3303, 7355, 1012, 2076, 2107, 13549, 1996, 3839, 5665, 21497, 2000, 1996, 2747, 5665, 1010, 1998, 2061, 2009, 2003, 2008, 3412, 3570, 1999, 1996, 8945, 3089, 8754, 2003, 4719, 2083, 21358, 29301, 3258, 1012, 2947, 1010, 2004, 6769, 24451, 1010, 21358, 29301, 3258, 2038, 1037, 3313, 3574, 1024, 2009, 2003, 2119, 1037, 7750, 2005, 2070, 2785, 1997, 19046, 2030, 9099, 17603, 28231, 1011, 2005, 8945, 3089, 8633, 2079, 2025, 10295, 1037, 6778, 2302, 4013, 19152, 1011, 1998, 2009, 2003, 3350, 1997, 1037, 4382, 1521, 1055, 4989, 1997, 2010, 6778, 2004, 1037, 8754, 2266, 1006, 3476, 1024, 2184, 1007, 1012, 2021, 17890, 2036, 6017, 1996, 6653, 2013, 2028, 2591, 3570, 2000, 2178, 1010, 2013, 21002, 2000, 25297, 1010, 2012, 2560, 2004, 2521, 2004, 8754, 5779, 2003, 4986, 1012, 2087, 2591, 22166, 2991, 2104, 1996, 5825, 1997, 2166, 1011, 5325, 13549, 1006, 4182, 1013, 10324, 1010, 3510, 1010, 2331, 1007, 1998, 2024, 4986, 2007, 28025, 3570, 2229, 1010, 2021, 1996, 8945, 3089, 17890, 2003, 1037, 8887, 4162, 2000, 2019, 4719, 3570, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.7822340726852417, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "From birth to walking the Hausa infant appears to be regarded not so much as an immature member of society, but rather as the material from which, with the proper treatment, a member of society may ultimately be produced, and the adult\u2019s function is not so much to care for the personal needs of the baby, as to do to the baby those things which will ensure its entering society in proper condition. First, then, the baby must be prepared ritually. Morning and evening ritual washing will continue for forty days, three days after birth the tribal marks are incised and the uvula removed, and seven days after birth, when the child is given its name, a Malam intercedes with Allah and asks him to protect it, while the maternal and paternal lineages express their goodwill towards it. Beyond this the parents will usually provide a number of charms to be worn round the baby\u2019s neck or loins, but the number and kind is not rigidly prescribed. Next, the baby must be prepared physically, that is, it must be given enough food to ensure its growth, it must be given appropriate treatment if it is ill, and it must be protected from physical harm. After the first few weeks it will also receive its first training leading to sphincter control by being held in the proper position for defaecation. There is no attempt at super-ego formation during this period, there is no aura of \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d either explicit or implied, and the emphasis is on the skill of the adult in so arranging things that only the desired results are obtained. A crying baby is a grave reflection on the mother, and the slightest whimper results in the baby being offered the breast, often in fact having the breast thrust upon it so that it is forcibly fed and promptly brings it all up again as soon as its mouth is free. So that, though in the main it is true that the baby gets what he wants by crying for it, he also receives badness from the mother even in conditions where the ideas of punishment and training are absent.

In the village, I was consistently able to elicit a list of more than 40 b\u00f2orii from informants. Every A\u2019rna villager claims to have inherited a relationship with two to as many as five b\u00f2orii . This inheritance pattern is predominantly patrilineal, although many said that they had inherited at least one b\u00f2orii relationship from their mothers\u2019 agnates. One finds two varieties of local b\u00f2orii: the m\u00f9ug\u00f9nta and the m\u00e0as\u00f9u daa\u2019dii, both of whom require annual animal sacrifices from those people who claim a connection to them. In Tud\u00f9 the household heads ideally provide the sacrificial animals for all agnates born in the gida . These animals are taken to the clan member whose clan role is to slay the animal, drain its blood onto the ground for the b\u00f2orii to drink, and to give the carcass back to its bearer, who in turn roasts and distributes the meat for consumption within his gida .

In due time the demon comes, and then the manangs themselves enter the darkened room. Presently sounds of scuffling, of clashing of weapons, and of shouting are heard by the Dyaks outside. Soon after the door is thrown open, and the demon said to be dead. He was cheated into coming to torment his prey, and instead of a week and helpless victim he met the crafty and mighty manangs, who have done what ordinary mortals cannot do--attacked and killed him. As a proof of the reality of the deed lights are brought in, and the manangs point to spots of blood on the floor, and occasionally to the corpse itself in the shape of a dead monkey or snake, which they say was the form the spirit took for the occasion. The trick is a very simple one. Some time in the day the manangs procure blood from a fowl or some other animal, or it may be from their own bodies, mix it with water in a bamboo to prevent congealing, smuggle it into the room, and scatter it on the floor in the dark. This can safely be done, as no one but the manangs themselves are in the room. Neither lights nor outsiders are admitted, on the plea that under such circumstances the demon could not be enticed to enter. The trick has often been detected and the performers openly accused of imposture; consequently, it is not now practised so often as in former times. When this victory over the spirit is won, the Pelian goes on in the usual way till the morning hours.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1999, 2804, 2000, 2122, 2442, 2022, 3855, 1996, 14163, 3630, 2232, 14405, 2226, 1010, 2030, 2022, 9739, 2696, 2361, 4965, 2226, 1006, 1523, 4288, 1996, 5698, 1010, 1524, 2030, 1523, 27285, 4965, 2226, 1524, 1007, 1012, 4965, 2226, 2003, 1996, 2171, 1997, 1996, 4763, 4382, 2040, 7545, 2116, 7870, 1998, 5320, 28616, 21539, 1999, 2308, 1012, 2043, 2045, 2003, 2070, 5866, 2030, 27885, 16643, 12556, 4295, 1010, 2030, 2043, 1037, 2450, 2038, 2018, 28616, 21539, 1010, 1996, 24951, 3070, 2015, 13520, 2008, 4965, 2226, 2003, 1996, 3426, 1997, 1996, 4390, 1010, 1998, 2442, 2022, 2730, 1012, 1037, 2312, 2193, 1997, 6965, 1011, 7435, 2024, 2170, 2362, 1010, 1998, 1996, 8658, 2003, 2864, 1999, 2023, 2126, 1024, 1996, 5776, 2003, 2579, 2041, 1997, 1996, 2282, 1010, 1998, 4201, 2006, 1996, 2691, 12297, 8943, 1010, 1998, 3139, 2007, 1037, 5658, 1012, 1999, 1996, 2282, 2003, 2872, 2019, 5378, 1997, 2833, 1010, 1998, 1996, 24951, 3070, 2015, 3328, 1999, 14385, 2039, 1998, 2091, 1996, 2878, 3091, 1997, 1996, 2160, 1010, 22417, 2037, 27523, 23436, 2015, 1010, 1998, 15085, 1996, 4763, 4382, 2000, 2272, 2000, 2010, 6778, 1010, 1998, 2036, 2000, 2112, 13808, 1997, 1996, 7680, 13876, 8918, 16360, 14083, 2008, 2003, 4810, 2005, 2032, 1012, 2023, 14133, 2070, 2051, 1010, 2005, 1996, 4382, 2089, 2022, 2521, 2185, 1010, 2006, 1037, 4990, 1010, 2030, 5645, 1010, 2030, 5933, 1012, 2035, 4597, 2024, 27705, 1010, 1998, 1999, 1996, 4768, 1996, 24951, 3070, 2015, 3328, 2039, 1998, 2091, 1996, 2270, 2534, 1997, 1996, 1040, 3148, 2243, 2160, 1012, 2012, 14025, 2028, 1997, 2068, 21392, 4523, 1999, 2012, 1996, 2341, 2000, 2156, 2065, 1996, 4382, 2038, 3369, 1012, 1999, 2349, 2051, 1996, 5698, 3310, 1010, 1998, 2059, 1996, 24951, 3070, 2015, 3209, 4607, 1996, 13755, 2282, 1012, 12825, 4165, 1997, 8040, 16093, 10258, 2075, 1010, 1997, 13249, 2075, 1997, 4255, 1010, 1998, 1997, 11273, 2024, 2657, 2011, 1996, 1040, 3148, 5705, 2648, 1012, 2574, 2044, 1996, 2341, 2003, 6908, 2330, 1010, 1998, 1996, 5698, 2056, 2000, 2022, 2757, 1012, 2002, 2001, 22673, 2046, 2746, 2000, 21741, 2010, 8336, 1010, 1998, 2612, 1997, 1037, 2733, 1998, 13346, 6778, 2002, 2777, 1996, 7477, 2100, 1998, 10478, 24951, 3070, 2015, 1010, 2040, 2031, 2589, 2054, 6623, 23844, 3685, 2079, 1011, 1011, 4457, 1998, 2730, 2032, 1012, 2004, 1037, 6947, 1997, 1996, 4507, 1997, 1996, 15046, 4597, 2024, 2716, 1999, 1010, 1998, 1996, 24951, 3070, 2015, 2391, 2000, 7516, 1997, 2668, 2006, 1996, 2723, 1010, 1998, 5681, 2000, 1996, 11547, 2993, 1999, 1996, 4338, 1997, 1037, 2757, 10608, 2030, 7488, 1010, 2029, 2027, 2360, 2001, 1996, 2433, 1996, 4382, 2165, 2005, 1996, 6686, 1012, 1996, 7577, 2003, 1037, 2200, 3722, 2028, 1012, 2070, 2051, 1999, 1996, 2154, 1996, 24951, 3070, 2015, 4013, 23887, 2668, 2013, 1037, 1042, 5004, 2140, 2030, 2070, 2060, 4111, 1010, 2030, 2009, 2089, 2022, 2013, 2037, 2219, 4230, 1010, 4666, 2009, 2007, 2300, 1999, 1037, 15216, 2000, 4652, 26478, 15879, 2075, 1010, 20673, 9354, 2009, 2046, 1996, 2282, 1010, 1998, 8040, 20097, 2009, 2006, 1996, 2723, 1999, 1996, 2601, 1012, 2023, 2064, 9689, 2022, 2589, 1010, 2004, 102]}, {"score": 0.9687971472740173, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Though the manang is supposed to be able to defeat the evil spirits which cause disease, there are some diseases which are too terrible for even his mystical powers.

This semengat , during life, inhabits the body, though it does have the power of wandering abroad; and dream experiences, say the Iban, are evidence of this But in addition to the semengat , there is another entity called the ayu, which is a kind of secondary soul or soul-substitute. Everyone has both a semengat and an ayu as an old manang , or shaman, put it: \u2018Our semengat and ayu share the same breath\u2019 (\u2018Semengat enggau ayu kitai saum seput\u2019) . But the ayu does not reside in the body. It takes the form of a kind of plant - it is usually likened to the bamboo (buloh) in appearance - and it is believed to grow on a far off mountain. On the slopes of this vast mountain grow the myriad ayu of all the Iban people, and there they are tended by an aged and beneficient supernatural being named Manang Betuah. The ayu of each bilek-family are conceived as of growing in a separate and compact clump, and when a child is born a new shoot appears at the base of the clump, just as it does with the bamboo plant itself. The health of the various members of the family - so it is believed - is controlled in a kind of magical symbiosis by the state of growth of their various ayu . If, for example, the ayu should become overgrown with creepers, the individual whose soul-substitute it is, will become ill; and shamans (manang) are frequently commissioned to visit the ayu of sick persons to free them from encumbrances, and generally to tend them. It is the soul of the shaman that carries out this task, while the shaman himself is in a state of trance.

Unlike Sutlive's view of the physician who heals himself, Freeman describes the manang as a \u2018healer of the spiritually afflicted\u2019 and sees the practice of shamanism as oriented to the needs of the clients (1975:283). He notes the Iban belief that all humans have separable souls ( semengat ), which may wander abroad and become ensnared by a malevolent spirit. Should this happen \u2018the owner will become ill and it is with the recovery of souls and the returning of them to their rightful owners that Iban shamans ( manang ) are principally concerned\u2019 (Freeman 1979:235). In the article \u2018Shaman and incubus\u2019, Freeman briefly describes the diagnosis and ritual typically performed by a manang in order to discern the state and whereabouts of the missing soul and to effect its return (1967:316). He then recounts and analyses an instance of a quite different manang performance, in which the shaman slays an incubus spirit. This spirit ( antu buyu ) is thought to seduce Iban women and later to claim the soul of the women's offspring, resulting in miscarriage or the death of a child (1967:317-318). Freeman describes Manang Bungai, the shaman concerned in this instance, as \u2018a strongly masculine figure\u2019 in both bearing and personality (1967:320). From the time of his arrival in the longhouse to perform the ritual, he was \u2018the imperturbable master of the scene\u2019 (1967:325). Manang Bungai specialized in the slaying of incubi, a formidable task which few shaman were prepared to tackle (1967:319-320). This suggests that the manang role may be interpreted by individual shaman in terms of their own personality and disposition. So Nyala, an aggressively masculine longhouse-headman and renowned head-hunter, confided to Freeman that, if in a dream he were ordered to become a shaman, he would, like Bungai, specialize in the slaying of incubi. \u2018But then\u2019, observes Freeman, referring to head-hunting and shamanism, \u2018the two pastimes have much in common\u2019 (1967:340).", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1999, 5688, 2000, 4572, 1005, 1055, 2892, 1011, 3451, 2817, 1010, 11462, 1005, 1055, 2219, 2147, 9144, 2007, 21307, 2319, 23610, 2964, 1999, 2049, 17522, 1011, 3451, 6123, 1012, 4406, 10514, 19646, 3512, 1005, 1055, 3193, 1997, 1996, 7522, 2040, 11005, 2015, 2370, 1010, 11462, 5577, 1996, 24951, 3070, 2004, 1037, 1520, 19783, 1997, 1996, 6259, 2135, 21358, 29301, 2098, 1521, 1998, 5927, 1996, 3218, 1997, 23610, 2964, 2004, 8048, 2000, 1996, 3791, 1997, 1996, 7846, 1006, 3339, 1024, 25504, 1007, 1012, 2002, 3964, 1996, 21307, 2319, 6772, 2008, 2035, 4286, 2031, 19802, 25236, 9293, 1006, 7367, 3549, 20697, 1007, 1010, 2029, 2089, 17677, 6917, 1998, 2468, 4372, 2015, 26148, 2094, 2011, 1037, 3287, 6767, 16136, 4382, 1012, 2323, 2023, 4148, 1520, 1996, 3954, 2097, 2468, 5665, 1998, 2009, 2003, 2007, 1996, 7233, 1997, 9293, 1998, 1996, 4192, 1997, 2068, 2000, 2037, 27167, 5608, 2008, 21307, 2319, 23610, 2015, 1006, 24951, 3070, 1007, 2024, 16552, 4986, 1521, 1006, 11462, 3245, 1024, 17825, 1007, 1012, 1999, 1996, 3720, 1520, 23610, 1998, 4297, 12083, 2271, 1521, 1010, 11462, 4780, 5577, 1996, 11616, 1998, 8887, 4050, 2864, 2011, 1037, 24951, 3070, 1999, 2344, 2000, 5860, 11795, 1996, 2110, 1998, 18913, 1997, 1996, 4394, 3969, 1998, 2000, 3466, 2049, 2709, 1006, 3476, 1024, 23980, 1007, 1012, 2002, 2059, 23412, 1998, 16478, 2019, 6013, 1997, 1037, 3243, 2367, 24951, 3070, 2836, 1010, 1999, 2029, 1996, 23610, 22889, 22916, 2019, 4297, 12083, 2271, 4382, 1012, 2023, 4382, 1006, 14405, 2226, 4965, 2226, 1007, 2003, 2245, 2000, 23199, 21307, 2319, 2308, 1998, 2101, 2000, 4366, 1996, 3969, 1997, 1996, 2308, 1005, 1055, 13195, 1010, 4525, 1999, 28616, 21539, 2030, 1996, 2331, 1997, 1037, 2775, 1006, 3476, 1024, 26628, 1011, 27003, 1007, 1012, 11462, 5577, 24951, 3070, 21122, 23805, 1010, 1996, 23610, 4986, 1999, 2023, 6013, 1010, 2004, 1520, 1037, 6118, 14818, 3275, 1521, 1999, 2119, 7682, 1998, 6180, 1006, 3476, 1024, 13710, 1007, 1012, 2013, 1996, 2051, 1997, 2010, 5508, 1999, 1996, 2146, 4580, 2000, 4685, 1996, 8887, 1010, 2002, 2001, 1520, 1996, 17727, 8743, 3126, 3676, 3468, 3040, 1997, 1996, 3496, 1521, 1006, 3476, 1024, 19652, 1007, 1012, 24951, 3070, 21122, 23805, 7772, 1999, 1996, 22889, 4710, 2075, 1997, 4297, 12083, 2072, 1010, 1037, 18085, 4708, 2029, 2261, 23610, 2020, 4810, 2000, 11147, 1006, 3476, 1024, 26499, 1011, 13710, 1007, 1012, 2023, 6083, 2008, 1996, 24951, 3070, 2535, 2089, 2022, 10009, 2011, 3265, 23610, 1999, 3408, 1997, 2037, 2219, 6180, 1998, 22137, 1012, 2061, 6396, 7911, 1010, 2019, 24663, 14818, 2146, 4580, 1011, 2132, 2386, 1998, 8228, 2132, 1011, 4477, 1010, 9530, 20740, 2094, 2000, 11462, 2008, 1010, 2065, 1999, 1037, 3959, 2002, 2020, 3641, 2000, 2468, 1037, 23610, 1010, 2002, 2052, 1010, 2066, 21122, 23805, 1010, 2569, 4697, 1999, 1996, 22889, 4710, 2075, 1997, 4297, 12083, 2072, 1012, 1520, 2021, 2059, 1521, 1010, 24451, 11462, 1010, 7727, 2000, 2132, 1011, 5933, 1998, 23610, 2964, 1010, 1520, 1996, 2048, 2627, 14428, 2015, 2031, 2172, 1999, 2691, 1521, 1006, 3476, 1024, 16029, 1007, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.56929612159729, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "A chant intoned by a manang , during a pelian bejereki (rite of spiritually fencing an expectant mother) echoes this theme of reciprocity as the manang 's spirit familiars set out to join the pelian saying:", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1037, 16883, 2046, 7228, 2011, 1037, 24951, 3070, 1010, 2076, 1037, 21877, 15204, 2022, 20009, 26576, 1006, 14034, 1997, 6259, 2135, 15962, 2019, 5987, 4630, 2388, 1007, 17659, 2023, 4323, 1997, 28667, 11514, 21735, 2004, 1996, 24951, 3070, 1005, 1055, 4382, 5220, 2015, 2275, 2041, 2000, 3693, 1996, 21877, 15204, 3038, 1024, 102]}, {"score": 0.6993803977966309, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "Kitai lalu mai penchelap ubat kembuan batu gemisan tangkai rajang .

Each \u2018planting\u2019 forges a beneficial link between the human and celestial realms. The manang is depicted as replicating the past actions of now celestial manang for the benefit of his patient in the terrestrial world; in so doing, he creates a direct link between the unborn child and the benevolent supernatural beings ( petara ); and, simultaneously, he establishes a visible material counterpart of the child's vital principle ( semengat ). Furthermore, he forges these connections at the same time as he erects an \u2018unseen spiritual fence\u2019 around the mother and unborn child to thwart malign activity on the part of any less benevolent spirits in the immediate environment. The cordyline remains, after the ritual performance, as a condensed symbol: a representation of the unborn child's vitality and longevity and a channel of power bearing all the authority of the manang tradition. This polysemic character also adheres to the rite itself: described, even named, as a \u2018fencing\u2019 and \u2018enclosing\u2019, it is simultaneously and just as clearly, a \u2018bridging\u2019 and \u2018embedding\u2019. This chant, indeed this whole ritual, is an excellent example of the Iban use of botanic metaphors and symbols to represent aspects of the person. Not only do the celestial manang assist in the series of plantings, which culminate in establishing the unborn child's cordyline of longevity, but they are themselves depicted in the pervasive botanic idiom. 13 Sather has described \u2018plant symbolism\u2019 as \u2018a fundamental element of Iban thought\u2019 (1978b:98). He points out that: Many plants are attributed sacred properties, or function as ritual objects, and floral imagery, symbolizing spiritual powers and relationships, or demarcating realms of gods and spirits, permeates every facet of Iban ritual life (cf. Harrisson and Sandin 1966:56-62). Like men and animals, plants are regarded as a major kind of living thing, sharing the same fundamental properties of life ( idup ) and death ( mati or parai ). In this connection, plants are the basic symbol of life itself to the Iban. The fecundity and flourishing, generative growth of plants is, at an individual level, the prime symbol of human fertility and healthful vigour. Similarly the vulnerability of plants, and their eventual death, provide the basic analogy for impaired human health and mortality ... These analogies refer to both rituals and the ordinary metaphors of everyday speech (1978b:98).

Mythical shaman are thought to tend the bungai and a manang can examine it through his quartz crystal. Uchibori's manang informants interpreted the bungai variously as a metaphor expressed in the context of ritual language or as a cluster of the semengat of members of the bilek -family.

The term pansa utai (something passed by) refers to a spirit encounter of which the Iban concerned may not even be consciously aware (Jensen 1974:147). Nevertheless, they might have been \u2018struck by a spirit sword\u2019 or \u2018wounded by an arrow from the spirits blowpipe\u2019 (Nyuak 1906:168). Or the spirit might have deposited a physical token -- a piece of bone, wood, cloth, hair -- in the person's body (Jensen 1974:147). Using the quartz crystal \u2018seeing stone\u2019 ( batu ilau ) and stroking the patient's body with objects from the medicine box, a manang is thought to locate and then remove any troublesome foreign matter. Jensen reports that the manang first bites the blade of a knife for strength (1974:147). In a case Brooke Low describes, the manang called on a spirit familiar to divine the fate of the patient and reveal the location of the intrusive object (Ling Roth 1896:I,267-268). If a spirit itself is causing the problem, the manang may propitiate it with sacrifices, entice it into a wooden figure, try to will it away, bark and growl at it or otherwise frighten it away, and in some cases even attempt to kill it (Brooke Low in Ling Roth 1896:I,266; Jensen 1974:148; Richards 1981:262-263). Just as these forms of attack are directed against spirits who interfere with the physical person ( tuboh ), so they are used to overcome spirits who ensnare a wandering soul ( semengat ). In the latter case, the confrontation occurs among the spirits, as part of the manang 's efforts to retrieve the soul.

It evinces the three phases by which van Gennep characterized rites of passage: separation, margin, and aggregation (1960). The candidate steps out of society, enters a liminal state, and finally emerges to a new and different social status. The universal theme of death and rebirth articulates this structural transition. At the same time, the symbols, which mark the liminal state, express the particular transition from Iban to manang . I have commented earlier on the frequent use of certain kinds of textiles in Iban ritual. In the myth of Manang Landu, a woven blanket serves as wings to enable Landu \u2018to fly into the sky\u2019 (Sandin 1983:238) and during his initiation as a manang , Ina Inda places \u2018fish-hooks\u2019 into his shoulders \u2018to prevent the woven blanket he would wear when officiating pelian ceremonies from falling to the floor\u2019 (1983:239). A large hanging or blanket ( pua ) is used to cover a manang who falls to the floor in a state of \u2018trance\u2019 ( luput ) (Jensen 1974:149). It may also be used to wrap the body of the dead for the journey to the cemetery (Vogelsanger 1980:119).

In some bedinding rites, as discussed earlier, the pua cloth is the barrier material -- magically turned into walls of stone -- intended to keep the incubus at bay.

Furthermore, as Freeman points out, \u2018the Iban world view recognizes no firm boundary between phantasy and reality, between the imagined realm in which demons roam and the natural world of everyday experience\u2019 (1967:317). It is in the context of this shared domain that the Iban seek to establish, by ritual means, barriers of limited provenance and application so as to separate or conceal particular elements of this multi-faceted environment, as and when they deem it necessary to do so. In this way, precautions may be taken against threatening antu , as well as against hazardous exposure to the dead. I have already discussed the shielding rites ( bedinding , literally, to make a protective wall) in which a shaman uses textiles to enclose an Iban woman threatened by an incubus, or applies a talisman ( engkerabun ) to make an Iban invisible to evil spirits and so cure him/her of bad dreams. Similarly, Heppell reports that after an ordeal by diving \u2018all the supporters of the winning principal receive a payment ( lantan ) which is made to create a barrier across which any curses made by the loser cannot pass\u2019 (1975:332 ch.9 n.1). The payment is thought to strengthen the souls of the victor's supporters, making them immune from the consequences of the loser's curse. Again, men leaving a graveyard after a burial perform acts intended as \u2018the putting of a barrier between the world of the living and the Land of the Dead. For the border between the two realms has been dangerously opened by the digging of the grave\u2019 (Uchibori 1978:68). Finally, when the troop of the dead come to collect the newly deceased, they find themselves unable to enter the longhouse, since \u2018the entrance is blocked by a mythical shaman with ceremonial fabrics which have fearful designs of crocodiles and tigers\u2019 (Uchibori 1978:184). When no such measures are taken, the border between the world of the living and that of the dead is said to be \u2018[n]o thicker than the skin of the brinjil fruit\u2019 (Freeman 1970:39) and as penetrable as \u2018the inner skin of a lemayong fruit\u2019 (Uchibori 1978:219). Likewise, a ritual chant describes the door of the sky as \u2018thinner than the skin of a banana plant\u2019 and \u2018thinner than the skin of the fruit of an eggplant\u2019 (Masing 1981:243). Nevertheless, this same door of the sky is simultaneously depicted, in the chant, as \u2018a formidable door\u2019 which only Lang Singalang Burong is powerful enough to break through (1981:243).

It is forbidden amongst the Dyaks to cut it unless they first take a hatchet which they carefully wrap round with cotton; they then strike as hard as they can, leave the axe in and call upon the antu , either to leave the tree or to give them the sign that he does not wish it cut down; then they go home. Next day they visit the tree, and if they find the axe lying on the ground they know it is inhabited and do not attempt to cut it down; if the axe still remain in, they can, without danger, cut the tree down. I consider it is no antu , but strychnine which exists in the sap to a large percentage. Now, so long as the sap is running, no axe would long remain in, but must necessarily be cast out by the action of heat and the expansion of the gutta exuding. If the axe remain in, it proves only that the tree is not lively but ready to die.

He acts upon its suggestions and propitiates it with sacrifices; but if it still prove obstinate and refuse to budge, the manang admits his inability to deal with it, and some other wizard is called in who is believed to have at his command a more powerful familiar. Whether the patient live or die the manang is rewarded for his pains; he makes sure of that before he undertakes the case, for he is put to considerable inconvenience, being fetched away from his own home and obliged to take up his abode with his patient; he can therefore undertake only one case at a time, but to it he devotes his whole attention. He takes his meals with the family, and in other ways makes himself quite at home. If a cure be effected he receives a valuable present in addition to his ordinary expenses. Herbal remedies are frequently administered by him, and a diet enjoined. Such treatment works wonders in all simple disorders, and not unnaturally, but to enhance the value of the cure, spells are muttered and cabalistic verses recited exorcising the foul fiend that is tormenting the body. I have known manangs to have administered in this way European medicines procured from the Government dispensary, for they are wide awake and ready at all times to avail themselves of remedies of known efficacy. Every regular manang is supposed to be attended by a familiar spirit who is good and powerful; but it often happens that the evil spirit is the more powerful of the two, and when this is the case the sick man cannot recover, and death ensues. By death they understand the flight, of the soul out of the body. When a person complains of pain in the body the familiar will often suggest that some mischievous devil has put something into him to cause the pain. The manang will thereupon manipulate the part and pretend by some sleight of hand to draw something out of it, a stick, or a stone, or whatever it may chance to be, which, no doubt, he has previously concealed about his person, and he will hand it about and exhibit it as the cause of the pain in the body, which he has thus been able to remove without so much as leaving a mark on the skin.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 24951, 3070, 3504, 2588, 1037, 5305, 2711, 2004, 2108, 8679, 2007, 2019, 4763, 4382, 1010, 1998, 2004, 2146, 2004, 2023, 4763, 4382, 3464, 1999, 6664, 1996, 5776, 3685, 12452, 2010, 2740, 1010, 2002, 9530, 25243, 2015, 2009, 2000, 18280, 1025, 2065, 2009, 2022, 27885, 16643, 12556, 1998, 2097, 2025, 2175, 2002, 24814, 2010, 2219, 5220, 4382, 1010, 1998, 11186, 2009, 2000, 2265, 2032, 1999, 2054, 2126, 1996, 21741, 2953, 2089, 2022, 19914, 2588, 2000, 2202, 2049, 6712, 1012, 2002, 4490, 2588, 2049, 15690, 1998, 17678, 29050, 4570, 2009, 2007, 18502, 1025, 2021, 2065, 2009, 2145, 6011, 27885, 16643, 12556, 1998, 10214, 2000, 24981, 1010, 1996, 24951, 3070, 14456, 2010, 13720, 2000, 3066, 2007, 2009, 1010, 1998, 2070, 2060, 10276, 2003, 2170, 1999, 2040, 2003, 3373, 2000, 2031, 2012, 2010, 3094, 1037, 2062, 3928, 5220, 1012, 3251, 1996, 5776, 2444, 2030, 3280, 1996, 24951, 3070, 2003, 14610, 2005, 2010, 20398, 1025, 2002, 3084, 2469, 1997, 2008, 2077, 2002, 16617, 2015, 1996, 2553, 1010, 2005, 2002, 2003, 2404, 2000, 6196, 4297, 2239, 8159, 13684, 1010, 2108, 18584, 2098, 2185, 2013, 2010, 2219, 2188, 1998, 14723, 2000, 2202, 2039, 2010, 11113, 10244, 2007, 2010, 5776, 1025, 2002, 2064, 3568, 16617, 2069, 2028, 2553, 2012, 1037, 2051, 1010, 2021, 2000, 2009, 2002, 23313, 2015, 2010, 2878, 3086, 1012, 2002, 3138, 2010, 12278, 2007, 1996, 2155, 1010, 1998, 1999, 2060, 3971, 3084, 2370, 3243, 2012, 2188, 1012, 2065, 1037, 9526, 2022, 3466, 2098, 2002, 8267, 1037, 7070, 2556, 1999, 2804, 2000, 2010, 6623, 11727, 1012, 27849, 2128, 7583, 3111, 2024, 4703, 8564, 2011, 2032, 1010, 1998, 1037, 8738, 4372, 5558, 21280, 1012, 2107, 3949, 2573, 16278, 1999, 2035, 3722, 10840, 1010, 1998, 2025, 21242, 2135, 1010, 2021, 2000, 11598, 1996, 3643, 1997, 1996, 9526, 1010, 11750, 2024, 6250, 1998, 9298, 13911, 4588, 11086, 24843, 4654, 2953, 22987, 2075, 1996, 12487, 10882, 10497, 2008, 2003, 21741, 2075, 1996, 2303, 1012, 1045, 2031, 2124, 24951, 3070, 2015, 2000, 2031, 8564, 1999, 2023, 2126, 2647, 20233, 4013, 19405, 2013, 1996, 2231, 4487, 13102, 6132, 5649, 1010, 2005, 2027, 2024, 2898, 8300, 1998, 3201, 2012, 2035, 2335, 2000, 24608, 3209, 1997, 2128, 7583, 3111, 1997, 2124, 21150, 1012, 2296, 3180, 24951, 3070, 2003, 4011, 2000, 2022, 3230, 2011, 1037, 5220, 4382, 2040, 2003, 2204, 1998, 3928, 1025, 2021, 2009, 2411, 6433, 2008, 1996, 4763, 4382, 2003, 1996, 2062, 3928, 1997, 1996, 2048, 1010, 1998, 2043, 2023, 2003, 1996, 2553, 1996, 5305, 2158, 3685, 8980, 1010, 1998, 2331, 4372, 6342, 2229, 1012, 2011, 2331, 2027, 3305, 1996, 3462, 1010, 1997, 1996, 3969, 2041, 1997, 1996, 2303, 1012, 2043, 1037, 2711, 17612, 2015, 1997, 3255, 1999, 1996, 2303, 1996, 5220, 2097, 2411, 6592, 2008, 2070, 25723, 6548, 2038, 2404, 2242, 2046, 2032, 2000, 3426, 1996, 3255, 1012, 1996, 24951, 3070, 2097, 2045, 6279, 2239, 17708, 1996, 2112, 1998, 9811, 2011, 2070, 22889, 7416, 13900, 1997, 2192, 2000, 4009, 2242, 2041, 1997, 2009, 1010, 1037, 6293, 1010, 2030, 1037, 2962, 1010, 2030, 3649, 2009, 2089, 3382, 2000, 2022, 1010, 2029, 1010, 2053, 4797, 1010, 2002, 2038, 3130, 14091, 2055, 2010, 2711, 102]}, {"score": 0.94729083776474, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "The Dyaks believe that every individual has seven souls ( samangat ), and that when a person is sick, one or more of these are in captivity, and must be reclaimed to effect a cure.

The doors are of heavy timbers, swinging on iron hinges, and, lacking a metal lock, are bolted at night with a heavy wooden bar which is kept in place by a second plece above it on a pivot. The outer doorway may have a fuel lamp for night and in many cases is furnished with oharms designed to ward off the evil eye, a belief which will be discussed in a later section. These are oharacteristically a blue porcelain plate, embedded in the mud wall-surfacing, or a pair of old shoes hung on a nail. The popular reasoning behind the second device is that it indicates to a person with the eye that \u201cyour malevolent glance is as powerful as our pair of old shoes,\u201d an explanation that probably has little to do with the origin of the custom. Whenever the construction of a house is completed, the new owner sacrifices an animal, a sheep or a goat, by cutting its throat before the door and smears some of the blood on the doorposts and the threshhold. Often he dips his hand in the blood, and applies it to the door, making by its imprint the so-called \u201cHand of Fatima\u201d (referred, almost certainly ex post facto , to the daughter of the Prophet), a symbol found in almost all parts of the Middle East, particularly in amulet jewelry. The same sacrifice is applied to new additions to the house, and, in case a new storey has been built, the throat of the animal is slit over a window sill. It will be seen that When a bride enters her new home, an animal is similarly slaughtered before the threshhold and the maiden's sandal is dipped in its blood. It is an incredible breach of etiquette, if not criminal, to enter a house without announcing oneself, a usage which is supposed to have an origin in the life of the Prophet, and custom demands that the visitor knock and wait outside until ushered in.

Infants, both male and female, are clad in simple cloth dresses, utilized at one time for a boy and the next for a girl, and no diapers or undergarments of a specific type are in use. Girls add a pair of cotton drawers beneath the dress at about five years of age, and continue in this simple ensemble until they reach what is considered a marriageable age, usually about sixteen. At this point they begin to don the pacha or light veil whenever in public. The daughters of the wealthy may have a rich costume and jewelry in imitation of their mothers, but most have to await their wedding for these things. In a family with a number of daughters, such as that of the merchant Fatah-Ullah with six, the dresses are traded about regularly, almost from day to day, and a problem faced by parents is providing a new garment for one daughter without a storm of protests from her sisters. Little boys of the wealthy houses are also outfitted at an early age in imitation of their elders or, sometimes, as in the case of the nephew of Ra'uf Effendi (who, incidentally, always appears in Kurdish dress), have European blouses and playsuits. On the garb of this particular youngster, however to all appearances European, one must note the piece of blue porcelain pinned on the shoulder to ward off the evil eye. Most boys of the town wear white cotton trousers and shirts, similar to the undergarments of adults, and the students like to add a cloth European jacket. The dress of the children of officials and officers is much like that of their Kurdish play-fellows, at the same time more European in character, particularly for the boys who sometimes wear slacks and jackets. Almost all of the youth go barefoot a large part of the time, although sandals or shoes appear in the winter, usually without stockings. The infants and younger children are confined to the houses in extremely cold weather, and the problem for them does not exist. There is no specific time at which a youth or a maiden must put on adult attire. In the case of a girl, the parents insist on the veil whenever they feel the neighbors \u201cmight talk\u201d if it was not worn. For the boys, the adulation of weapons has already been noticed, and is coupled with a similar feeling toward the clothing of chieftains and their bodyguards, warriors full-blown in the eyes of adolescence. Hence the mother is under considerable pressure to influence the father for money to deck out his son in adult clothing. The young Kurd who follows a government career in the secondary schools and colleges of the cities soon learns to sublimate such notions to the condemning adjective baladi , \u201crustic,\u201d although he may retain a certain admiration for the dashing garb of the heroes of his youth.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 5929, 1997, 16725, 1998, 2336, 2515, 2025, 5478, 3668, 6594, 1012, 16725, 1010, 2119, 3287, 1998, 2931, 1010, 2024, 13681, 1999, 3722, 8416, 14464, 1010, 12550, 2012, 2028, 2051, 2005, 1037, 2879, 1998, 1996, 2279, 2005, 1037, 2611, 1010, 1998, 2053, 22939, 7347, 2030, 2104, 6843, 8163, 1997, 1037, 3563, 2828, 2024, 1999, 2224, 1012, 3057, 5587, 1037, 3940, 1997, 6557, 22497, 4218, 1996, 4377, 2012, 2055, 2274, 2086, 1997, 2287, 1010, 1998, 3613, 1999, 2023, 3722, 7241, 2127, 2027, 3362, 2054, 2003, 2641, 1037, 3510, 3085, 2287, 1010, 2788, 2055, 7032, 1012, 2012, 2023, 2391, 2027, 4088, 2000, 2123, 1996, 14397, 3270, 2030, 2422, 15562, 7188, 1999, 2270, 1012, 1996, 5727, 1997, 1996, 7272, 2089, 2031, 1037, 4138, 9427, 1998, 11912, 1999, 20017, 1997, 2037, 10756, 1010, 2021, 2087, 2031, 2000, 26751, 2037, 5030, 2005, 2122, 2477, 1012, 1999, 1037, 2155, 2007, 1037, 2193, 1997, 5727, 1010, 2107, 2004, 2008, 1997, 1996, 6432, 6638, 4430, 1011, 17359, 14431, 2007, 2416, 1010, 1996, 14464, 2024, 7007, 2055, 5570, 1010, 2471, 2013, 2154, 2000, 2154, 1010, 1998, 1037, 3291, 4320, 2011, 3008, 2003, 4346, 1037, 2047, 19002, 2005, 2028, 2684, 2302, 1037, 4040, 1997, 8090, 2013, 2014, 5208, 1012, 2210, 3337, 1997, 1996, 7272, 3506, 2024, 2036, 11018, 3064, 2012, 2019, 2220, 2287, 1999, 20017, 1997, 2037, 13376, 2030, 1010, 2823, 1010, 2004, 1999, 1996, 2553, 1997, 1996, 7833, 1997, 10958, 1005, 1057, 2546, 1041, 18032, 4305, 1006, 2040, 1010, 5043, 3973, 1010, 2467, 3544, 1999, 15553, 4377, 1007, 1010, 2031, 2647, 18149, 2015, 1998, 3248, 14663, 2015, 1012, 2006, 1996, 11721, 15185, 1997, 2023, 3327, 2402, 6238, 1010, 2174, 2000, 2035, 3922, 2647, 1010, 2028, 2442, 3602, 1996, 3538, 1997, 2630, 17767, 11807, 2006, 1996, 3244, 2000, 4829, 2125, 1996, 4763, 3239, 1012, 2087, 3337, 1997, 1996, 2237, 4929, 2317, 6557, 15292, 1998, 11344, 1010, 2714, 2000, 1996, 2104, 6843, 8163, 1997, 6001, 1010, 1998, 1996, 2493, 2066, 2000, 5587, 1037, 8416, 2647, 6598, 1012, 1996, 4377, 1997, 1996, 2336, 1997, 4584, 1998, 3738, 2003, 2172, 2066, 2008, 1997, 2037, 15553, 2377, 1011, 13572, 1010, 2012, 1996, 2168, 2051, 2062, 2647, 1999, 2839, 1010, 3391, 2005, 1996, 3337, 2040, 2823, 4929, 27786, 1998, 17764, 1012, 2471, 2035, 1997, 1996, 3360, 2175, 22985, 1037, 2312, 2112, 1997, 1996, 2051, 1010, 2348, 24617, 2030, 6007, 3711, 1999, 1996, 3467, 1010, 2788, 2302, 26412, 1012, 1996, 16725, 1998, 3920, 2336, 2024, 12302, 2000, 1996, 3506, 1999, 5186, 3147, 4633, 1010, 1998, 1996, 3291, 2005, 2068, 2515, 2025, 4839, 1012, 2045, 2003, 2053, 3563, 2051, 2012, 2029, 1037, 3360, 2030, 1037, 10494, 2442, 2404, 2006, 4639, 20426, 1012, 1999, 1996, 2553, 1997, 1037, 2611, 1010, 1996, 3008, 18292, 2006, 1996, 15562, 7188, 2027, 2514, 1996, 10638, 1523, 2453, 2831, 1524, 2065, 2009, 2001, 2025, 6247, 1012, 2005, 1996, 3337, 1010, 1996, 4748, 9513, 1997, 4255, 2038, 2525, 2042, 4384, 1010, 1998, 2003, 11211, 2007, 1037, 2714, 3110, 2646, 1996, 5929, 1997, 26625, 2015, 1998, 2037, 25681, 1010, 6424, 2440, 1011, 10676, 1999, 1996, 2159, 1997, 29101, 1012, 6516, 1996, 2388, 2003, 2104, 6196, 102]}, {"score": 0.7435274720191956, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Because the ablutions before prayers, with some reservation, apply to Muslims of both sexes, it is equally difficult to obtain an exact idea of the bathing habits of the townswomen. Unmarried girls are supposed to wash themselves completely twice or three times each week during the summer and once or twice each fortnight in colder weather. All of the hair of a woman's body must be removed: the pubic hair with a razor, that under the arms with the fingers, and the rest with a depilatory concocted of sugar and gum arabic. In addition, the ankles and feet are rubbed with a small piece of black stone. Both men and women clean the teeth with their fingers, pieces of rag, or European toothbrushes. The hair of a woman's head, on the other hand, is almost never cut or trimmed, and its length and richness are thought to be outstanding attributes of feminine beauty. Whenever two women quarrel, one often cries out \u201cyour hair will be cut,\u201d a promise of great catastrophe for her opponent. At an early age, a girl begins to wear a number of braids, and, save when undone in the bath, this type of coiffure is retained until death. The number of braids varies, and is usually about ten. The hair is regularly stained a reddish colour with henna whose use, in addition to being purely customary, is said \u201cto fortify the scalp.\u201d In some houses, kuhl , a finely powdered sulphide of antimony moistened with water, is applied to blacken the edges of the eye. European cosmetics and perfumes appear in most of the wealthier homes, and younger women paint their lips and nails.

For menstruation clean pieces of rag are used as towels, and sexual intercourse is prohibited during the period. The cloths are commonly washed and reused. Tattooing is denied by most men to be done by women of the town, but it is possible to observe daily female residents of the lower classes with blue dots or marks inscribed on their faces.

In one there was the conventional white rag tied to a pole leaning against the wall, and in the other a tattered green banner hanging from a flagpole whose ornament was a flat metal hand, the \u201cHand of Fatima\u201d previously mentioned. Some graves had a large quantity of broken blue porcelain scattered over them, and it was said that this custom was followed if the deceased was a young man, both to indicate the grave as such and to avert further misfortune. There are indications, however, that breaking porcelain at death is a cultural trait of some antiquity, and further study might prove it an interesting index of historical connection.

The scrolls can be obtained in metal cases which are worn about the throat, sometimes as a part of the jewelry, but are more commonly stitched in cloth packets hung on a string around the neck or pinned to the shoulder. Metal disks inscribed with the name of God are also in use, as well as expensive types of pendants which exhibit complete paragraphs from the Quran. Two popular items made up into charms are imported from Iran, irregularly shaped bits of turquoise or blue porcelain and small white sea-shells. These are pierced and either strung on a thread or kept in a cloth bag. One charm is to sew two green beads in a piece of cloth, another is a piece of pumice wrapped in a cloth, and a third, called mazu , consists of two pieces of the yellow bark of a certain tree hung on a string with a yellow bead between them. A piece of cloth from the grave of a holy man may be incorporated in some packets. An interesting symbol, a wheel whose four spokes are filled with geometric designs, is painted on the walls of houses or embroidered on cloth and sewn on the garments of children. children. That a blue porcelain plate or a pair of old shoes is often installed beside the door of a house has been noticed. An iron horseshoe, as in America, may also be nailed above a door or on a wall. A human hand cut out of metal, the \u201cHand of Fatima\u201d spoken of previously, is often found in jewelry. Adults seem to require little protection against the evil eye, but younger children, particularly males, almost always have charms pinned to their garments and their cradles are hung with them. Houses and animals are similarly prosected. There is some rationalization of these charms. Those derived from the Quran have a power within them. The others, apart from their intrinsic qualities, deflect the glance of the evil eye from the object in question to themselves, a sort of magnetic property, because of their bright colour, their design, or something else.", "predicted_label": 0, "input_ids": [101, 2006, 1996, 2060, 2192, 1010, 4652, 3512, 24044, 2024, 2307, 1999, 2193, 1012, 2034, 2426, 2068, 2024, 2216, 5173, 2013, 1996, 21288, 1010, 17433, 1997, 3259, 2006, 2029, 3056, 13768, 2031, 2042, 2517, 2030, 4809, 1997, 1996, 2147, 2993, 1012, 1996, 23074, 2064, 2022, 4663, 1999, 3384, 3572, 2029, 2024, 6247, 2055, 1996, 3759, 1010, 2823, 2004, 1037, 2112, 1997, 1996, 11912, 1010, 2021, 2024, 2062, 4141, 26035, 2098, 1999, 8416, 23730, 5112, 2006, 1037, 5164, 2105, 1996, 3300, 2030, 11807, 2000, 1996, 3244, 1012, 3384, 23999, 14551, 2007, 1996, 2171, 1997, 2643, 2024, 2036, 1999, 2224, 1010, 2004, 2092, 2004, 6450, 4127, 1997, 23152, 2015, 2029, 8327, 3143, 20423, 2015, 2013, 1996, 21288, 1012, 2048, 2759, 5167, 2081, 2039, 2046, 24044, 2024, 10964, 2013, 4238, 1010, 12052, 2135, 5044, 9017, 1997, 28653, 2030, 2630, 17767, 1998, 2235, 2317, 2712, 1011, 10986, 1012, 2122, 2024, 16276, 1998, 2593, 23509, 2006, 1037, 11689, 2030, 2921, 1999, 1037, 8416, 4524, 1012, 2028, 11084, 2003, 2000, 7367, 2860, 2048, 2665, 17530, 1999, 1037, 3538, 1997, 8416, 1010, 2178, 2003, 1037, 3538, 1997, 16405, 7712, 2063, 5058, 1999, 1037, 8416, 1010, 1998, 1037, 2353, 1010, 2170, 5003, 9759, 1010, 3774, 1997, 2048, 4109, 1997, 1996, 3756, 11286, 1997, 1037, 3056, 3392, 5112, 2006, 1037, 5164, 2007, 1037, 3756, 26892, 2094, 2090, 2068, 1012, 1037, 3538, 1997, 8416, 2013, 1996, 6542, 1997, 1037, 4151, 2158, 2089, 2022, 5100, 1999, 2070, 23730, 1012, 2019, 5875, 6454, 1010, 1037, 5217, 3005, 2176, 3764, 2015, 2024, 3561, 2007, 14965, 5617, 1010, 2003, 4993, 2006, 1996, 3681, 1997, 3506, 2030, 23590, 2006, 8416, 1998, 7367, 7962, 2006, 1996, 21902, 1997, 2336, 1012, 2336, 1012, 2008, 1037, 2630, 17767, 5127, 2030, 1037, 3940, 1997, 2214, 6007, 2003, 2411, 5361, 3875, 1996, 2341, 1997, 1037, 2160, 2038, 2042, 4384, 1012, 2019, 3707, 23449, 1010, 2004, 1999, 2637, 1010, 2089, 2036, 2022, 26304, 2682, 1037, 2341, 2030, 2006, 1037, 2813, 1012, 1037, 2529, 2192, 3013, 2041, 1997, 3384, 1010, 1996, 1523, 2192, 1997, 27596, 1524, 5287, 1997, 3130, 1010, 2003, 2411, 2179, 1999, 11912, 1012, 6001, 4025, 2000, 5478, 2210, 3860, 2114, 1996, 4763, 3239, 1010, 2021, 3920, 2336, 1010, 3391, 3767, 1010, 2471, 2467, 2031, 24044, 11807, 2000, 2037, 21902, 1998, 2037, 18293, 2015, 2024, 5112, 2007, 2068, 1012, 3506, 1998, 4176, 2024, 6660, 12388, 10985, 1012, 2045, 2003, 2070, 11581, 3989, 1997, 2122, 24044, 1012, 2216, 5173, 2013, 1996, 21288, 2031, 1037, 2373, 2306, 2068, 1012, 1996, 2500, 1010, 4237, 2013, 2037, 23807, 11647, 1010, 13366, 2571, 6593, 1996, 6054, 1997, 1996, 4763, 3239, 2013, 1996, 4874, 1999, 3160, 2000, 3209, 1010, 1037, 4066, 1997, 8060, 3200, 1010, 2138, 1997, 2037, 4408, 6120, 1010, 2037, 2640, 1010, 2030, 2242, 2842, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.8544208407402039, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "Charms such as these have a variety of origins. Minature copies of the Quran, metal disks, beads, pleces of turquoise, and shells are imported by the merchants and sold in the bazar , not only to the townspeople, but to the villagers among whom they are always in great demand. Slips of paper on which appropriate Quranio verses have been written may be obtained from one of the mullas or some other literate specialist. Cloth from the tomb of a holy man is easily obtained. Most persons assemble their own combinations, stitching them in cloth bags which are worn about the neck or pinned to the garments. Many of these are not solely to ward off the evil eye, but have other purposes. The bodyguard of a chieftain might carry one which protects him from gunfire, and a great number are used to cure bodily ills. One of the mullas makes a practice of writing charms of this type. Such pieces of paper are usually soaked in water and the liquid is then imbibed. Recently a poor woman with some complaint visited the medical officer and the latter wrote her a prescription which could have been filled in Erbil. Under the impression that the medical officer, who neglected to explain the matter to her, operated like the mulla , the woman took the piece of paper to her home, mixed it with water, and drank if off. It might be mentioned that she was cured, and, the doctor said, reappeared the next day to request an identical piece of paper as insurance against the illness in the future.

When taken out on to land and into the clearing surrounding the house (the cultural world of people) they become active and alive. In myth, when the He People left the river and came on to land they changed from anaconda to human. In the same way, a baby is born in the gardens (semi-nature), taken to the river, and then brought from there into the house (the human, cultural world). In each case, the burning of beeswax creates a disjunction between one state and another, dead and living, spirit and human. When the He move from forest and river to house, from dead to living, a corresponding but reversed change occurs in the human world. The participants at He House are killed by having snuff blown up their noses. This snuff, obtained by Manioc-stick Anaconda from the Sun in the Underworld, is the Sun\u2019s fire, used to burn himself and his brother Macaw to death so that their bones became the He instruments (M.6.A). The participants also become He People. The burning of wax affects this change and also causes a disjunction between the world of women (on the side of nature) and the world of men (on the side of culture), for the screen that separates the sexes (see fig. 2) is drawn across the rear of the house at this point.

The initiates are in a liminal position between childhood and adulthood; they are both children and adults; burned wax separates these two states.

This illness, wisiose, is precisely that which afflicts the initiates who fail to keep the food and other taboos after He House; their anuses become so big that they literally drain away. The initiates are opened up; excessive openness will kill them. The consumption of yag\u00e9 is reserved for initiated men; young boys are first given yag\u00e9 at Fruit House as the first stage of initiation; at He House they are given yag\u00e9 again, this time a much stronger drink and more of it; yag\u00e9 induces violent diarrhoea and vomiting, especially in those, such as initiates, who are not used to its effects. Vomiting and diarrhoea indicate an open mouth and anus. After their first experience of Fruit House, great stress is placed on the young boys getting up early each morning to bathe and to vomit water; the theme of vomiting is particularly emphasised during the ritual bathe that takes place at the end of He House. Finally and more speculatively, the use of black paint at He House can, I think, be linked to the theme of opening up. The body of Yurupary was full of holes (M.8.22) and it was full of flowers (M.8.29); these two facts suggest that he was a container full of holes like a basket. The designs painted on the bodies of the initiates and other men at the dance that marks the end of the marginal period, like those painted for other social dances, are clearly derived from the patterns of weaving.

At the start of He House the initiates are painted from chin to toes in uniform black paint whilst the elder men are painted only as far as their knees.

In my analysis of the rites, I have placed great emphasis on the significance of beeswax, an emphasis that reflects the importance that the Barasana attach to this substance themselves. Again, whilst I know that the ritual use of beeswax is common to all the Indian groups of the Pir\u00e1-paran\u00e1 area, I cannot find any direct evidence for its use in Yurupary rites elsewhere. The Barasana burn beeswax on a number of occasions outside the context of Yurupary rites (see ch. 7) and it is significant that many other authors mention the use of \u2018smoke from burning embers\u2019, \u2018resin and embers\u2019, \u2018burning resin\u2019, \u2018fumigation\u2019, etc., in exactly these same contexts. Considering that the beeswax in question (cerumen) is made largely from resin, these references suggest that its ritual use may be more widespread than might at first be supposed. Whether or not beeswax is, or was, also used in the context of Yurupary rites I cannot say, but there is evidence from myth for the existence of something like the beeswax gourd amongst the Tukano (see ch. 7, nn. 22 and 30). Finally, it must be pointed out that the ritual use of beeswax is easily overlooked, especially during Fruit House rites, partly because it is less eye-catching than Yurupary instruments and ritual whipping, and partly because it looks and smells very like the resin that is used to light the house.", "predicted_label": 0, "input_ids": [101, 1037, 2117, 2391, 1010, 3141, 2000, 1996, 3160, 1997, 3251, 2045, 2024, 1010, 2030, 2020, 1010, 17105, 7978, 2000, 2002, 2160, 1999, 2060, 3033, 1997, 1996, 12436, 6279, 2229, 5936, 1996, 2224, 1997, 13734, 4213, 2595, 1998, 1996, 13734, 4213, 2595, 2175, 3126, 2094, 1012, 1999, 2026, 4106, 1997, 1996, 17105, 1010, 1045, 2031, 2872, 2307, 7902, 2006, 1996, 7784, 1997, 13734, 4213, 2595, 1010, 2019, 7902, 2008, 11138, 1996, 5197, 2008, 1996, 3347, 16782, 2532, 22476, 2000, 2023, 9415, 3209, 1012, 2153, 1010, 5819, 1045, 2113, 2008, 1996, 8887, 2224, 1997, 13734, 4213, 2595, 2003, 2691, 2000, 2035, 1996, 2796, 2967, 1997, 1996, 14255, 2527, 1011, 28383, 2181, 1010, 1045, 3685, 2424, 2151, 3622, 3350, 2005, 2049, 2224, 1999, 9805, 21531, 5649, 17105, 6974, 1012, 1996, 3347, 16782, 2532, 6402, 13734, 4213, 2595, 2006, 1037, 2193, 1997, 6642, 2648, 1996, 6123, 1997, 9805, 21531, 5649, 17105, 1006, 2156, 10381, 1012, 1021, 1007, 1998, 2009, 2003, 3278, 2008, 2116, 2060, 6048, 5254, 1996, 2224, 1997, 1520, 5610, 2013, 5255, 7861, 17198, 1521, 1010, 1520, 24604, 1998, 7861, 17198, 1521, 1010, 1520, 5255, 24604, 1521, 1010, 1520, 11865, 4328, 12540, 1521, 1010, 4385, 1012, 1010, 1999, 3599, 2122, 2168, 18046, 1012, 6195, 2008, 1996, 13734, 4213, 2595, 1999, 3160, 1006, 8292, 6824, 2368, 1007, 2003, 2081, 4321, 2013, 24604, 1010, 2122, 7604, 6592, 2008, 2049, 8887, 2224, 2089, 2022, 2062, 6923, 2084, 2453, 2012, 2034, 2022, 4011, 1012, 3251, 2030, 2025, 13734, 4213, 2595, 2003, 1010, 2030, 2001, 1010, 2036, 2109, 1999, 1996, 6123, 1997, 9805, 21531, 5649, 17105, 1045, 3685, 2360, 1010, 2021, 2045, 2003, 3350, 2013, 10661, 2005, 1996, 4598, 1997, 2242, 2066, 1996, 13734, 4213, 2595, 2175, 3126, 2094, 5921, 1996, 10722, 9126, 2080, 1006, 2156, 10381, 1012, 1021, 1010, 1050, 2078, 1012, 2570, 1998, 2382, 1007, 1012, 2633, 1010, 2009, 2442, 2022, 4197, 2041, 2008, 1996, 8887, 2224, 1997, 13734, 4213, 2595, 2003, 4089, 17092, 1010, 2926, 2076, 5909, 2160, 17105, 1010, 6576, 2138, 2009, 2003, 2625, 3239, 1011, 9105, 2084, 9805, 21531, 5649, 5693, 1998, 8887, 23016, 1010, 1998, 6576, 2138, 2009, 3504, 1998, 14747, 2200, 2066, 1996, 24604, 2008, 2003, 2109, 2000, 2422, 1996, 2160, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9550222754478455, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Diseases are believed to result from the failure to observe specific food restrictions, or as the result of sorcery.

It is common shamanic practice to ask a patient about his dreams and nightmares and about his food intake, and occasionally the shaman will even prescribe a narcotic potion and then will question the patient about his hallucinations. Should he see threatening animals, such as gigantic tapir, devouring serpents or seductive deer maidens the diagnosis is likely to refer to overhunting or to broken food taboos. This means that illness is thought to be caused by vengeful game animals but here another metaphoric level must be taken into account; the animals, as we have seen, are people and since food and sex are often equated, this disquieting imagery will be thought to refer to the patient\u2019s sexual fantasies, and so the problem of exogamy will once more be brought into focus. Food restrictions, hunting ritual and culinary practices are very closely related to mate recognition and selection because of certain underlying olfactory/pheromonal aspects, and form a complex network of beliefs and practices.

This principle of fertilization has, however, a somewhat ambivalent character. In the first place, the Milky Way is the zone of communication where contact between terrestrial beings and supernatural beings is established. These contacts are obtained by means of hallucinogenic drugs or, at least, by means of visions induced by a state of profound concentration. The Milky Way is directly designated as the \u201czone of hallucinations and visions\u201d into which the pay\u00e9 and other persons who take a hallucinogenic drug can penetrate and thereby pass from one cosmic level to another. This zone is dominated by Vih\u00f3-mahs\u00eb, the divine personification of the vih\u00f3 powder ( Piptadenia ) who, in a state of perpetual trance, travels along this celestial way observing the earth and its inhabitants. In their trance the pay\u00e9s rise to the Milky Way to ask Vih\u00f3-mahs\u00eb to serve as intermediary with the other divine personifications, Em\u00ebk\u00f3ri-mahs\u00eb, Diro\u00e1-mahs\u00eb, or Va\u00ed-mahs\u00eb . But on the other hand, the Milky Way is the dwelling place of the sicknesses. It can be thought of as a large, rising river in whose turbulent and foaming waters float residue and waste; these are the essences of putrefaction and, consequently, are very dangerous pathogenic factors for living beings. Putrefaction is the same as illness, and Vih\u00f3-mahs\u00eb can channel the current in such a way that illnesses come to contaminate the earth. The Milky Way is also the place where the vultures live, or the \u201cancient eagles.\u201d These are large birds that feed on carrion and are therefore closely associated The Structure of the Desana Cosmos with putrefaction and sickness. At times, these birds offer their services to mankind and carry diseases from the earth to the sky, to put them there, using the Milky Way as a kind of \u201cdungheap\u201d where these noxious elements float and drift forever.

Since the birds mentioned occupy a similar position, the Milky Way is a zone of great danger. In the dimension of hallucinations man can obtain good and find divine illumination, but, in taking undue advantage of this state, he can also cause evil.

When the funerary ritual was established, the Daughter of the Sun decided to bury her son in a place called ab\u00e9-gor\u00f3, the \u201cfirst cemetery.\u201d This name and place pose an interesting problem. Ab\u00e9 means sun, but the word gor\u00f3 is difficult to translate because it encompasses various meanings. Gor\u00f3 means, in general terms, a \u201cclean place, good to live,\u201d a \u201clot,\u201d an \u201copen place.\u201d But the mythical place designated as ab\u00e9 gor\u00f3 is also called ye\u2019\u00e9ri gor\u00f3 / place of coitus. This connection explains to us the meaning of the word. Gor\u00f3 is derived from go\u2019o /flower, go\u2019\u00f3ri /flowers, and the informant explains that it is \u201ca place as attractive as a flower.\u201d As we have seen on previous occasions, from the metaphorical level we now pass to the level of sexual physiology, and we are not surprised then to learn that the word flower is a synonym for vagina in Desana symbolism. It also happens that ab\u00e9 gor\u00f3 is used as a synonym for the rocks of Wainamb\u00ed Rapids where the original act of incest occurred. Ab\u00e9 gor\u00f3, the informant continues, is a place \u201cwhere tracks are left,\u201d and we have mentioned already the petroglyphs of Wainamb\u00ed that are interpreted as a pictorial record of the event that occurred there. But the concept of \u201ctrack\u201d has still another meaning.

In this case the semen is interpreted as an element causing sickness that materializes in the form of hairs, and the places where the ancestors have cohabited, either the Sun or the ancestors of the phratries, are then considered as cemeteries.

We know that for the Desana any phenomenon related to sexual physiology is interpreted as a \u201ctransformation,\u201d whether it is coitus, gestation, or birth. The phallic jaguar now commits an imaginary act upon his victum, a sexual imposition that is the equivalent of a magic violation followed by a pathological impregnation. So the illness is the result of a sexual act, etiologically imagined as a supernatural phenomenon, but morally seen as a fact. Coitus is sickness (or death), and this is the message that the symbolism carries. For the Desana, sexuality, in any form, connotes serious danger, and the most adequate exemplifying condition is disease.

For example, if a pregnant woman goes to the river to bathe without having made the prescribed invocations, Va\u00ed-mahs\u00eb can cause her to have a tumor, i.e., a difficult childbirth, by putting a small crystal (semen) into her body. Instead of caressing the woman, Va\u00ed-mahs\u00eb strikes her furiously because he was not the one who caused her to be pregnant.

This illness is designated as \u201cmadness,\u201d as a psychological condition in which the individual seems to be in a catatonic state. This condition is explained in the following way: the ka\u2019\u00ed (mind) of the patient has been attracted by a \u201cthicket in the jungle\u201d full of thorns and vines. The patient, coming originally from an open, empty place, goes step by step toward a dark thicket without knowing where he is going. The cure is in this case the responsibility of the kum\u00fa who attempts to \u201cawaken\u201d the person by giving him advice. This advice is formulated in these words: \u201cEveryone wears a loincloth, but a madman does not want to have one; he tears it off. Sexual organs should not be exposed; people will make fun. Only animals expose them; but we are not animals.\u201d This \u201cadvice\u201d alludes to the frequent tendency of persons who are said to be mentally disturbed or who are under the influence of a hallucinogenic drug to take off all their clothes and to defecate in public. On the other hand, the kum\u00fa attempts to reincorporate the patient into the normal life of the group. He says to him: \u201cYou are an important person in our phratry. You are a great singer, a good dancer, a man of good habits. You should not humble yourself in this manner.\u201d If this \u201cadvice\u201d does not have the desired results, the kum\u00fa invokes Diro\u00e1-mahs\u00eb and then calls up the crab ( gam\u00ed ) so that it will act as a guide to the patient. A desirable quality of the crab is the yellowish color of its raw meat and the red color of its cooked meat, but of more importance still are the slow, cautious steps by which this crustacean moves while observing everything with his periscopic eyes.

In many malocas forest animals are kept, small mammals or birds that the natives raise with great care. They are not kept as pets or raised as a pastime or for their pleasant company; rather, in the keeping of these animals very practical aims are pursued. It is believed that these animals have defensive qualities, in the sense that they attract contagious diseases that come near the maloca, thereby protecting the occupants of the dwelling. The principal animals raised for this purpose are, in the first place, those that assimilate the danger of such epidemic diseases as measles or smallpox. They are the rodents: the paca, the guinea pig, and others. The first two frequently have fleas, and these are said to \u201cdevour\u201d the disease without the animal itself suffering any consequences. The guinea pigs also attract contagious diseases, and as this small animal hides for preference in a manioc squeezer that lies on the floor, the disease follows it there and is \u201cdevoured\u201d by the squeezer. Monkeys are raised to neutralize other contagious diseases, but they generally die as a consequence of it. Among the birds raised, the oropendola is important because it is said to destroy all contagion with its strong beak. The trumpeter bird neutralizes the diseases of women and children; this bird will often hide under a hammock and, as it has a very sharp eyesight, it can see when illnesses approach, and it then moves the hammock with its back so that its owner will not be exposed to any contagion. The trumpeter bird is called mo\u00e1 bor\u00e9bu (from mo\u00e1 /meat, in Cubeo, and bor\u00e9ri /to turn white, to dawn, to mature). Bor\u00e9 also means \u201cbundle,\u201d and this bird is thus called \u201cwhite bundle,\u201d a term that expresses a principle of good and protection. The meat of this animal is very white and \u201cinoffensive\u201d because the trumpeter bird can never be an instrument of Va\u00ed-mahs\u00eb . The small parakeets that nest in hollow tree trunks and are raised in the malocas exemplify good care and the protection that ought to be given to small children. Also the tinamou is raised as a personification of the \u201cgood life\u201d and good health. It is also an \u201cinoffensive\u201d animal, an expression that refers to its meat, often given to sick persons. Feathers are extracted from macaws, and the skin of the birds is rubbed with a resin that eventually produces a plumage of a brilliant yellow color (tapirage). On the whole, birds of yellow or orange feathers are preferred because their bright colors are associated with the power of the sun.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2070, 2345, 9420, 2024, 1999, 2344, 2182, 7175, 1996, 4145, 1997, 4652, 3512, 4200, 1012, 1999, 2116, 15451, 24755, 2015, 3224, 4176, 2024, 2921, 1010, 2235, 11993, 2030, 5055, 2008, 1996, 12493, 5333, 2007, 2307, 2729, 1012, 2027, 2024, 2025, 2921, 2004, 18551, 2030, 2992, 2004, 1037, 2627, 14428, 2030, 2005, 2037, 8242, 2194, 1025, 2738, 1010, 1999, 1996, 4363, 1997, 2122, 4176, 2200, 6742, 8704, 2024, 9505, 1012, 2009, 2003, 3373, 2008, 2122, 4176, 2031, 5600, 11647, 1010, 1999, 1996, 3168, 2008, 2027, 9958, 9530, 15900, 6313, 7870, 2008, 2272, 2379, 1996, 15451, 24755, 1010, 8558, 8650, 1996, 18837, 1997, 1996, 13160, 1012, 1996, 4054, 4176, 2992, 2005, 2023, 3800, 2024, 1010, 1999, 1996, 2034, 2173, 1010, 2216, 2008, 4632, 27605, 13806, 1996, 5473, 1997, 2107, 16311, 7870, 2004, 2033, 3022, 4244, 2030, 25765, 1012, 2027, 2024, 1996, 28156, 1024, 1996, 14397, 2050, 1010, 1996, 7102, 10369, 1010, 1998, 2500, 1012, 1996, 2034, 2048, 4703, 2031, 26735, 2015, 1010, 1998, 2122, 2024, 2056, 2000, 1523, 16475, 8162, 1524, 1996, 4295, 2302, 1996, 4111, 2993, 6114, 2151, 8465, 1012, 1996, 7102, 14695, 2036, 9958, 9530, 15900, 6313, 7870, 1010, 1998, 2004, 2023, 2235, 4111, 17382, 2005, 12157, 1999, 1037, 23624, 10085, 11025, 2099, 2008, 3658, 2006, 1996, 2723, 1010, 1996, 4295, 4076, 2009, 2045, 1998, 2003, 1523, 16475, 16777, 1524, 2011, 1996, 11025, 2099, 1012, 17059, 2024, 2992, 2000, 8699, 4697, 2060, 9530, 15900, 6313, 7870, 1010, 2021, 2027, 3227, 3280, 2004, 1037, 9509, 1997, 2009, 1012, 2426, 1996, 5055, 2992, 1010, 1996, 20298, 11837, 3527, 2721, 2003, 2590, 2138, 2009, 2003, 2056, 2000, 6033, 2035, 9530, 15900, 3258, 2007, 2049, 2844, 23525, 1012, 1996, 28220, 4743, 8699, 10057, 1996, 7870, 1997, 2308, 1998, 2336, 1025, 2023, 4743, 2097, 2411, 5342, 2104, 1037, 10654, 5302, 3600, 1998, 1010, 2004, 2009, 2038, 1037, 2200, 4629, 2159, 18743, 1010, 2009, 2064, 2156, 2043, 24757, 3921, 1010, 1998, 2009, 2059, 5829, 1996, 10654, 5302, 3600, 2007, 2049, 2067, 2061, 2008, 2049, 3954, 2097, 2025, 2022, 6086, 2000, 2151, 9530, 15900, 3258, 1012, 1996, 28220, 4743, 2003, 2170, 9587, 2050, 8501, 8569, 1006, 2013, 9587, 2050, 1013, 6240, 1010, 1999, 14291, 2080, 1010, 1998, 8501, 3089, 1013, 2000, 2735, 2317, 1010, 2000, 6440, 1010, 2000, 9677, 1007, 1012, 8501, 2036, 2965, 1523, 14012, 1010, 1524, 1998, 2023, 4743, 2003, 2947, 2170, 1523, 2317, 14012, 1010, 1524, 1037, 2744, 2008, 16783, 1037, 6958, 1997, 2204, 1998, 3860, 1012, 1996, 6240, 1997, 2023, 4111, 2003, 2200, 2317, 1998, 1523, 1999, 7245, 6132, 3512, 1524, 2138, 1996, 28220, 4743, 2064, 2196, 2022, 2019, 6602, 1997, 12436, 2072, 1011, 5003, 7898, 2063, 1012, 1996, 2235, 11498, 20553, 3215, 2008, 9089, 1999, 8892, 3392, 20509, 1998, 2024, 2992, 1999, 1996, 15451, 24755, 2015, 4654, 6633, 28250, 2204, 2729, 1998, 1996, 3860, 2008, 11276, 2000, 2022, 2445, 2000, 2235, 2336, 1012, 2036, 1996, 11958, 5302, 2226, 2003, 2992, 2004, 1037, 2711, 9031, 1997, 1996, 1523, 2204, 2166, 1524, 1998, 2204, 2740, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2036, 2019, 1523, 1999, 7245, 6132, 3512, 1524, 4111, 1010, 2019, 3670, 2008, 5218, 2000, 2049, 102]}, {"score": 0.8767876625061035, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "In the decoration of the skin by means of pigments for the feast of Dabukur\u00ed , it is always the woman who applies the paint to the man, besides dressing him with his garb of feathers.

My own observations along the Cuduiar\u00ed covered 30. Altogether, there is now a combined list of 62. 4 See the end of this chapter. Since the masks are intended to portray all the living creatures of the Cubeo world the number of masks is potentially vast. No one ceremony uses them all. There are, however, key characters that are most commonly represented. These are Jaguar, Dung beetle, Carrion vulture, Butterfly, Arac\u00fa fishes, Eagle, Sloth, Parrot, Dragonfly, Minnows (who are not masked but are an important element in the ceremonial dramatization), Py\u00e9nk\u00fc (a small black fish), Frogs, and a variety of cannibalistic ogres or forest demons, the Ab\u00fahuwa . Informants would not say which of the masked representations was most important, presumably because invidiousness is, to the Cubeo, in poor taste. Judging, however, by their prominence, I would say that Jaguar, Butterfly, Ab\u00fahuwa, Dung beetles, Carrion vulture, and Arac\u00fa fishes were most important, more or less in that order. Except for the arac\u00fa, the esteemed fish of the region, these creatures all have an association with death. The jaguar is, of course, the dreaded sorcerer. The sorcerer is called yav\u00ed (jaguar) and the Cubeo regard any jaguar as likely to be either a sorcerer or a sorcerer\u2019s dog. The morpho butterfly with its beautiful blue wings is a creature of sorcerers and of evil. The information Koch-Gr\u00fcnberg received was that the morpho butterfly ( tat\u00e1rako ) lives at Yurupar\u00ed cachoeira on the Vaup\u00e9s, where he brews malaria in a calabash and strews it over the land (1909, II, 181).

What follows is a much abbreviated version of an account given me. About twenty years ago, Jos\u00e9 of An\u00fcyuht\u00ed longhouse went to hunt white-lipped peccaries. He shot one, which was especially fierce because its mate was about to give birth. The peccary gored Jos\u00e9 in the knee, but he killed it with his dogs. He limped back to the longhouse, carrying the dead peccary. The wound got very bad. Old Arturo, the most knowledgeable of Bar\u00e1 shamans, started a curing chant, but Jos\u00e9 was ready to die. His feet were already cold and only his heart moved. Old Arturo went to Ew\u00fcra wi, a longhouse near Ew\u00fcra tar\u00f3. 19 S. Hugh-Jones (personal communication) states that the Makuna and Taiwano eat snakes. He saw Jos\u00e9 already there, standing outside the door. He was putting on black body paint, festive ornaments, and feathers. His mother and his father were there, and many people awaited him. Jos\u00e9 had almost finished painting himself and was about to enter the longhouse. If he had entered, he would have died in this world. The people at An\u00fcyuht\u00ed were already crying. Old Arturo came and pushed Jos\u00e9 away from the doorway. Many peccaries were outside the house waiting, and Old Arturo began to scare them with his power. First he summoned a big wind. The peccaries said that wind had been around since the beginning of the world. Then Old Arturo summoned a tremendous fire, which did scare them. They lined up and began to enter the longhouse.

They boil the bark of the cipo dy\u00ed-d\u00e1 (cipo of blood) and apply the water to the wound. Or they also apply to wounds scrapings from the potato known as Kam \u0129 b\u00fcxk\u00f6-Ro-k\u00f3 (remedy against sores). Old ones . They wash them many times with the water in which has been boiled the water-edge cipo called M\u00f5\u00f5 \u00f6x\u2019s\u00e9-kapoar\u00ed (paraiba whiskers). 289 b) Against snake bite . 1st. Of Jararaca : they crush the leaves and the yellowish root of a shrub called precisely A\u00f1ak\u00f3 , jararaca remedy, and for this reason they cultivate it in the clearings. They apply them to the bites, and the sap or infusion of these leaves is also given as a drink. A variety of black root has an even more vigorous action. They also use the infusion of the sororoca root against the poison of the jararaca. For snake bites in general, they drink the sap of a cipo called P \u00ef r\u00f5-d\u00e1 (snake cipo), with a thick stem and abundant and pleasing sap, which they likewise use to quench their thirst when walking through the forest. In spite of these remedies of theirs, every year there is a certain number of victims of the snakes, and if this number is not larger they owe it to the remedies and serums obtained from the Mission. c) For toothache . They use a plant that burns like pepper, Pixk\u00f5-k\u00f3 , remedy-for-teeth. They burn the leaves and apply the ashes to the aching tooth. d) For sore eyes . 1st. If it is a matter of children, they scrape the bark of the minhoca cipo, Ahw\u00e3-da , leave it in infusion in mother\u2019s milk or, lacking this, in water, and afterwards they put some drops in the ailing eye, using a small funnel made out of arum\u00e3 leaf. For an identical purpose, and with the same process, they also use the guapu\u00ed , a parasitic plant with long aerial roots. When the patient is an adult person, they apply to the eye, in drops, an infusion made from the root of the cipo Waxsy\u00e3-d\u00e1 , after it has been washed well and grated. They also apply salt to the ailing eyes, pure or mixed with well-pulverized chicken manure. Probably the use of salt would be a suggestion from the civilized, applied, however, according to the native concept. e) For dysentery . They mix the latex of the plant Yo\u00e1-mot\u00f5 with water and take it warm. Or they eat tapioca mixed with the latex of the cipo Pixk\u00f5-s e- d\u00e1 (cipo of the bird \u201ctesoura\u201d / Muscivora tyrannus /). f) For stomach-ache . They grate a potato called Bar\u00e1 and leave the mass in cold water, and take it in small doses. Before taking it, however, they must transfer it from one cuia to another, always blowing on the substance. Without this precaution, they affirm, the remedy will kill the patient. g) They state that there are many varieties of the plant called Ta\u00e1-d\u00f6xk\u00e1 ( 45 .

Children are vulnerable because their souls are not firmly established within their physical beings, and can wander out of the body almost at will. The most common way for a child's soul to escape is to leave by way of the mouth when the child cries. Thus, mothers are quick to hush a bawling baby in order to prevent its soul from escaping. The child's soul can be recovered by sweeping the ground in the vicinity where it most probably escaped, calling for it while sweeping the area with a particular kind of branch. I once helped gather up the soul of a sick child in this fashion, luring it back into the sick baby. One of the contributions I made, in addition to helping with the calling and sweeping, was a dose of medicine for the child's diarrhea.

At the time of contact there were five captive women in the population. In the postcontact period, Mucajai groups have been involved in four raids against other Yanomama groups. In 1959 there was much infectious disease. The resulting sickness and death was a new and frightening experience for the Mucajai community. In their efforts to explain what was happening, the Mucajai asked the Marashiteri. The Marashiteri said that the Shiriteri were performing witchcraft against the Mucajai. Since the Mucajai people had no contact with the Shiriteri and did not consider them enemies, they visited them to get an explanation. The Marashiteri acted as guides. The Marashiteri then warned the Shiriteri about hostile intentions of the Mucajai people, even though the Mucajai had not yet made any judgments about the Shiriteri. It appears that the Marashiteri were manipulating both groups for their own unknown purposes. When the Shiriteri showed themselves suspicious and reserved toward the Mucajai group and refused to give the customary offerings of food for visitors, the Mucajai people saw this as proof of the accusations made by the Marashiteri.

The previous chapter has shown how fertility with a balanced sex ratio at birth and free or captive female in-migration for marriage changed the age-sex distribution of the Mucajai group, especially by reducing the imbalanced sex ratio of the reproductive population. This chapter has shown how a changed age-sex structure has, in turn, changed the intensity of two cultural patterns. There was an increase in monogamous marriages and a corresponding decrease in polyandrous marriages. Where wife-sharing was retained, there was a diminution of the number of males in the sharing networks. The change in the Table 9.5 Schematic of Principal Demographic and Cultural Changes age--sex distribution also diminished the age difference between marital partners. This, in turn, increased the age differences between mothers-in-law and sons-in-law, thereby reducing potential sexual conflict within family groups. As a result the avoidance patterns between mothers-in-laws and sons-in-laws have diminished. Table 9.5 gives a synoptic view of these changes.

Through this, the Sur\u00e1ra chief Hewem\u00e3o explained to me, they are able to protect themselves and their families against sickness and accidents in an emergency. If, for example, a man is threatened along the way by a poisonous snake or a jaguar, he is now in a position to banish the danger by calling upon the tutelary spirits. He must never fail to thank the hekur\u00e1 after a successful hunting expedition or a good harvest, however, for otherwise he would incur their anger. Even when his wife, one of his children, or a relative falls ill, he himself must first try, by means of song and dance in which he addresses the hekur\u00e1, to hurl the sickness back to the hostile tribe from which it was sent. Only if his efforts remain unsuccessful may he appeal for the aid of the chief, who is always willing and, with the help of 8-9 assistants, carries out a great rekur\u00e1 (cure). Thus, during the day 68 or at night among the Sur\u00e1ra and Pakid\u00e1i one frequently sees one man, or often even several men, praying or attempting to cure a member of the family. Before that, however, they must take snuff-powder because contact with the hekur\u00e1 can be made only in a state of intoxication. The songs are somewhat monotonous and are combined with animal sounds, animal movements, such as the beating of wings, 68 cont. hopping, etc. The other members of the tribe pay no attention to such prayers and magic performances. Only the chiefs and their student helpers sometimes listen more carefully. Then it sometimes happened that Hewem\u00e3o would shake his head and tell me that this or that man was praying all wrong, he had undoubtedly not paid sufficient attention during the lessons.

I owe it to him alone that I was able to penetrate more deeply into the mental culture of the Sur\u00e1ra and Pakid\u00e1i and put together a complete vocabulary 564 Three years ago the little boy suffered dangerous burns on the abdomen by an upset vessel containing boiling tree resin. Since the chief had given up hope that he would recover, he wanted to have him given the deathblow. The custom of this tribe, as well as that of the Pakid\u00e1i, decrees that all old and seriously ill persons who are no longer able to take part in the general migrations must be killed (see pp. 153/154). The grandmother of the little boy, who is an orphan took him secretly one night to the hut of the Spanish palm-fiber gatherer, Manoel Antonio Gomez, who succeeded in saving his life. The chief was said to have been very angry at first over the arbitrary action of the grandmother, but then, when he saw that the little one had recovered, he calmed down. . 118 cont.

Dr. Clements in his study has apparently left out (at least he has not specifically mentioned) the important pre-Dravidian tribes of Chota-Nagpur such as Santals, Hos, Mundas, etc., and thus in his distribution map No. 2 this portion of India is not shaded as it ought to have been. He has shown this idea to be almost universal in the New World and extended up to Siberia. Another area is shown in South-Eastern Asia and the Santal under consideration would show a continuous distribution of this from Chota-Nagpur to the Pacific area. Other centres in Europe. Western Asia and Africa are recorded as being capable of tentative connections with the area of the Santal and South-Eastern Asia. The tejo concept of the Santal is identical with the disease-object intrusion concept in other areas. According to Dr. Clements (to whom the Santal area is unknown) \u201cthe criterion is the actual presence in the body of a tangible, supposedly pathogenic substance. Now although the exact nature of this substance varies considerably, such variation is quite haphazard. That is to say, there is no regional differentiation, the most common intruders being small pebbles, bits of leather, sticks, little bones, hairs, coagulated blood, insects, and even small animals. 1 Dr. F.E. Clements, op. cit., p. 211. \u201d The idea of dental diseases due to worms in the teeth is not only known in the Santal area but is common in Bengal and perhaps other parts of India, and is treated in India generally by wandering gypsies called \u2018Bedia\u2019 who might have been a distributing agency of this idea in other parts of the Old World. The distribution of the disease-object intrusion concepts in South-Eastern Asia, and perhaps in Western Asia also, may be centered in India if we take the whole as a continuous area of which information has not been collected from some parts of Persia. The old Hindu theory of fever (Jvara) is that it is brought about by a intruding disease-demon (Jvarasur) which finds its way into the body of the afflicted through a disease-object. Could it be suggested that the disease-object intrusion idea was taken up by the Hindu from an earlier surviving primitive concept and incorporated into the systematised medical treatment through which it diffused to Western Asia on the one hand and Indonesia on the other?

The highest divinity recognised by the Santal is Kando, the Supreme Being, the Creator. He is the only one who can give and restore life and who has created the trees, plants, animals, etc. 2. The spirits of dead ancestors are placed by the Santals in a separate class by themselves. 3. The next is composed of household spirits known as Orak bongas and tutelary spirits known as Abge bongas . The names of the Orak bonga are the following: 1. Baspahar. 2. Deswali. 3. Seas 4. Goraya 5. Barpahar. 6. Sarchawdi. 7. Thuntatursa. The names of the Abge bonga are the following: 1. Darasore or Dharasanda. 2. Ketkomkudra 3. Champa denagarh. 4. Garsinka. 5. Lilachandi. 6. Dhanghara. 7. Kudracandi. 8. Barhara. 9. Duarseri. 10. Kudraj. 11. Gasain Era. 12. Achali 13. Deswali. 14. Pahardana. It may be noted here that the Santal would not divulge the name of his Orak bonga and Abge bonga to any one but his eldest son and I was fortunate to get the names from the Christian converts. 4. The fourth class is the hunting spirit known as Rongo ruji, a bonga to whom worship is made on the night before the men start for the annual tribal hunt with utterly obscene songs and practices. 5. The fifth class of spirits are the village deities, which are the following: 1. Jaher Era (female). 2. Gosain Era (female). 3. Truko Muruko (male). 4. Marang Buru (male). 5. Parganat (male). The Santals worship the above deities periodically in the sacred grove. 6. There are spirits of the village boundary known as Sima bongas, and of the outskirt of the village known as Bahre bongas . 7. Next come tramp or stray spirits who are spirits of persons and children dying an unnatural death. 8. The spirit of the father-in-law\u2019s household, as is believed, sometime follows the bride to her new house which is known as Naihar bonga . As soon as a Santal is convinced that the Naihar bonga has come along he will either make yearly sacrifices to him, or, as there is some risk connected with it as one does not know the requirements of the foreign bonga, he will make arrangements to send him back at once, for by himself he will not return. If either is not done the consequences are disease and death in the house. Another spirit that must be exercised 1 [Erratum: this should read \u201cexorcised.\u201d Cf. errata sheet, p. x -- Analyst] is Kisar bonga . The Kisar bonga is of a rather uncertain character. A man who has got such a bonga into his house will be wealthy through him as he steals from others and carries all to the house of his master, but if he is offended there is no end to the mischief he will make. If on his account disease is brought into a family, the whole of it will be exterminated if the Kisar bonga is not effectually sent away from the house. 9. The last to be grouped are the spirits or rather mysterious powers residing in or connected with certain objects such as battle-axe ( Kapi Karan bonga and Bhalus Bijai bonga . Bhalu is most likely a shortened form of Bhalua Kapi, the name of a common form of their battle-axe), and some weird natural objects such as an abnormally gnarled bamboo-shoot, tree-roots, some weird-looking fantastic-shaped hills or a roaring cataract, a waterfall or a tank-side. These spirits are not objects of worship nor do they receive sacrifices but are mischievous spirits who have to be scared away or exorcised by the ojha (spirit-doctor).", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1015, 1012, 1996, 3284, 16968, 7843, 2011, 1996, 4203, 2140, 2003, 22827, 3527, 1010, 1996, 4259, 2108, 1010, 1996, 8543, 1012, 2002, 2003, 1996, 2069, 2028, 2040, 2064, 2507, 1998, 9239, 2166, 1998, 2040, 2038, 2580, 1996, 3628, 1010, 4264, 1010, 4176, 1010, 4385, 1012, 1016, 1012, 1996, 8633, 1997, 2757, 10748, 2024, 2872, 2011, 1996, 4203, 4877, 1999, 1037, 3584, 2465, 2011, 3209, 1012, 1017, 1012, 1996, 2279, 2003, 3605, 1997, 4398, 8633, 2124, 2004, 2030, 4817, 14753, 12617, 1998, 10722, 9834, 5649, 8633, 2124, 2004, 11113, 3351, 14753, 12617, 1012, 1996, 3415, 1997, 1996, 2030, 4817, 14753, 3654, 2024, 1996, 2206, 1024, 1015, 1012, 19021, 4502, 8167, 1012, 1016, 1012, 4078, 13476, 2072, 1012, 1017, 1012, 11915, 1018, 1012, 26967, 3148, 1019, 1012, 3347, 4502, 8167, 1012, 1020, 1012, 18906, 7507, 21724, 2072, 1012, 1021, 1012, 16215, 16671, 4017, 9236, 2050, 1012, 1996, 3415, 1997, 1996, 11113, 3351, 14753, 3654, 2024, 1996, 2206, 1024, 1015, 1012, 18243, 3022, 5686, 2030, 28144, 5400, 8791, 2850, 1012, 1016, 1012, 17710, 2102, 3683, 2213, 5283, 7265, 1017, 1012, 24782, 2050, 7939, 16098, 25032, 1012, 1018, 1012, 11721, 2869, 19839, 2050, 1012, 1019, 1012, 19286, 14856, 4305, 1012, 1020, 1012, 28144, 5654, 11077, 1012, 1021, 1012, 13970, 7265, 9336, 4305, 1012, 1022, 1012, 3347, 11077, 1012, 1023, 1012, 4241, 11650, 11124, 1012, 2184, 1012, 13970, 7265, 3501, 1012, 2340, 1012, 3806, 8113, 3690, 1012, 2260, 1012, 9353, 8865, 2072, 2410, 1012, 4078, 13476, 2072, 1012, 2403, 1012, 6643, 11783, 5162, 1012, 2009, 2089, 2022, 3264, 2182, 2008, 1996, 4203, 2140, 2052, 2025, 4487, 19722, 28875, 1996, 2171, 1997, 2010, 2030, 4817, 14753, 3654, 1998, 11113, 3351, 14753, 3654, 2000, 2151, 2028, 2021, 2010, 7310, 2365, 1998, 1045, 2001, 19590, 2000, 2131, 1996, 3415, 2013, 1996, 3017, 19884, 1012, 1018, 1012, 1996, 2959, 2465, 2003, 1996, 5933, 4382, 2124, 2004, 6902, 3995, 21766, 4478, 1010, 1037, 14753, 3654, 2000, 3183, 7425, 2003, 2081, 2006, 1996, 2305, 2077, 1996, 2273, 2707, 2005, 1996, 3296, 8807, 5690, 2007, 12580, 27744, 2774, 1998, 6078, 1012, 1019, 1012, 1996, 3587, 2465, 1997, 8633, 2024, 1996, 2352, 17091, 1010, 2029, 2024, 1996, 2206, 1024, 1015, 1012, 14855, 5886, 3690, 1006, 2931, 1007, 1012, 1016, 1012, 2175, 15816, 2078, 3690, 1006, 2931, 1007, 1012, 1017, 1012, 19817, 6968, 2080, 14163, 6820, 3683, 1006, 3287, 1007, 1012, 1018, 1012, 13955, 3070, 20934, 6820, 1006, 3287, 1007, 1012, 1019, 1012, 11968, 5289, 4017, 1006, 3287, 1007, 1012, 1996, 4203, 4877, 7425, 1996, 2682, 17091, 18043, 1999, 1996, 6730, 7676, 1012, 1020, 1012, 2045, 2024, 8633, 1997, 1996, 2352, 6192, 2124, 2004, 26769, 14753, 12617, 1010, 1998, 1997, 1996, 21100, 23630, 2102, 1997, 1996, 2352, 2124, 2004, 8670, 28362, 14753, 12617, 1012, 1021, 1012, 2279, 2272, 12517, 2361, 2030, 15926, 8633, 2040, 2024, 8633, 1997, 5381, 1998, 2336, 5996, 2019, 21242, 2331, 1012, 1022, 1012, 1996, 4382, 1997, 1996, 2269, 1011, 1999, 1011, 2375, 1521, 1055, 4398, 1010, 2004, 2003, 3373, 1010, 8811, 4076, 1996, 8959, 2000, 2014, 2047, 2160, 2029, 2003, 2124, 2004, 6583, 19190, 2906, 14753, 3654, 1012, 2004, 2574, 102]}, {"score": 0.9567703008651733, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Our ancestors of old have left us a word, viz.: Once in your life, somehow or other, do sacrifice to the Si\u0144 bonga, even when you are poor, and when you have the means, do sacrifice to him every fifth or sixth year, otherwise he will not call you good in the next world.

He takes two sal -leaves with prominent veins, and having rubbed oil here and there on one leaf, he says that such a part of the leaf is for disease, and such a part for witches, for bongas, and so on, then he covers the first leaf with the second one, salutes, and, muttering a mantar, puts the leaves on the ground. After a short while he takes them up again, salutes and removes the covering leaf; after having scrutinized the leaf, he announces the result. It is unnecessary to say that the ojha arranges the result, and that he does it according to what he understands is the common opinion of those who have engaged him.

They are bitterly opposed to each other\u2019s influence, and they clash for the most part on the battleground of sickness and disease. An exhaustive treatise on the Santal attitude to disease has been published, and shows conclusively that, as with ghosts so with sickness, the ideas of the Santals are common to all the lower strata of society in North India. 1 P. O. Bodding, Studies in Santal Medicine and Connected Folklore, Memoirs of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. X. These ideas are not simple but complex, and range from the realm of the rational to the fantastic. Disease is sometimes ascribed to natural causes, particularly when the chain of causation is fairly obvious and can be repeated in a series of experiments; there is a whole class of food described as batol, which means that it is unwholesome. There are hundreds of remedies that require no supernatural aid to make them effective. Some remedies are the property of all, while others are the property of individuals and the knowledge of their ingredients is a closely guarded secret. Chaitan of Churimara began his career as a physician in response to a specific need. When he was a young man a friend had come to him in great distress and said that his boy was vomiting blood. He turned to Chaitan and asked him if he knew of any medicine that would be good for the boy. Chaitan was so sorry for his friend that he promised to do something, although when he said this he had no notion what he should do. As he was setting out for his friend\u2019s house he prayed to Cando and asked that he might be shown what he ought to do; at the same time he shut his eyes and kicked at the soil. As he opened his eyes again he saw a plant, which he immediately dug up. He ground the roots to make a medicine, and the boy recovered from his sickness. Since then he has applied the same remedy to many other cases. One of his patients had been extremely ill, he said, but was now the father of four or five children!

He consults the oracles in order to discover whether natural causes are to blame, in which case it is called plain rua, or sickness, or whether it is necessary to lay the responsibility on a witch, a bonga or a displeased ancestor. He sits down in the courtyard and waits until two sarjom leaves and some mustard oil in a leaf cup are brought to him. Holding one of the leaves in his left hand, he dips his right index finger in the oil and sprinkles some drops on the ground as an offering to the spirits. While doing so he asks for guidance in determining the correct cause of the illness or fatality. He then puts a drop of oil into each of the compartments of the leaf that he is holding, one drop representing one possible agency of evil. There is one for natural causes, three or four for different bongas, and other drops represent households in which there may be a witch, including the sick man\u2019s house, his father-in-law\u2019s house, the houses on the other side of the village street, and so on. When the drops are in position the ojha rubs the two leaves together and then holds the first leaf up to the light to discern the shapes that have been taken by the oil. He pronounces the cause of the disease in accordance with the pattern that he sees. If he decides that the bongas are displeased, he performs the ceremony known as bul mayam in much the same manner as the village co-priest does during the festivals. The blood which he draws from his arm, chest or thigh is mixed with some sundried rice until the whole is saturated. The ojha then proceeds to scatter the rice on the ground and prays to the spirits to spare the sick man from further interference. He confirms his diagnosis by oracle by examining the patient and in particular by feeling his pulse, and apart from his power with the spirits he has a stock-in-trade that includes many remedies, spells, and also powers of exorcism. This is resorted to at once in certain cases such as snake bite. The ojha squats down beside the sick person and takes in his left hand a peacock feather or sometimes one or two twigs from an old broom, and these he passes along the patient\u2019s body without touching it, moving from the head to the feet and chanting the correct spells as he does so.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2043, 1996, 4203, 2140, 1051, 3501, 3270, 2003, 2170, 1999, 2055, 1037, 2553, 1997, 15556, 2030, 1997, 5573, 2331, 1010, 2010, 2034, 3853, 2003, 2000, 3046, 2000, 5646, 1996, 2828, 2000, 2029, 1996, 3327, 28616, 13028, 9816, 7460, 1012, 2002, 23363, 2015, 1996, 14721, 2015, 1999, 2344, 2000, 7523, 3251, 3019, 5320, 2024, 2000, 7499, 1010, 1999, 2029, 2553, 2009, 2003, 2170, 5810, 21766, 2050, 1010, 2030, 15556, 1010, 2030, 3251, 2009, 2003, 4072, 2000, 3913, 1996, 5368, 2006, 1037, 6965, 1010, 1037, 14753, 3654, 2030, 1037, 4487, 13102, 19738, 6924, 13032, 1012, 2002, 7719, 2091, 1999, 1996, 10119, 1998, 18074, 2127, 2048, 18906, 5558, 2213, 3727, 1998, 2070, 23187, 3514, 1999, 1037, 7053, 2452, 2024, 2716, 2000, 2032, 1012, 3173, 2028, 1997, 1996, 3727, 1999, 2010, 2187, 2192, 1010, 2002, 16510, 2015, 2010, 2157, 5950, 4344, 1999, 1996, 3514, 1998, 11867, 6657, 19099, 2015, 2070, 9010, 2006, 1996, 2598, 2004, 2019, 5378, 2000, 1996, 8633, 1012, 2096, 2725, 2061, 2002, 5176, 2005, 8606, 1999, 12515, 1996, 6149, 3426, 1997, 1996, 7355, 2030, 10611, 3012, 1012, 2002, 2059, 8509, 1037, 4530, 1997, 3514, 2046, 2169, 1997, 1996, 27998, 1997, 1996, 7053, 2008, 2002, 2003, 3173, 1010, 2028, 4530, 5052, 2028, 2825, 4034, 1997, 4763, 1012, 2045, 2003, 2028, 2005, 3019, 5320, 1010, 2093, 2030, 2176, 2005, 2367, 14753, 12617, 1010, 1998, 2060, 9010, 5050, 3911, 1999, 2029, 2045, 2089, 2022, 1037, 6965, 1010, 2164, 1996, 5305, 2158, 1521, 1055, 2160, 1010, 2010, 2269, 1011, 1999, 1011, 2375, 1521, 1055, 2160, 1010, 1996, 3506, 2006, 1996, 2060, 2217, 1997, 1996, 2352, 2395, 1010, 1998, 2061, 2006, 1012, 2043, 1996, 9010, 2024, 1999, 2597, 1996, 1051, 3501, 3270, 28860, 1996, 2048, 3727, 2362, 1998, 2059, 4324, 1996, 2034, 7053, 2039, 2000, 1996, 2422, 2000, 5860, 11795, 1996, 10466, 2008, 2031, 2042, 2579, 2011, 1996, 3514, 1012, 2002, 4013, 3630, 17457, 2015, 1996, 3426, 1997, 1996, 4295, 1999, 10388, 2007, 1996, 5418, 2008, 2002, 5927, 1012, 2065, 2002, 7288, 2008, 1996, 14753, 12617, 2024, 4487, 13102, 19738, 6924, 1010, 2002, 10438, 1996, 5103, 2124, 2004, 20934, 2140, 9815, 2213, 1999, 2172, 1996, 2168, 5450, 2004, 1996, 2352, 2522, 1011, 5011, 2515, 2076, 1996, 7519, 1012, 1996, 2668, 2029, 2002, 9891, 2013, 2010, 2849, 1010, 3108, 2030, 10120, 2003, 3816, 2007, 2070, 3103, 13626, 6340, 5785, 2127, 1996, 2878, 2003, 23489, 1012, 1996, 1051, 3501, 3270, 2059, 10951, 2000, 8040, 20097, 1996, 5785, 2006, 1996, 2598, 1998, 11839, 2015, 2000, 1996, 8633, 2000, 8622, 1996, 5305, 2158, 2013, 2582, 11099, 1012, 2002, 23283, 2010, 11616, 2011, 14721, 2011, 12843, 1996, 5776, 1998, 1999, 3327, 2011, 3110, 2010, 8187, 1010, 1998, 4237, 2013, 2010, 2373, 2007, 1996, 8633, 2002, 2038, 1037, 4518, 1011, 1999, 1011, 3119, 2008, 2950, 2116, 2128, 7583, 3111, 1010, 11750, 1010, 1998, 2036, 4204, 1997, 4654, 2953, 22987, 2213, 1012, 2023, 2003, 7001, 2098, 2000, 2012, 2320, 1999, 3056, 3572, 2107, 2004, 7488, 6805, 1012, 1996, 1051, 3501, 3270, 26783, 2015, 2091, 3875, 1996, 5305, 2711, 1998, 3138, 1999, 2010, 2187, 2192, 1037, 18931, 15550, 2030, 2823, 2028, 2030, 2048, 27964, 102]}, {"score": 0.961593508720398, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "The magician always warns his clients that there is a possibility of error in his diagnosis, for it is the common belief that witches can interfere with the process of divination in order to draw attention away from themselves. Sometimes at an early stage, but usually when the illness persists in spite of all attempts at a cure, the suspicion of witchcraft arises, and a second divination reveals that a witch is at work. Once the suspicion has been voiced the whole village is concerned in the consultation, and the headman walks through the village exclaiming in a loud voice near each house: \u201cBeware, for if the sick man does not get well we shall deal with thee!\u201d More ojhas are consulted, and once agreement has been reached that witchcraft is operating, then steps have to be taken to locate the witch. The villagers are as a rule reluctant to proceed to this step and only do so when other measures have failed, for no one can tell in advance whether the witch will be found in his own house or not. At times frivolous accusations of witchcraft are made in order to pay off an old grudge, but the fear of the real thing is very strong. The oil divination has to be confirmed by some other means, one of which is the ordeal of placing twigs in water. Some freshly cut twigs are placed in the mud at the water\u2019s edge of a pond and vermilion is placed on them. The twigs represent the various households and spirits, as the drops of oil do in the oil and leaf method. The twig that withers first helps to fix the direction in which the villagers must look for the answer to their suspicions. Another method of divination is to place some rice wrapped in a leaf in a white-ant hill; if the ants attack the rice immediately, then witchcraft is involved.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 16669, 2467, 19428, 2010, 7846, 2008, 2045, 2003, 1037, 6061, 1997, 7561, 1999, 2010, 11616, 1010, 2005, 2009, 2003, 1996, 2691, 6772, 2008, 12566, 2064, 15115, 2007, 1996, 2832, 1997, 4487, 17948, 3508, 1999, 2344, 2000, 4009, 3086, 2185, 2013, 3209, 1012, 2823, 2012, 2019, 2220, 2754, 1010, 2021, 2788, 2043, 1996, 7355, 29486, 2015, 1999, 8741, 1997, 2035, 4740, 2012, 1037, 9526, 1010, 1996, 10928, 1997, 21599, 18653, 1010, 1998, 1037, 2117, 4487, 17948, 3508, 7657, 2008, 1037, 6965, 2003, 2012, 2147, 1012, 2320, 1996, 10928, 2038, 2042, 6126, 1996, 2878, 2352, 2003, 4986, 1999, 1996, 16053, 1010, 1998, 1996, 2132, 2386, 7365, 2083, 1996, 2352, 4654, 27640, 1999, 1037, 5189, 2376, 2379, 2169, 2160, 1024, 1523, 2022, 8059, 1010, 2005, 2065, 1996, 5305, 2158, 2515, 2025, 2131, 2092, 2057, 4618, 3066, 2007, 14992, 999, 1524, 2062, 1051, 3501, 14949, 2024, 17535, 1010, 1998, 2320, 3820, 2038, 2042, 2584, 2008, 21599, 2003, 4082, 1010, 2059, 4084, 2031, 2000, 2022, 2579, 2000, 12453, 1996, 6965, 1012, 1996, 11904, 2024, 2004, 1037, 3627, 11542, 2000, 10838, 2000, 2023, 3357, 1998, 2069, 2079, 2061, 2043, 2060, 5761, 2031, 3478, 1010, 2005, 2053, 2028, 2064, 2425, 1999, 5083, 3251, 1996, 6965, 2097, 2022, 2179, 1999, 2010, 2219, 2160, 2030, 2025, 1012, 2012, 2335, 10424, 20984, 15534, 13519, 1997, 21599, 2024, 2081, 1999, 2344, 2000, 3477, 2125, 2019, 2214, 24665, 15979, 1010, 2021, 1996, 3571, 1997, 1996, 2613, 2518, 2003, 2200, 2844, 1012, 1996, 3514, 4487, 17948, 3508, 2038, 2000, 2022, 4484, 2011, 2070, 2060, 2965, 1010, 2028, 1997, 2029, 2003, 1996, 23304, 1997, 6885, 27964, 1999, 2300, 1012, 2070, 20229, 3013, 27964, 2024, 2872, 1999, 1996, 8494, 2012, 1996, 2300, 1521, 1055, 3341, 1997, 1037, 8644, 1998, 2310, 28550, 18964, 2003, 2872, 2006, 2068, 1012, 1996, 27964, 5050, 1996, 2536, 3911, 1998, 8633, 1010, 2004, 1996, 9010, 1997, 3514, 2079, 1999, 1996, 3514, 1998, 7053, 4118, 1012, 1996, 1056, 16279, 2008, 2007, 2545, 2034, 7126, 2000, 8081, 1996, 3257, 1999, 2029, 1996, 11904, 2442, 2298, 2005, 1996, 3437, 2000, 2037, 17817, 1012, 2178, 4118, 1997, 4487, 17948, 3508, 2003, 2000, 2173, 2070, 5785, 5058, 1999, 1037, 7053, 1999, 1037, 2317, 1011, 14405, 2940, 1025, 2065, 1996, 16111, 2886, 1996, 5785, 3202, 1010, 2059, 21599, 2003, 2920, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9658879041671753, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "The same truth is evident in all the Santal\u2019s dealings with things that he cannot understand. The attitudes summed up in the terms \u201cmagic\u201d and \u201creligion\u201d are both in evidence. It is not usual in these days to distinguish sharply between them. 3 Cf. G. and M. Wilson, The Analysis of Social Change, Cambridge University Press, 1945, p. 72: \u201cMagic for us, though it may not postulate any transcendent reality, is an integral part of primitive religion.\u201d Magic is used by the Santal as a tool to accomplish many and varied ends. It is not absent from his dealings with the spirits, and it can be used for social as well as antisocial ends. It does consequently overlap the sphere of \u201creligion\u201d, which, however, covers experiences where the arts of magic do not reach, while magic also works independently in some situations. For the most part, the various approaches to the problems of living are simultaneously pursued, by individuals as well as by society. \u201cCharms\u201d are in almost universal use as a precaution against sickness; one finds the shell of a land tortoise hung in the cowshed to ward off smallpox, or cowrie shells worn as a protection against the evil eye, and amulets worn round the arm as a matter of routine and called ran, or medicine. A double attitude is most apparent in efforts to control the weather that plays so great a r\u00f4le in their life. In a period of great drought the Santals probably arrange for a special festival to be held, with sacrifices offered to the \u201cFive\u201d. At the same time they busy themselves in other ways which are quite independent of the sacrifice. Unmarried girls plaster the dancing floor with cowdung, while the married women do the same to their own courtyards. An investigation is made as to whether any woman has tied a rope on any roof. It is taboo for women to climb on roofs in the ordinary way, but some of the cowsheds and outbuildings have low roofs on which it would be possible to tie the straw to a rafter without climbing up. If it transpires that any woman has done so, she is made to climb up on to the roof and undo her work, first removing her clothing. Other investigations are made too. It may be that someone has stored dried matkom on the floor in her house instead of placing it on a plank or on stones; or it may be that oil has been stored in a sealed pot, in which case the covering must be removed. Underlying all these activities is the conviction that the welfare of society and of the individual depends on establishing a balance between man, nature and the spirit world, and they witness to a faith that such a balance is possible of achievement.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 2168, 3606, 2003, 10358, 1999, 2035, 1996, 4203, 2140, 1521, 1055, 24069, 2007, 2477, 2008, 2002, 3685, 3305, 1012, 1996, 13818, 7680, 7583, 2039, 1999, 1996, 3408, 1523, 3894, 1524, 1998, 1523, 4676, 1524, 2024, 2119, 1999, 3350, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2025, 5156, 1999, 2122, 2420, 2000, 10782, 9249, 2090, 2068, 1012, 1017, 12935, 1012, 1043, 1012, 1998, 1049, 1012, 4267, 1010, 1996, 4106, 1997, 2591, 2689, 1010, 4729, 2118, 2811, 1010, 3386, 1010, 1052, 1012, 5824, 1024, 1523, 3894, 2005, 2149, 1010, 2295, 2009, 2089, 2025, 2695, 9869, 2151, 9099, 23865, 4765, 4507, 1010, 2003, 2019, 9897, 2112, 1997, 10968, 4676, 1012, 1524, 3894, 2003, 2109, 2011, 1996, 4203, 2140, 2004, 1037, 6994, 2000, 14570, 2116, 1998, 9426, 4515, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2025, 9962, 2013, 2010, 24069, 2007, 1996, 8633, 1010, 1998, 2009, 2064, 2022, 2109, 2005, 2591, 2004, 2092, 2004, 3424, 6499, 13247, 4515, 1012, 2009, 2515, 8821, 17702, 1996, 10336, 1997, 1523, 4676, 1524, 1010, 2029, 1010, 2174, 1010, 4472, 6322, 2073, 1996, 2840, 1997, 3894, 2079, 2025, 3362, 1010, 2096, 3894, 2036, 2573, 9174, 1999, 2070, 8146, 1012, 2005, 1996, 2087, 2112, 1010, 1996, 2536, 8107, 2000, 1996, 3471, 1997, 2542, 2024, 7453, 9505, 1010, 2011, 3633, 2004, 2092, 2004, 2011, 2554, 1012, 1523, 24044, 1524, 2024, 1999, 2471, 5415, 2224, 2004, 1037, 3653, 3540, 13700, 2114, 15556, 1025, 2028, 4858, 1996, 5806, 1997, 1037, 2455, 17153, 3406, 5562, 5112, 1999, 1996, 17188, 9072, 2000, 4829, 2125, 25765, 1010, 2030, 11190, 7373, 10986, 6247, 2004, 1037, 3860, 2114, 1996, 4763, 3239, 1010, 1998, 25087, 2015, 6247, 2461, 1996, 2849, 2004, 1037, 3043, 1997, 9410, 1998, 2170, 2743, 1010, 2030, 4200, 1012, 1037, 3313, 7729, 2003, 2087, 6835, 1999, 4073, 2000, 2491, 1996, 4633, 2008, 3248, 2061, 2307, 1037, 2535, 1999, 2037, 2166, 1012, 1999, 1037, 2558, 1997, 2307, 14734, 1996, 4203, 4877, 2763, 13621, 2005, 1037, 2569, 2782, 2000, 2022, 2218, 1010, 2007, 18502, 3253, 2000, 1996, 1523, 2274, 1524, 1012, 2012, 1996, 2168, 2051, 2027, 5697, 3209, 1999, 2060, 3971, 2029, 2024, 3243, 2981, 1997, 1996, 8688, 1012, 17204, 3057, 15673, 1996, 5613, 2723, 2007, 11190, 27584, 2290, 1010, 2096, 1996, 2496, 2308, 2079, 1996, 2168, 2000, 2037, 2219, 10119, 2015, 1012, 2019, 4812, 2003, 2081, 2004, 2000, 3251, 2151, 2450, 2038, 5079, 1037, 8164, 2006, 2151, 4412, 1012, 2009, 2003, 27505, 2005, 2308, 2000, 7105, 2006, 15753, 1999, 1996, 6623, 2126, 1010, 2021, 2070, 1997, 1996, 17188, 9072, 2015, 1998, 2041, 25820, 2015, 2031, 2659, 15753, 2006, 2029, 2009, 2052, 2022, 2825, 2000, 5495, 1996, 13137, 2000, 1037, 21298, 2121, 2302, 8218, 2039, 1012, 2065, 2009, 9099, 20781, 2015, 2008, 2151, 2450, 2038, 2589, 2061, 1010, 2016, 2003, 2081, 2000, 7105, 2039, 2006, 2000, 1996, 4412, 1998, 25672, 2014, 2147, 1010, 2034, 9268, 2014, 5929, 1012, 2060, 9751, 2024, 2081, 2205, 1012, 2009, 2089, 2022, 2008, 2619, 2038, 8250, 9550, 13523, 3683, 2213, 2006, 1996, 2723, 1999, 2014, 2160, 2612, 1997, 6885, 2009, 2006, 1037, 24000, 2030, 2006, 6386, 1025, 2030, 2009, 2089, 2022, 2008, 3514, 2038, 2042, 8250, 1999, 1037, 10203, 8962, 102]}, {"score": 0.9188686013221741, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "The remaining festivals of the Santal year do not make the same stir throughout the countryside. Mokor is the name used in the area by Santals and non-Santals alike for the festival which takes place in mid-January. In some places it is called the Sakrat . At this time offerings are made to the ancestors in each house, and the celebration is accompanied by a display of stick dancing, which has replaced the former \u201csword and shield\u201d dance. At the end of the following month the Mag Sim, the hen at the end of the month of Mag, is offered. In former times the village officials used to resign at this time and could be either replaced or reappointed, but the only relic of the old practice that has survived is that the headman has to treat the whole village to beer. Contracts with servants are renewed during the festival, and they receive the cloth that is always a part of the contract. In connection with rice cultivation there is the Erok\u2019 Sim, the hen that is offered at the time of sowing, and N\u00e3w\u00e3i, when the first fruits of the first rice crop are offered in the sacred grove. Before this takes place the new rice must not be eaten. The village priest cuts the first handful of the crop and offers some at the foot of each of the chief trees. A sprig is also tied round the trunk of the trees and remains there. While the prayer is being said, milk is poured on the offering. After the priest has done his part, similar offerings are made in every house to the house spirits and the ancestors, the rice being taken from the crops belonging to the family. In varying degrees the Santals share in some of the festivals and practices of the low-caste cultivators around them. In the early monsoon days, during the period of Rohini, which is an auspicious time for sowing rice, they make a mark round their houses with cowdung as a protection against snakes. The snake goddess festival occurs in late August, and although its observance is not widespread among the Santals there are some local celebrations, especially when there is an ojha in the village. The ojhas all keep this festival, and others go to them at this time to ask for medicines against snakebite. Some Hindu festivals, as we have seen, furnish the occasion for large gatherings of Santals. At Sarenga, in addition to the Lakshmi Puja, a somewhat smaller gathering takes place during the hot weather in connection with the celebration of the Siva Gajon at a local temple. At this time the Charak, or hook-swinging festival, otherwise known as the Pata, takes place. The practice has almost died out within the last fifteen years. It had been prohibited by the government, but as long as the old generation, which was accustomed to the practice, remained it continued with gradually diminishing fervour. The Santals gather now to sing and to dance. They also join the throngs of pilgrims, sightseers and traders who collect at the Bogri mela, or fair, some thirty miles from Sarenga. This fair, which is one of the most famous in Western Bengal, takes place at the time of the Dol Jatra near a temple dedicated to Krishna. The last day of the mela is chiefly renowned for the fact that on that day there is a great concourse of Santals for dancing.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 3588, 7519, 1997, 1996, 4203, 2140, 2095, 2079, 2025, 2191, 1996, 2168, 16130, 2802, 1996, 10833, 1012, 9587, 21815, 2003, 1996, 2171, 2109, 1999, 1996, 2181, 2011, 4203, 4877, 1998, 2512, 1011, 4203, 4877, 11455, 2005, 1996, 2782, 2029, 3138, 2173, 1999, 3054, 1011, 2254, 1012, 1999, 2070, 3182, 2009, 2003, 2170, 1996, 7842, 22272, 2102, 1012, 2012, 2023, 2051, 14927, 2024, 2081, 2000, 1996, 10748, 1999, 2169, 2160, 1010, 1998, 1996, 7401, 2003, 5642, 2011, 1037, 4653, 1997, 6293, 5613, 1010, 2029, 2038, 2999, 1996, 2280, 1523, 4690, 1998, 6099, 1524, 3153, 1012, 2012, 1996, 2203, 1997, 1996, 2206, 3204, 1996, 23848, 21934, 1010, 1996, 21863, 2012, 1996, 2203, 1997, 1996, 3204, 1997, 23848, 1010, 2003, 3253, 1012, 1999, 2280, 2335, 1996, 2352, 4584, 2109, 2000, 12897, 2012, 2023, 2051, 1998, 2071, 2022, 2593, 2999, 2030, 2128, 29098, 25785, 2098, 1010, 2021, 1996, 2069, 24933, 1997, 1996, 2214, 3218, 2008, 2038, 5175, 2003, 2008, 1996, 2132, 2386, 2038, 2000, 7438, 1996, 2878, 2352, 2000, 5404, 1012, 8311, 2007, 8858, 2024, 9100, 2076, 1996, 2782, 1010, 1998, 2027, 4374, 1996, 8416, 2008, 2003, 2467, 1037, 2112, 1997, 1996, 3206, 1012, 1999, 4434, 2007, 5785, 13142, 2045, 2003, 1996, 9413, 6559, 1521, 21934, 1010, 1996, 21863, 2008, 2003, 3253, 2012, 1996, 2051, 1997, 2061, 9328, 1010, 1998, 6583, 21547, 1010, 2043, 1996, 2034, 10962, 1997, 1996, 2034, 5785, 10416, 2024, 3253, 1999, 1996, 6730, 7676, 1012, 2077, 2023, 3138, 2173, 1996, 2047, 5785, 2442, 2025, 2022, 8828, 1012, 1996, 2352, 5011, 7659, 1996, 2034, 9210, 1997, 1996, 10416, 1998, 4107, 2070, 2012, 1996, 3329, 1997, 2169, 1997, 1996, 2708, 3628, 1012, 1037, 11867, 3089, 2290, 2003, 2036, 5079, 2461, 1996, 8260, 1997, 1996, 3628, 1998, 3464, 2045, 1012, 2096, 1996, 7083, 2003, 2108, 2056, 1010, 6501, 2003, 8542, 2006, 1996, 5378, 1012, 2044, 1996, 5011, 2038, 2589, 2010, 2112, 1010, 2714, 14927, 2024, 2081, 1999, 2296, 2160, 2000, 1996, 2160, 8633, 1998, 1996, 10748, 1010, 1996, 5785, 2108, 2579, 2013, 1996, 8765, 7495, 2000, 1996, 2155, 1012, 1999, 9671, 5445, 1996, 4203, 4877, 3745, 1999, 2070, 1997, 1996, 7519, 1998, 6078, 1997, 1996, 2659, 1011, 14542, 8754, 11444, 6591, 2105, 2068, 1012, 1999, 1996, 2220, 19183, 2420, 1010, 2076, 1996, 2558, 1997, 20996, 20535, 1010, 2029, 2003, 2019, 17151, 24330, 6313, 2051, 2005, 2061, 9328, 5785, 1010, 2027, 2191, 1037, 2928, 2461, 2037, 3506, 2007, 11190, 27584, 2290, 2004, 1037, 3860, 2114, 12971, 1012, 1996, 7488, 7804, 2782, 5158, 1999, 2397, 2257, 1010, 1998, 2348, 2049, 27885, 8043, 21789, 2003, 2025, 6923, 2426, 1996, 4203, 4877, 2045, 2024, 2070, 2334, 12035, 1010, 2926, 2043, 2045, 2003, 2019, 1051, 3501, 3270, 1999, 1996, 2352, 1012, 1996, 1051, 3501, 14949, 2035, 2562, 2023, 2782, 1010, 1998, 2500, 2175, 2000, 2068, 2012, 2023, 2051, 2000, 3198, 2005, 20233, 2114, 7488, 16313, 2063, 1012, 2070, 7560, 7519, 1010, 2004, 2057, 2031, 2464, 1010, 6519, 24014, 1996, 6686, 2005, 2312, 21403, 1997, 4203, 4877, 1012, 2012, 18906, 13159, 2050, 1010, 1999, 2804, 2000, 1996, 21352, 16405, 3900, 1010, 1037, 5399, 3760, 7215, 3138, 2173, 2076, 102]}, {"score": 0.9628646969795227, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "The Santal pantheon includes about 150 deities, generally called BONGAS.

He boasts in front of the priest Sivalukukui that he would be the sun of all peoples ( salinga g\u00faatsi mama ), for he would protect against sickness to the ends of the directions with small offering stones. If any sickness were to come, he would close off the path of the sickness with a fence. But Sivalukukui denies that he could be the sun for all peoples ( 77 ). He could not be this, adds Trinidad Noivita in explanation, for he only attended to warding off sickness, not everything else, for instance, the harvest. According to the laws of sound change, Zug\u00ed corresponds to nugi, shell-lime, which is enjoyed with coca leaves. Sugi, the gourd container for the lime, is seemingly the same word. When H\u00eduika brought the shells ( nuksuzua ) ( 4 . The word nugi, lime, is in most of the designations for shells and snails. Cf. nuksei, nukuluva, nukuva . ) from the sea in order to burn them at home in the mountains, he let himself be led astray to sleep with them, for they were girls. -- Such forbidden cohabitation is, in the belief of the Kagaba, always the cause of sickness. -- The shells avenged themselves, and after they were burned, there began the fever heat which the white ( 5 . Or the red ones; cf. 6, 3 /omitted in the translation/. ) shells brought, while the green ones brought the chills of fever. \u201cSo H\u00eduika brought all kinds of sickness... Previously... one had begun to bar the path of sickness. But they went out and came in behind H\u00eduika, since they were human beings\u201d ( 6 , 3 ff.). Therefore, in usual fashion, the task of the Zug\u00ed mask, as demon of the burned shell-lime, is to influence the \u201cfever heat\u201d of the sicknesses brought into the mountains by the shells as a result of the burning. He is therefore also a kind of fire-demon. Now since one of the main tasks of the sun demons is 79 to ward off sickness approaching from the cardinal points, the Zug\u00ed mask wishes to do the same and to represent himself as \u201cthe sun of all peoples,\u201d whereupon Priest Sivalukukui rightly told him that he could not possibly be the sun for all peoples, clearly because he had only limited powers over sicknesses coming from the sea, quite apart from the other tasks of the sun.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1999, 2344, 2000, 2514, 2370, 2000, 2022, 1037, 4387, 1997, 1996, 3103, 1010, 1996, 5698, 16950, 5856, 1011, 7308, 1006, 16950, 5856, 25423, 11151, 1007, 2018, 2000, 2031, 1037, 2200, 4326, 3345, 1997, 2245, 1012, 2002, 21979, 1999, 2392, 1997, 1996, 5011, 9033, 10175, 6968, 6968, 10179, 2008, 2002, 2052, 2022, 1996, 3103, 1997, 2035, 7243, 1006, 16183, 28234, 19739, 11149, 2072, 9588, 1007, 1010, 2005, 2002, 2052, 4047, 2114, 15556, 2000, 1996, 4515, 1997, 1996, 7826, 2007, 2235, 5378, 6386, 1012, 2065, 2151, 15556, 2020, 2000, 2272, 1010, 2002, 2052, 2485, 2125, 1996, 4130, 1997, 1996, 15556, 2007, 1037, 8638, 1012, 2021, 9033, 10175, 6968, 6968, 10179, 23439, 2008, 2002, 2071, 2022, 1996, 3103, 2005, 2035, 7243, 1006, 6255, 1007, 1012, 2002, 2071, 2025, 2022, 2023, 1010, 9909, 11856, 2053, 12848, 6590, 1999, 7526, 1010, 2005, 2002, 2069, 3230, 2000, 4829, 2075, 2125, 15556, 1010, 2025, 2673, 2842, 1010, 2005, 6013, 1010, 1996, 11203, 1012, 2429, 2000, 1996, 4277, 1997, 2614, 2689, 1010, 16950, 5856, 14788, 2000, 16371, 5856, 1010, 5806, 1011, 14123, 1010, 2029, 2003, 5632, 2007, 16787, 3727, 1012, 10514, 5856, 1010, 1996, 2175, 3126, 2094, 11661, 2005, 1996, 14123, 1010, 2003, 9428, 1996, 2168, 2773, 1012, 2043, 7632, 10179, 2912, 2716, 1996, 10986, 1006, 16371, 5705, 17040, 6692, 1007, 1006, 1018, 1012, 1996, 2773, 16371, 5856, 1010, 14123, 1010, 2003, 1999, 2087, 1997, 1996, 26672, 2005, 10986, 1998, 13482, 1012, 12935, 1012, 16371, 5705, 7416, 1010, 16371, 5283, 7630, 3567, 1010, 16371, 5283, 3567, 1012, 1007, 2013, 1996, 2712, 1999, 2344, 2000, 6402, 2068, 2012, 2188, 1999, 1996, 4020, 1010, 2002, 2292, 2370, 2022, 2419, 2004, 28473, 2000, 3637, 2007, 2068, 1010, 2005, 2027, 2020, 3057, 1012, 1011, 1011, 2107, 10386, 2522, 25459, 18557, 2003, 1010, 1999, 1996, 6772, 1997, 1996, 10556, 3654, 3676, 1010, 2467, 1996, 3426, 1997, 15556, 1012, 1011, 1011, 1996, 10986, 24896, 2094, 3209, 1010, 1998, 2044, 2027, 2020, 5296, 1010, 2045, 2211, 1996, 9016, 3684, 2029, 1996, 2317, 1006, 1019, 1012, 2030, 1996, 2417, 3924, 1025, 12935, 1012, 1020, 1010, 1017, 1013, 16647, 1999, 1996, 5449, 1013, 1012, 1007, 10986, 2716, 1010, 2096, 1996, 2665, 3924, 2716, 1996, 10720, 2015, 1997, 9016, 1012, 1523, 2061, 7632, 10179, 2912, 2716, 2035, 7957, 1997, 15556, 1012, 1012, 1012, 3130, 1012, 1012, 1012, 2028, 2018, 5625, 2000, 3347, 1996, 4130, 1997, 15556, 1012, 2021, 2027, 2253, 2041, 1998, 2234, 1999, 2369, 7632, 10179, 2912, 1010, 2144, 2027, 2020, 2529, 9552, 1524, 1006, 1020, 1010, 1017, 21461, 1012, 1007, 1012, 3568, 1010, 1999, 5156, 4827, 1010, 1996, 4708, 1997, 1996, 16950, 5856, 7308, 1010, 2004, 5698, 1997, 1996, 5296, 5806, 1011, 14123, 1010, 2003, 2000, 3747, 1996, 1523, 9016, 3684, 1524, 1997, 1996, 15556, 2229, 2716, 2046, 1996, 4020, 2011, 1996, 10986, 2004, 1037, 2765, 1997, 1996, 5255, 1012, 2002, 2003, 3568, 2036, 1037, 2785, 1997, 2543, 1011, 5698, 1012, 2085, 2144, 2028, 1997, 1996, 2364, 8518, 1997, 1996, 3103, 7942, 2003, 6535, 2000, 4829, 2125, 15556, 8455, 2013, 1996, 7185, 2685, 1010, 1996, 16950, 5856, 7308, 8996, 2000, 2079, 1996, 2168, 1998, 2000, 5050, 102]}, {"score": 0.9663781523704529, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Those are all the demons relative to the sun. The remaining celestial bodies, for instance, saka (the moon) (or Namsaya) and Hindukana (the morning star), son of the sun and the moon, are admittedly mentioned as demonic creatures ( 3 ), but nothing is known about their activities or about masks. The stars ( zum\u00e9ia ) are not mentioned as independent beings either. Yet when planting banana shoots, one spits upon each plant \u201cso that the stars of the heavens may not see it and rot it.\u201d On the other hand there is a very instructive sickness and fire demon, Grandmother ( saka ) Suzauban, for whom nonetheless there does not seem to be a mask either. She is the rainbow ( zuzabanka ). Her name means a bifurcation, such as the tips of the rainbow represent, and in its essential parts appears, for example, in the words kaltsus\u00fa (forked stick), suzu\u00e9 (elbow), and nuksuzua (shell). Her rainbow form is also indicated in the narrative devoted to her ( 12, 3): \u201cGrand mother Suzauban had, and this was why she was called Suzauban, great claws half a span long (on her fingers), and on her forehead she had a broad horn a span long.\u201d In addition a characteristic trait of hers is that she is always swinging in a hammock ( 12 , 7 ff.), which is all the more striking since the K\u00e1gaba women never do this, but only the men. Her older and younger brothers are the sicknesses in human form ( mulbat\u00e1 k\u00e1gabakuei, 12, 14); she herself thus actually personifies sickness and as such is a fire creature. But just because of this, in the K\u00e1gaba mind, she is precisely the suitable person to destroy, to devour, sickness. She is entrusted with this task by the all-mother Gaute\u00f3van, the mother of fire. Since, however, she eats human beings instead of sicknesses, that is, when sickness destroys the people, she is killed by the younger brother Utsimata, cooked, and devoured by her brothers, the sicknesses, whom Utsimata invites to the feast, in the belief that it was some other meat.

The tubular beads at the chin of the mask correspond 81 to the tubular beads that were laid out as bait in a pot under the traps and, like the traps, were women themselves ( 10, 21 ff.). Obviously these were to tempt him to sexual excesses, which for the K\u00e1gaba count as the mystical causes of sickness and thus are closely bound up with a sickness-demon such as Kasindukua. It is probably also on account of this sickness-nature that a strange means is used to overcome him, pouring melted wax into his mouth, \u201cwhereupon all kinds of sicknesses, toothaches, and many (other) pains plagued him\u201d ( 10, 34). Therefore not only do sicknesses come from a sickness-demon; he personifies not only these themselves, but also the human beings plagued by the sicknesses ( 1 .

Without knowing the activity of this mask, one would have to assume, according to previous information, that here the dead or death-demon would be used in order to save people from death. To be sure, that is not given directly from the tasks of the mask, but from the remarkable name his\u00e9i huv\u00e9i for all kinds of the magical stone powder wrapped in maize leaves 2 . Ahuba = covering. , which is used for the most varied protective purposes, but especially as a means against sickness and to drive away death. A means against death is at the same time a means of death, just as a song against a demon is a song of the mask-demon concerned. Now the His\u00e9i mask is a demon who has to look after all the preparations for festivals, in particular the festive foods. Among these, moreover, the food for christenings is mentioned in particular ( 27, 2), which, like the complete act of christening, is intended for keeping the newborn child alive. Furthermore, the hut for the first cohabitation of newlywed couples is called his\u00e9i huv\u00e9i, like the stone powder in its wrapper, for here, as at the christening, it is used to preserve future life. And finally it is one of the foremost tasks at any festival to protect the dancers and the whole village from sickness. We must assume that the festive foods also serve this purpose more than would appear at first glance. A particular concern of the His\u00e9i mask is therefore a concern about the canchi fruit, which is used as festive food, to which there belongs a special two-day dance so that the fruit may not be eaten by animals. If one recalls the heavenly origin of this fruit and the detailed narrative about its spread across the land of the K\u00e1gaba ( 5, 23 ff.), one may deduce from that its importance as a festive food, and, to be sure, its importance for health, because it is the \u201cdeath mask\u201d which has assumed concern for it. Among other things the His\u00e9i mask says: \u201cSweep in front of the temple, sweep the rubbish together well, so that no puma and no snake may eat me, (for) I fear them\u201d ( 31, 5). That means, speaking from the developmental history of this demon: The sweeping in front of the temple 91 must be done so that no sickness may come, for the puma personifies these. And in connection with the snake, one can probably think immediately of the deadly bite of the poisonous snakes, which are quite common there. Since his mask with the snout-like jaw and the big teeth in it is supposed to represent the puma and on both sides it bears a carved snake (Ill. 31), this clearly expresses the fact that the snake is part of his character, just as sickness is. Since the all-mother herself attends to all ceremonies (p. 97), he comes here from her for the festival and then returns to her in his temple-mountain ( 31, 7). He lives with her, as does the priestly demon Muluku, who is related to him (p. 136). And just as the latter formerly lived on earth, the His\u00e9i mask was already taking care of the canchi fruit \u201cwhen he was still a man,\u201d that is, when he was still alive ( 27, 2). This mask too thus belongs among the activity-demons, as did the preceding beings, because it personifies the human means against sickness and death, but it no longer rests on nature.

Confession perhaps corresponds to the widespread idea of getting rid of a sickness through transference, which is also found among the K\u00e1gaba. On the way from the coast to Pueblo Viejo there is a place on this side of La Cueva where those who pass by, even the Colombians, throw leaves. It is the grave of Tum\u00fa . If someone, for instance, has a wound and throws there, say, a leaf which he had put on the wound, 96 then the dead man would devour the sickness. Likewise -- one must conclude -- the first step in ridding oneself of the evil consequences of a sin is to admit it openly, so that it will leave one.

They are able to do that by means of their various colors, which corresponded so closely to the appearance of certain nature-demons, e.g., the sun, fire, from which again, among other things, sicknesses also came forth and were obstructed.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 2353, 3412, 2965, 1997, 3670, 1010, 4661, 2299, 1998, 3153, 1010, 2003, 1996, 2962, 5378, 2030, 2962, 3894, 1010, 2083, 2029, 2028, 2064, 10655, 6855, 2393, 1998, 3860, 1999, 2116, 3971, 1010, 2021, 3391, 2114, 15556, 1998, 2331, 1012, 2129, 2023, 2038, 2042, 3369, 2012, 2064, 2190, 2022, 5319, 2013, 1996, 3670, 2010, 7416, 15876, 3567, 1006, 5266, 1997, 1996, 2757, 1007, 2005, 1996, 2962, 9898, 5058, 1999, 21154, 3727, 1012, 2054, 3310, 2013, 1996, 2757, 18227, 2114, 2331, 1998, 1996, 2757, 1010, 2074, 2004, 1996, 5698, 15806, 3747, 1996, 7942, 1012, 1998, 1996, 6386, 2031, 2116, 7264, 2000, 1996, 2757, 1012, 1996, 3418, 18921, 4783, 11650, 2020, 2320, 2962, 2111, 2030, 2904, 3209, 2046, 6386, 2044, 2331, 1010, 2061, 1996, 2210, 6386, 1998, 2962, 17530, 2109, 2005, 2023, 3262, 2272, 2059, 2013, 1996, 2214, 9729, 1997, 1996, 3023, 1010, 2013, 2029, 1996, 10556, 3654, 3676, 3209, 2131, 2068, 1010, 2065, 2027, 2079, 2025, 3383, 4965, 2068, 2013, 1996, 13598, 2015, 1012, 2026, 2878, 4425, 1997, 2122, 3894, 6386, 2234, 2013, 1996, 13598, 2015, 1025, 1996, 10556, 3654, 3676, 1010, 2174, 1010, 2018, 3563, 3415, 2005, 2035, 1997, 2068, 1010, 1998, 2005, 2068, 3209, 2037, 2219, 2020, 2025, 2005, 5096, 1012, 2633, 1010, 1996, 6386, 2020, 2036, 16405, 2863, 1011, 2066, 7329, 1998, 2004, 2107, 2716, 15556, 2229, 1006, 2156, 4903, 1012, 12606, 21461, 1012, 1007, 1012, 2021, 1996, 2210, 3894, 6386, 2071, 2079, 2172, 2062, 2084, 2074, 9526, 15556, 1998, 2507, 3860, 2013, 2009, 1012, 2027, 2024, 2583, 2000, 2079, 2008, 2011, 2965, 1997, 2037, 2536, 6087, 1010, 2029, 27601, 2061, 4876, 2000, 1996, 3311, 1997, 3056, 3267, 1011, 7942, 1010, 1041, 1012, 1043, 1012, 1010, 1996, 3103, 1010, 2543, 1010, 2013, 2029, 2153, 1010, 2426, 2060, 2477, 1010, 15556, 2229, 2036, 2234, 5743, 1998, 2020, 27885, 3367, 6820, 10985, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.5611528158187866, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "Since all the strength of the priests consists in taking into service the sun demon and even the passes with the little stones in part imply an imitation of the movement of the sun, e.g., to the four cardinal points, so also the activity of curing, protecting, and helping with stones is called mamalesi (literally, \u201cto become the sun\u201d). The stones used ( hagi ) are differentiated according to whether they are unbored or pierced, that is, beads as as\u00e9vakai (boys, that is, male) ( 1 . Sp. doncella /virgin/, because of their intactness. ) and p\u00e4uku\u00e9 (with hole, that is, female) ( 2 . Cf. also kuizi abunzi (female cane-flute with a hole) and sigi (male one with five holes). ), and accordingly, when it is a matter of using the whole stones for the well-being of either sex, the former are used for the male sex, the latter kind for the female sex. If the beads are oblong, they are called hul-a, -e ( 3 . Sp. tuma. ), and it is explicable also from the female 101 nature of these hula that they are women in the narrative about Kasindukua ( 10 , 21). The unbored stones, as\u00e9vakai , for the most part also show elaboration and likewise come from old graves of the coast. Usually the little stones are used pounded into a coarse powder. For this a small bit of the stone is sufficient; it is wrapped in maize leaves and later strewn in the air with the fingers, either in the vicinity of the persons or domestic animals to be protected or in the planting to be consecrated, upon the grave of the dead who is to be kept away, etc. The maize leaves, on the other hand, are thrown away or gathered together on large stones. One frequently finds these leaves in the vicinity of settlements or even on the stones along the way. With the little whole stone or with the little packet of crushed stone, the main part of the ceremony consists of passing it three times to the right and three times to the left around the head of the person or the domestic animal that is sick or that is to be protected, or one goes three times to the right and to the left around the house, village, or planting concerned. A separate packet is made for each particular kind of stone, even when several stones are used for one person, with the result that countless little packets are assembled for all the persons of a village. These are then tied together into a bundle in order to perform the ceremony with it. Every woman gives the priest as many maize leaves as there are persons in her household to be protected, and he makes the little packets. The powder is called his\u00e9i (dead man) or h\u00e1rvulu (little stone), and the packet is called his\u00e9i huv\u00e1 (covering of the dead), or \u00e1bukai , from musi (to beat someone, to beat the drum) and ibusi (to hurl, to throw), which occurs, for instance, in seibuk\u00e1 (the whizzer stick) ( 1 . Used only by boys. ), sibuk\u00e1 (the one spinning a thread). Abukai thus means \u201cthe little packet that throws, or scatters, the powder.\u201d To prepare the packet is called guasi, ikuasi , but this is also bound up with the things to be benefited, for instance, kualama guasi (to consecrate the field crops, actually to prepare the stone powder for the field crops). More general than \u00e1bukai or his\u00e9i huv\u00e1 is teiz\u00e1ua , which can also designate other kinds of magic remedies. More frequently such stone powder of any kind is hung in a little bag ( noamata ) in the temple for protection against any possible wrong and to further the general well-being. Four of them were hanging in the cansamaria of Chief Arregoc\u00e9 of San Miguel, one on each side of the two doors. The content is then called salingale , that is, all together, and the same name is also used if by way of exception several kinds of stone are joined together in one packet. In one song ( 94 ) the expression zukavaku is mentioned for the little bag of stones of the women, which probably stems from suka (tip, small) and bauku (female): the same as \u201cthe female small (stones).\u201d There it is said: \u201cSo sang Mother T\u00farliue to her little bag of stones and to the little bags of stones of all four women\u2019s lineages.\u201d This means that whoever represents Mother T\u00farliue , the source lake of the Rio Surivaka, sings so that her little bag of stones, as well as those of the four women\u2019s lineages to which the women of the settlement belong, may be efficacious for the field crops and other things.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2144, 2035, 1996, 3997, 1997, 1996, 8656, 3774, 1999, 2635, 2046, 2326, 1996, 3103, 5698, 1998, 2130, 1996, 5235, 2007, 1996, 2210, 6386, 1999, 2112, 19515, 2019, 20017, 1997, 1996, 2929, 1997, 1996, 3103, 1010, 1041, 1012, 1043, 1012, 1010, 2000, 1996, 2176, 7185, 2685, 1010, 2061, 2036, 1996, 4023, 1997, 12731, 4892, 1010, 8650, 1010, 1998, 5094, 2007, 6386, 2003, 2170, 9588, 4244, 2072, 1006, 6719, 1010, 1523, 2000, 2468, 1996, 3103, 1524, 1007, 1012, 1996, 6386, 2109, 1006, 5292, 5856, 1007, 2024, 24374, 2429, 2000, 3251, 2027, 2024, 4895, 12821, 2098, 2030, 16276, 1010, 2008, 2003, 1010, 17530, 2004, 2004, 13331, 11151, 1006, 3337, 1010, 2008, 2003, 1010, 3287, 1007, 1006, 1015, 1012, 11867, 1012, 2123, 29109, 2721, 1013, 6261, 1013, 1010, 2138, 1997, 2037, 10109, 2791, 1012, 1007, 1998, 29025, 5283, 2063, 1006, 2007, 4920, 1010, 2008, 2003, 1010, 2931, 1007, 1006, 1016, 1012, 12935, 1012, 2036, 13970, 10993, 2072, 8273, 14191, 2072, 1006, 2931, 11942, 1011, 8928, 2007, 1037, 4920, 1007, 1998, 9033, 5856, 1006, 3287, 2028, 2007, 2274, 8198, 1007, 1012, 1007, 1010, 1998, 11914, 1010, 2043, 2009, 2003, 1037, 3043, 1997, 2478, 1996, 2878, 6386, 2005, 1996, 2092, 1011, 2108, 1997, 2593, 3348, 1010, 1996, 2280, 2024, 2109, 2005, 1996, 3287, 3348, 1010, 1996, 3732, 2785, 2005, 1996, 2931, 3348, 1012, 2065, 1996, 17530, 2024, 27885, 10052, 1010, 2027, 2024, 2170, 15876, 2140, 1011, 1037, 1010, 1011, 1041, 1006, 1017, 1012, 11867, 1012, 10722, 2863, 1012, 1007, 1010, 1998, 2009, 2003, 4654, 24759, 5555, 3468, 2036, 2013, 1996, 2931, 7886, 3267, 1997, 2122, 15876, 2721, 2008, 2027, 2024, 2308, 1999, 1996, 7984, 2055, 10556, 11493, 28351, 6692, 1006, 2184, 1010, 2538, 1007, 1012, 1996, 4895, 12821, 2098, 6386, 1010, 2004, 13331, 11151, 1010, 2005, 1996, 2087, 2112, 2036, 2265, 3449, 7875, 21223, 1998, 10655, 2272, 2013, 2214, 9729, 1997, 1996, 3023, 1012, 2788, 1996, 2210, 6386, 2024, 2109, 13750, 2046, 1037, 20392, 9898, 1012, 2005, 2023, 1037, 2235, 2978, 1997, 1996, 2962, 2003, 7182, 1025, 2009, 2003, 5058, 1999, 21154, 3727, 1998, 2101, 25259, 1999, 1996, 2250, 2007, 1996, 3093, 1010, 2593, 1999, 1996, 9884, 1997, 1996, 5381, 2030, 4968, 4176, 2000, 2022, 5123, 2030, 1999, 1996, 14685, 2000, 2022, 12299, 1010, 2588, 1996, 6542, 1997, 1996, 2757, 2040, 2003, 2000, 2022, 2921, 2185, 1010, 4385, 1012, 1996, 21154, 3727, 1010, 2006, 1996, 2060, 2192, 1010, 2024, 6908, 2185, 2030, 5935, 2362, 2006, 2312, 6386, 1012, 2028, 4703, 4858, 2122, 3727, 1999, 1996, 9884, 1997, 7617, 2030, 2130, 2006, 1996, 6386, 2247, 1996, 2126, 1012, 2007, 1996, 2210, 2878, 2962, 2030, 2007, 1996, 2210, 14771, 1997, 10560, 2962, 1010, 1996, 2364, 2112, 1997, 1996, 5103, 3774, 1997, 4458, 2009, 2093, 2335, 2000, 1996, 2157, 1998, 2093, 2335, 2000, 1996, 2187, 2105, 1996, 2132, 1997, 1996, 2711, 2030, 1996, 4968, 4111, 2008, 2003, 5305, 2030, 2008, 2003, 2000, 2022, 5123, 1010, 2030, 2028, 3632, 2093, 2335, 2000, 1996, 2157, 1998, 2000, 1996, 2187, 2105, 1996, 2160, 1010, 2352, 1010, 2030, 14685, 4986, 1012, 1037, 3584, 14771, 2003, 2081, 2005, 2169, 3327, 2785, 1997, 2962, 1010, 102]}, {"score": 0.8136700391769409, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "102 There now follows an enumeration of the magic stones and their uses in alphabetical order ( 1 .

Unfortunately in the case of most of the stones the native designations cannot be translated. Nevertheless the basis for their effect comes out from the few which are understandable and in part also from the color. It is no different from what we have already observed in the case of the demons. The stones named with the word for sun ( mama, nui ), m\u00e1makuitsi, n\u00faikuitsi, mamaukue , are for dryness, against sun-buming, fire, or sickness (the heat of fever); the names of stones combined /104 cont./ with light, white ( su, mulkua ), sukuizi, s\u00famulu, sunni, mulkuakuitsi, are likewise related to protection against sickness, against fire, or to finding (the appearance) of cattle. The red stone-ax ( seiku\u00ed tsusi ) calls for dryness. Likewise, the light red sukuitsi is aimed at protection of the temple against fire and for the health of the dancers, the reddish aseihi no less than four times for protection against sickness, and for the same thing the dark red n\u00f3akuitsi . The reddish-yellow stone kuizakuitsi, from Kultsa (seed, has a strong sexual meaning and operates in connection with the first cohabitation, in connection with a girl\u2019s first menstruation, for the increase of cattle, and as a means of fertility for the newborn child at the christening ( gaul\u00ed ), just like the red stone ( gaulkuitsi ), which is also useful at the first menses. And this word gaul\u00ed is evidently found in a sexual sense in the name of the wedding hut, gaulhuv\u00e9, Furthermore the red n\u00f3akuitsi is suitable for the first cohabitation, just like the reddish aseihi, which also helps for the increase of the cattle. The red avikuitsi, from avi (blood), again is one of the efficacious stones in connection with a girl\u2019s first menstruation. So we see that with the color red, which in this case gets its efficacy from the female menstrual flow, is characterized the sexual act, but also protection against sickness, just as in the case of the red sun. The sickness demon Kasindukua, after all, also arose from the first menses of the all-mother.

All are called nuvakala, because there is dancing with the feather adornment of the birds ( nuva ), or kuiza (dance), while the church festivals are called pita, pitei, from the Spanish pitar (to pipe), or suziuan, from suz\u00fa (the stranger). The 110 March festival is to get from the sun protection against sickness for the coming rainy season and in addition a brief continuation of the dry season in order to finish the field work. It is therefore concerned exclusively with health, whereas that occurs only incidentally in connection with the two other festivals ( 40, 62, 77 ). In the September festival there is expressed the endeavor to call forth rain or to lessen its abundance, to moderate the winds, to keep all kinds of animals away from the crops, and in every way to care for the thriving of the crops. The December festival is concerned with the restoration of the dry season, with the harvest itself, and with all the tasks of the dry season, such as housebuilding and the making of pots. Common to all the festivals, besides the above-mentioned concern for health, are: at the beginning, songs for the birds whose feathers are worn at festivals ( 49 to 51 ); occasional songs for the animals who make up the festive foods ( 52 to 55, 63 ); at the end, songs for the eating of salt ( 29, 30, 64, 65 ), and after that the women\u2019s dances, which are almost exclusively directed against animals that pursue the chickens ( 1 . The fox song ( 42 )is also sung at the end. ) or damage the crops ( 68 to 74 ). Some of these, for instance, the dance of the lizard ( 75 ) and of the pasaroyo /Sp. pasarr\u00edos, \u201clizard, basilisk\u201d/ ( 76, are also performed at church festivals, but then without the feather adornment. At these feasts of the saints the women are said to dance in a circle, without holding on to one another, while one who has a little drum hanging down and beats it with two sticks moves in the middle.

Yet he wore no special clothing, only the rattle, like the four young novices. He kept a sharp eye on the precision of the dance and also danced himself with knees more deeply bent and more in time than did the novices, whose efforts in fact left much to be desired. A few times I was a witness as he struck one of them in punishment with the hard stick of the lime calabash. Priest Miguel Nolavita was also occasionally active.

For the aim was to perform the dances in the four directions, in order to prevent sicknesses from reaching the K\u00e1gaba from there ( 26 ). For this the dancers stood for a few minutes turned in each direction, beginning with the west then turning to the east, south, and north, both within and outside the temple. This demon was very fundamentally different from the other masks. His mask was completely black; a crack in the nose, covered with wax, was explained as the result of a quarrel between him and Grandmother Munkul\u00fa , with whom he had in his time pursued Seizankua (2, 9). A cap with the reddish feathers of the flamingo ( sinungela ) adorned the head. Like the His\u00e9i mask, instead of men\u2019s trousers and shirt, he wore the woman\u2019s garment ( zakua teima ), which formerly was the dress of both men and women, 115 except that in the dance both shoulders remain free, whereas among the women one shoulder is always covered. Around the hips he wore a colored woven belt with resounding snail shells at the back, just like the His\u00e9i mask, but, as something special, he had a little plaited penis in front and in the left hand the little basket and the club decorated with a snake scratched on it. He Iacked the palm-leaf apron ( huk\u00e1 ) which the His\u00e9i mask wears over the woman\u2019s dress, and he also did not have its white cloth hanging far down the back and the pointed collar over it (Ill. 34), and he was indisputably not as adorned with stone beads and golden bracelets as the His\u00e9i mask demon, so that the latter, who in relation to the Surl\u00ed mask was designated as younger brother and as subordinate to him, yet outwardly and in the whole course of the dance had some advantages over him. Although on the same day maize leaf packets were prepared with the four stones, aseihi, haktasi, n\u00f3akuitsi , and silvalukuitsi , for the health of the whole village and the powder was strewn in the air, the dances had nothing to do with this, according to the content of the accompanying songs ( 26 ). But in the similar case of the Great-sun mask ( Nuikukui uakai 62 ) the little packets, tied together, are carried by the dancers to all four directions, and in doing so they hold them in front of the mouth, with the thought that they are thus going to the ends of the horizon.

For the view of the K\u00e1gaba is that in cohabitation the male organ devours the secretion of the female. \u201cNow the member (kalgu\u00e1kala) of Matuna devoured (arz\u00e1) the sexual organ (hakulue) ( 2 . Literally: female hill = mound of Venus. ) of the wife of Songela \u201d runs the description of a cohabitation ( 11, 10). 121 But the general designation gazahi, gaitsahi (to practice cohabitation), expresses the process more clearly, for the literal translation says: to eat excrement, from gai, ga (excrement) and zahi (to eat). Cf. also gai-misi, ga-misi (to make excrement) and hu\u00edzi misi (to make urine). That is why the female sex organ is also called gaimisku\u00ed (that which makes excrement) or sot\u00e1 (= saut\u00e1 ) [the eating, the food]). Gahi and zahi (to eat), however, are synonomous words, so that gaul\u00ed = saul\u00ed is the male member, and gaul\u00ed g\u00fai, to make into a male member or to make procreative or fruitful. Thus one says of a christened K\u00e1gaba in a personal construction, gaul\u00ed agakuane (he is christened), or, in the contrary case, gauli agakuagele (he is not yet christened). Now it is also explicable that one of the five stones that are used for the newborn child is called guikuitsi (stone to make [procreative]) and that each of the other packets must be touched with the packet of powder from this stone.

Long hair hanging down is thus common to both. As early as nine to twelve years of age the boys receive from the father the lime container (sugi), with which the men occupy themselves at any time, but especially during their spare time, by wiping off the stick all around the upper edge of the container (cf. p. 39). The all-mother gaute\u00f3van gave the container as a spouse (seua), so that one might eat lime out of it from youth to old age (128) . Except for the singing of the appropriate song, however, no celebration takes place in connection with it. But narratives report on the procurement of the shells for it from the coast and on the sicknesses that arose from this ( 5, 5 ff., 6, 2 ff.). The partaking of lime is no remedy against sicknesses, however, as one might expect, or else the very superstitious K\u00e1gaba Silvestre and Trinidad would not have given up taking it. But it is important as a supplement to the 124 taking of coca, insofar as coca is used, along with the container ( tami ) of liquid tobacco ( no\u00e1i ), for the greeting. The one arriving does not give his hand, but hands to the other his tobacco container with the words hai tami (here is the container) or merely haiga (here), whereupon the latter puts his finger on the opening and lifts it to his mouth up to ten times, usually without the finger being moistened. The one greeted does the same with his container, and both mutually thrust a handful of coca leaves into each others hand or shoulder bag. At the most one might first ask h\u00e1ntsiga itei? (is it going well?), whereupon the one greeted likewise repli\u00e8s manki h\u00e1ntsiga? (with you [is it going] well too?). At departure one only says nei or neiniguk\u00fa (I am going). The exchange of coca and tobacco juice has a binding force for friendly feeling, for from the fact that the novice hands him these two things Kas\u00edndukua recognizes his good intentions and the warnings of his sister in regard to this novice as lies ( 10, 15 f.). Two songs are also devoted to the preparation of the tobacco juice, one of which says that one must die if one does not sing ( 107 . 119 ). It is thus a very dangerous pleasure. There is also a narrative about the bringing of coca by the deer Bunku\u00e9i, the daughter of Gaute\u00f3van (cf. p. 99), which fits in with the custom that only the women may pick the coca leaves, whereas the men undertake the seeding and transplanting of the young bushes.

After the punishment the good-for-nothings were also sent into exile to Surivaka to the priest Felix Daza, until they had improved. In more recent times they were put in the cepo /Sp. \u201cstocks\u201d/. The punishment of putting a bar both over and under the legs and tying together the projecting ends ( cepo huvu ) is also to be traced back to Spanish influence. For the woman there was only one kind of punishment: to sit for about two hours on a pointed stone ( harsukale, from hagi [stone] and asuka [pointed]), which was considered a severe punishment. Since this measure was not used for men, it doubtless came about through consideration of the meaning of gai, ga, excrement, as secretion from the anus and, on the other hand, from the genital organs during cohabitation, and it is shown by this kind of punishment 129 that it was supposed to be not only a physical torment, but a magical influence on the suppression of sexual offenses or the consequences proceeding from them, such as sickness, etc., just as the fasting of the men and the interruption at midnight, as at the festivities, are already to be thought of as a magico-religious influence of the same kind. Now I believe that the pointed stick ( husukala ) at the tip of the womens\u2019 huts is to be explained as a symbol of the harsukale, the stone used in the punishment.

In this position he is put in a hammock, which is hung on a pole, and carried to the grave-yard in the vicinity of the village. The relatives follow, in part weeping, but not shrieking. The round grave is approximately one and a half meters deep. The deceased in placed in this with his face toward the south, toward the snow-capped mountain Takind\u00fae -- as I was told -- to which the soul goes. The hammock is taken back again. Even today s\u00eaveral things are still given to the deceased in the grave, but now there is no longer any rule governing this. Priest Miguel says that his father Narciso gave his golden festival adornment to a friend to keep during a trip, but the latter\u2019s son later said that he had put the things in the grave with his father, who had died in the meantime, which was believed and respected. The place of the grave can also still be distinguished later. Merely the 131 later strewing of stone powder and planting of stone beads calls for that. But for the uninitiated no distinguishing marks are present. Some said that one laid a stone slab on it. And in fact in the cemetery of Noavaka, as my boy Telesforo Gutierrez reported to me, there were two of the characteristic stone installations which one also finds elsewhere in the land of the K\u00e1gaba, especially in the neighborhood of the temples. and which to the uninformed look like stone seats, since they consist of a thin slab of stone lying on the ground and another set upright against it like the back of a chair. Moreover three and two of these respectively stand in a row in front of the door of the two temples in Nabuvakai (Ill. 36), one behind the temple of the Kasiki\u00e1l, others near the temple in Noavaka. They are called hakukt\u00fa (stone slab), also haksinkana, perhaps from sinika (striped, striped stone), and were also in these cases explained as seats of the priests. On the other hand, the row of stones close to Takina on the north consisted of similar stone-installations, which were explained as field crops (of. p. 105). Still others about ten minutes above and below Takina on the way to Makotama and San Miguel were explained as helpers ( h\u00e1\u00f1guakukui ) of the temple of Takina, which are supposed to inform the priest of the arrival of sicknesses and other dangers. There were none in the region of Palomino, only one stone installation in the valley of the Rio Kavikongui not far from Santa Rosa, and seven more below Noavaka, in addition to those already listed from there previously. That is also why my informants from Palomino were unable to say anything about them. /The remainder of the text, pp. 132-414, is omitted in the translation.

Of course, the word \u201cdevil\u201d does not exist in their language, but heis\u00e9i -- dead person or death -- is always translated in this way, since it is the force opposed to the principle of the good, of life. Heis\u00e9i ( 3 . The etymology of the word is unknown to us. Preuss writes: his\u00e9i . ) is spoken of as a collectivity, just as sometimes \u201cthe Mother\u201d and \u201cthe Mothers\u201d are confused; and this concept includes all the dead, that is to say, all of the ancestors of the tribe who are not expressly designated as immortals such as the Fathers, Mothers, or Masters. Heis\u00e9i is a man, and they imagine him with \u201cthe face of a tigre.\u201d In fact, the mask which represents him has a long muzzle and great projecting teeth, and during the dance which is performed with it the movements and growls of this wild animal are imitated. Heis\u00e9i is the Master of Sickness and it is he who sends it to earth to punish those persons who have committed offenses or who have been negligent about the rites and offerings. Just like the Mother, Heis\u00e9i is omnipresent, but his symbols are male symbols: the snake, the arrow, the crab ( 4 . The crab is a \u201cworm.\u201d The big blue crabs of the coast are called heis\u00e9i husso -- crab of death. ). The mast of Heis\u00e9i shows a snake coiled around the face. The color of Death is blue, and the sky is blue because \u201cthe dead live there\u201d ( 5 . It is not always very clear where the dead live, in the sky or in the snow. Cf. \u201cReligion, The Beyond.\u201d ). Archeological sites are places where \u201cDeath lives\u201d ( 6 . Cf. \u201cEconomy, the System of Horticulture\u201d /see 1: Reichel-Dolmatoff in this file/. Ancient osseous remains are called heis\u00e9inita . ), and archeological objects are \u201cthings of the dead,\u201d and therefore full of contagion and sickness. Such objects must be reburied or handed over to the M\u00e1ma . Heis\u00e9i has a marked sexual character ( 7 . Perhaps the name heis\u00e9i is related to s\u00e9 sei -- penis. ) and controls the sexual life, especially of the men. 91 In fact, he is sometimes designated as Father of Homosexuality. The Kogi believe that there is almost no place on the surface of the earth where there has not been cohabitation some time, that is to say, where human beings who today are heis\u00e9i have not cohabited. The earth is imagined to be literally impregnated with the sperm of the dead, and contact between this and the sperm of the living \u201copens a door\u201d through which sickness may enter the land. If a person performs the sexual act again in one place, Heis\u00e9i \u201cwill do harm\u201d to the sexuality of the man, will send sicknesses to him, and will cause the death of the children. These sites are designated as \u201ctraps\u201d (kat\u00fa) into which the sperm falls; and above all graveyards or places where it is believed that dead persons are buried are called this ( 8 . Compare with this concept of \u201ctrap\u201d the uterine symbolism which burial has. Cf. \u201cLife Cycle; Death and Burial.\u201d ). Since the land itself is a female element and symbolizes the Mother, coitus on this land always implies the danger of incest, and Heis\u00e9i is closely related to the incestuous instinct. The ritual of coitus is considered essentially a means of defense to counteract the malign influence of Heis\u00e9i and to avoid this incest.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1523, 1996, 6548, 2003, 2331, 1524, 1025, 1523, 2044, 2331, 2057, 2024, 2035, 13664, 1524, 1025, 1523, 15556, 2229, 2024, 1996, 2757, 1012, 1524, 2122, 2093, 15672, 1997, 1996, 12849, 5856, 2265, 2200, 4415, 2054, 1996, 4145, 1997, 2002, 5562, 2072, 1010, 2331, 1010, 2965, 2000, 2068, 1012, 1997, 2607, 1010, 1996, 2773, 1523, 6548, 1524, 2515, 2025, 4839, 1999, 2037, 2653, 1010, 2021, 2002, 5562, 2072, 1011, 1011, 2757, 2711, 2030, 2331, 1011, 1011, 2003, 2467, 5421, 1999, 2023, 2126, 1010, 2144, 2009, 2003, 1996, 2486, 4941, 2000, 1996, 6958, 1997, 1996, 2204, 1010, 1997, 2166, 1012, 2002, 5562, 2072, 1006, 1017, 1012, 1996, 26803, 1997, 1996, 2773, 2003, 4242, 2000, 2149, 1012, 3653, 17854, 7009, 1024, 2010, 7416, 1012, 1007, 2003, 5287, 1997, 2004, 1037, 8145, 7730, 1010, 2074, 2004, 2823, 1523, 1996, 2388, 1524, 1998, 1523, 1996, 10756, 1524, 2024, 5457, 1025, 1998, 2023, 4145, 2950, 2035, 1996, 2757, 1010, 2008, 2003, 2000, 2360, 1010, 2035, 1997, 1996, 10748, 1997, 1996, 5917, 2040, 2024, 2025, 4671, 2135, 4351, 2004, 26796, 2107, 2004, 1996, 11397, 1010, 10756, 1010, 2030, 5972, 1012, 2002, 5562, 2072, 2003, 1037, 2158, 1010, 1998, 2027, 5674, 2032, 2007, 1523, 1996, 2227, 1997, 1037, 14841, 17603, 1012, 1524, 1999, 2755, 1010, 1996, 7308, 2029, 5836, 2032, 2038, 1037, 2146, 17750, 1998, 2307, 18398, 4091, 1010, 1998, 2076, 1996, 3153, 2029, 2003, 2864, 2007, 2009, 1996, 5750, 1998, 27825, 1997, 2023, 3748, 4111, 2024, 10047, 15198, 1012, 2002, 5562, 2072, 2003, 1996, 3040, 1997, 15556, 1998, 2009, 2003, 2002, 2040, 10255, 2009, 2000, 3011, 2000, 16385, 2216, 5381, 2040, 2031, 5462, 25173, 2030, 2040, 2031, 2042, 11265, 25394, 11461, 2055, 1996, 17105, 1998, 14927, 1012, 2074, 2066, 1996, 2388, 1010, 2002, 5562, 2072, 2003, 18168, 3490, 28994, 4765, 1010, 2021, 2010, 9255, 2024, 3287, 9255, 1024, 1996, 7488, 1010, 1996, 8612, 1010, 1996, 18081, 1006, 1018, 1012, 1996, 18081, 2003, 1037, 1523, 15485, 1012, 1524, 1996, 2502, 2630, 26076, 1997, 1996, 3023, 2024, 2170, 2002, 5562, 2072, 15876, 24137, 1011, 1011, 18081, 1997, 2331, 1012, 1007, 1012, 1996, 15429, 1997, 2002, 5562, 2072, 3065, 1037, 7488, 24599, 2105, 1996, 2227, 1012, 1996, 3609, 1997, 2331, 2003, 2630, 1010, 1998, 1996, 3712, 2003, 2630, 2138, 1523, 1996, 2757, 2444, 2045, 1524, 1006, 1019, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2025, 2467, 2200, 3154, 2073, 1996, 2757, 2444, 1010, 1999, 1996, 3712, 2030, 1999, 1996, 4586, 1012, 12935, 1012, 1523, 4676, 1010, 1996, 3458, 1012, 1524, 1007, 1012, 23005, 4573, 2024, 3182, 2073, 1523, 2331, 3268, 1524, 1006, 1020, 1012, 12935, 1012, 1523, 4610, 1010, 1996, 2291, 1997, 7570, 28228, 14561, 1524, 1013, 2156, 1015, 1024, 14365, 2884, 1011, 2079, 19145, 3406, 4246, 1999, 2023, 5371, 1013, 1012, 3418, 9808, 3366, 3560, 3464, 2024, 2170, 2002, 5562, 5498, 2696, 1012, 1007, 1010, 1998, 23005, 5200, 2024, 1523, 2477, 1997, 1996, 2757, 1010, 1524, 1998, 3568, 2440, 1997, 9530, 15900, 3258, 1998, 15556, 1012, 2107, 5200, 2442, 2022, 2128, 8569, 11998, 2030, 4375, 2058, 2000, 1996, 9588, 1012, 2002, 5562, 2072, 2038, 1037, 4417, 4424, 2839, 1006, 1021, 1012, 3383, 1996, 102]}, {"score": 0.9196045398712158, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Occasional offerings are made in innumerable places along roads where the genii loci live, where there is a cave, a rock of extraordinary shape, or a spring of water.

Once the day for the beginning of the ceremony has been determined by divination, the whole town is cleaned, and the road which leads from it to the nearby stream or river, where those attending will take their ritual baths, is repaired. Then the M\u00e1ma lights a fire in the ceremonial house by means of a drill, afterwards feeding the flames with certain woods which have been brought exclusively for this purpose. 142 In the meantime the fire is extinguished in all of the houses and is then lighted again with embers which each man brings from the ceremonial house to his dwelling. In the afternoon the M\u00e1ma and his assistants, as well as the men of status who will take an active part in the dance, leave the town and go to a nearby house, to the one belonging to the M\u00e1ma or to one belonging to some Elder, where the masks and other ritual objects have been deposited beforehand. There they put on the costumes, ornaments, and masks, and at nightfall they come back to the town. Some men play large gourd trumpets announcing the arrival of the masks, but otherwise the participants proceed silently in single file. Upon arriving in the town, they then pass through its plaza and all enter the ceremonial house, walking first toward the east, then toward the west, south, and north, respectively, all with short steps, the knees bent, and making bows toward the \u201cfour corners of the world.\u201d Meanwhile only the trumpets are played. This entrance of the masks is interpreted as a ceremonial greeting. Halting in the middle of the house, the masks pronounce the ritual greetings and commence a song accompanied by a slow dance, during which the dancers scarcely move from their places, but only rock the body from side to side or abruptly move the head from side to side. In the accompanying song the masks say that they were sent by the Universal Mother to visit the Kogi and to see if \u201call is in accord.\u201d They ask if there are food and firewood, if all have confessed and fasted, and if the town has been cleaned. After a short time the participants remove the masks and place them on large tripods of stakes, which have been placed along the walls in the interior of the ceremonial house for this purpose. Then the gathering sits down on little benches and hammocks, and periods of conversation, singing and dancing performed by individuals and more of the nature of practicing, follow. Occasionally the M\u00e1ma intervenes and directs the dancing, inviting all of the men to participate in it. They go on dancing this way through the night, sometimes with the masks, sometimes without them. Now maracas, trumpets, drums, and flutes accompany the songs, and the dancers stop facing in this direction, perhaps just turning their faces and maracas to this side. Thus \u201cthe masks speak with the directions\u201d and \u201ckeep the bad at a distance and bring the good.\u201d At the same time the M\u00e1ma receives from the 143 men, dancers or observers, the bundles of mineral dust, opens them, and blows their contents toward the four directions. Many times the men themselves do this and the M\u00e1ma does not personally intervene. According to the time of year or the special object of the ceremony, they next repeat certain dances and songs, say, the dance of Kandj\u00ed, the dance of Nams\u00edku, the dance of the rain, or the many dances which are performed in order to \u201cbe in accord\u201d with the animals which damage the crops. In the festivals of the solstices and equinoxes, the next day is devoted to the dance of the mask of Surl\u00ed or the one of Nuikuk\u00fai (the Master of the East). At dawn the tripods with the masks are placed outside the ceremonial house with the faces turned toward the east \u201cto greet the sun.\u201d In the afternoon, or sometimes even in the morning, the mask of Surl\u00ed dances outside or inside the ceremonial house, his dance being accompanied by songs and the sound of the trumpets. At night the masks are brought in again, and the dances and songs continue until dawn, together with the offerings of mineral powder. In the free hours, however, the men devote themselves to small household tasks, eat from time to time, or toast coca leaves in the ceremonial house. No matter what the immediate object of the ceremony may be, whether \u201cto turn the sun around\u201d or \u201cto arrange a rain-shower\u201d (that is to say, to make it rain), the prime concern is always to keep sicknesses away. In the songs they speak of \u201cmaking fences on the roads of sickness\u201d or of \u201cclosing the doors to sickness,\u201d and on occasion the dancers manipulate a small broom of leaves in each hand for the purpose of \u201csweeping away sickness\u201d and \u201ccleaning the pueblo.\u201d", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2057, 4618, 2085, 2156, 2129, 2122, 3296, 10912, 1997, 1996, 11278, 1997, 1996, 15806, 2024, 2864, 1012, 2320, 1996, 2154, 2005, 1996, 2927, 1997, 1996, 5103, 2038, 2042, 4340, 2011, 4487, 17948, 3508, 1010, 1996, 2878, 2237, 2003, 12176, 1010, 1998, 1996, 2346, 2029, 5260, 2013, 2009, 2000, 1996, 3518, 5460, 2030, 2314, 1010, 2073, 2216, 7052, 2097, 2202, 2037, 8887, 19692, 1010, 2003, 13671, 1012, 2059, 1996, 9588, 4597, 1037, 2543, 1999, 1996, 12961, 2160, 2011, 2965, 1997, 1037, 12913, 1010, 5728, 8521, 1996, 7311, 2007, 3056, 5249, 2029, 2031, 2042, 2716, 7580, 2005, 2023, 3800, 1012, 16087, 1999, 1996, 12507, 1996, 2543, 2003, 27705, 1999, 2035, 1997, 1996, 3506, 1998, 2003, 2059, 26390, 2153, 2007, 7861, 17198, 2029, 2169, 2158, 7545, 2013, 1996, 12961, 2160, 2000, 2010, 13160, 1012, 1999, 1996, 5027, 1996, 9588, 1998, 2010, 16838, 1010, 2004, 2092, 2004, 1996, 2273, 1997, 3570, 2040, 2097, 2202, 2019, 3161, 2112, 1999, 1996, 3153, 1010, 2681, 1996, 2237, 1998, 2175, 2000, 1037, 3518, 2160, 1010, 2000, 1996, 2028, 7495, 2000, 1996, 9588, 2030, 2000, 2028, 7495, 2000, 2070, 6422, 1010, 2073, 1996, 15806, 1998, 2060, 8887, 5200, 2031, 2042, 14140, 25828, 1012, 2045, 2027, 2404, 2006, 1996, 12703, 1010, 24005, 1010, 1998, 15806, 1010, 1998, 2012, 28018, 2027, 2272, 2067, 2000, 1996, 2237, 1012, 2070, 2273, 2377, 2312, 2175, 3126, 2094, 26506, 13856, 1996, 5508, 1997, 1996, 15806, 1010, 2021, 4728, 1996, 6818, 10838, 8601, 1999, 2309, 5371, 1012, 2588, 7194, 1999, 1996, 2237, 1010, 2027, 2059, 3413, 2083, 2049, 8232, 1998, 2035, 4607, 1996, 12961, 2160, 1010, 3788, 2034, 2646, 1996, 2264, 1010, 2059, 2646, 1996, 2225, 1010, 2148, 1010, 1998, 2167, 1010, 4414, 1010, 2035, 2007, 2460, 4084, 1010, 1996, 5042, 6260, 1010, 1998, 2437, 21207, 2646, 1996, 1523, 2176, 8413, 1997, 1996, 2088, 1012, 1524, 5564, 2069, 1996, 26506, 2024, 2209, 1012, 2023, 4211, 1997, 1996, 15806, 2003, 10009, 2004, 1037, 12961, 14806, 1012, 9190, 2075, 1999, 1996, 2690, 1997, 1996, 2160, 1010, 1996, 15806, 4013, 3630, 17457, 1996, 8887, 14806, 2015, 1998, 22825, 1037, 2299, 5642, 2011, 1037, 4030, 3153, 1010, 2076, 2029, 1996, 10487, 20071, 2693, 2013, 2037, 3182, 1010, 2021, 2069, 2600, 1996, 2303, 2013, 2217, 2000, 2217, 2030, 9225, 2693, 1996, 2132, 2013, 2217, 2000, 2217, 1012, 1999, 1996, 10860, 2299, 1996, 15806, 2360, 2008, 2027, 2020, 2741, 2011, 1996, 5415, 2388, 2000, 3942, 1996, 12849, 5856, 1998, 2000, 2156, 2065, 1523, 2035, 2003, 1999, 15802, 1012, 1524, 2027, 3198, 2065, 2045, 2024, 2833, 1998, 2543, 3702, 1010, 2065, 2035, 2031, 14312, 1998, 3435, 2098, 1010, 1998, 2065, 1996, 2237, 2038, 2042, 12176, 1012, 2044, 1037, 2460, 2051, 1996, 6818, 6366, 1996, 15806, 1998, 2173, 2068, 2006, 2312, 4440, 20620, 1997, 7533, 1010, 2029, 2031, 2042, 2872, 2247, 1996, 3681, 1999, 1996, 4592, 1997, 1996, 12961, 2160, 2005, 2023, 3800, 1012, 2059, 1996, 7215, 7719, 2091, 2006, 2210, 19571, 1998, 10654, 5302, 10603, 1010, 1998, 6993, 1997, 4512, 1010, 4823, 1998, 5613, 2864, 2011, 3633, 1998, 2062, 1997, 1996, 3267, 1997, 12560, 1010, 3582, 1012, 5681, 1996, 9588, 18793, 2015, 1998, 102]}, {"score": 0.8181720972061157, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "In speaking of the collective ceremonies, we have already said that they have as one of their principal objects the driving out of \u201csickness\u201d and keeping it away from the town.

Alternating at first between the breast and small quantities of masticated food, the former is withdrawn more and more. But as a general rule the process is not so easy and is almost never managed without a violent protest from the babies, who cry, shriek, and kick in order to gain access to the breast. The mothers then frequently try to explain to the baby, by estures and words, that they ought not to nurse in the presence of other people \u201cbecause the breast is very obscene.\u201d By taking the breast abruptly away from him when another person enters, and making appropriate gestures and indications of embarrassment, disgust, and displeasure, the mother thus shows the baby that this is now a matter of a prohibited and secret act of which society does not approve. Thus a baby finally is allowed to nurse only on the very rare occasions when the mother is alone with him. If the baby nevertheless insists and rejects larger quantities of solid food, the father, the mother, or any other adult present tries to frighten him with threats: \u201cIf you continue nursing, the snakes will come. If you go on nursing, the toad will eat you.\u201d The next step is the most effective one: the mother rubs her nipples with pepper ( 8 . Capsicum . ), lemon, or any other substance which has a bitter taste. With this, nursing ends completely. The babies react with fits of anger, and many times with violent vomiting, which, as we shall see below, is repeated still later as a sign of protest. If the mother should become pregnant while she is nursing a baby, the latter is always weaned one or two months before the birth, since it is said that otherwise the baby would get sick, and in these cases the pepper or lemon method is always used. Nonetheless, it does occur that after this period and after the delivery, both the first baby and the newborn child nurse simultaneously, although the first one 191 might have been weaned already and fed only solid food. If the mother of a baby should become sick during the period of nursing, the child is immediately weaned, since it is said that the baby can catch the sickness from his mother\u2019s milk. If the baby becomes sick, he is likewise immediately weaned, generally causing his death. The first food given to a baby during the process of weaning and following this is panela water or malanga soup, a broth of ripe platano or of uncooked platano, or pieces of cooked potato. It is always his mother herself who gives him this food, first putting it into the mouth of the baby with her fingers and later using a small spoon made out of a totuma /fruit of the calabash tree/. Older sisters of the baby are never entrusted with this task, and other adult women only very rarely.

In 1930 an epidemic of measles claimed about 60 victims among children and adolescents on the western slope, and another one of smallpox broke out in 1948 in the same zone and similarly affected the entire tribe, since it was spread by the Indians who fled to the northern slopes.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2348, 1996, 12849, 5856, 3227, 2444, 2012, 2062, 2084, 1015, 1010, 2199, 5563, 2682, 2712, 2504, 1998, 2037, 6552, 2003, 2740, 3993, 1998, 2489, 1997, 1996, 28935, 18389, 1997, 1996, 5133, 4224, 2029, 20626, 1996, 2918, 1997, 1996, 24875, 1010, 2027, 2031, 2019, 16903, 3571, 1997, 24757, 1010, 1998, 2122, 2024, 1037, 5377, 3395, 1997, 4512, 1998, 1997, 3412, 4023, 1012, 2000, 2022, 2469, 1010, 1996, 5573, 3431, 1997, 4860, 1010, 14710, 8738, 1010, 25519, 3107, 2011, 1523, 10585, 1010, 1524, 1998, 1996, 2236, 6438, 1997, 8474, 1997, 19548, 3426, 1996, 2307, 3484, 1997, 1996, 12849, 5856, 2000, 9015, 2013, 4937, 2906, 25032, 1010, 11888, 22953, 12680, 13706, 1010, 2030, 20014, 19126, 9932, 13728, 11187, 3303, 2011, 2572, 8913, 3676, 2063, 2030, 16253, 1012, 2053, 3056, 2553, 1997, 15877, 2001, 5159, 1010, 1998, 6660, 2053, 2310, 3678, 15879, 7870, 1012, 16311, 2015, 1997, 25765, 1998, 2033, 3022, 4244, 3107, 2011, 1996, 8581, 15526, 2030, 2011, 6505, 2040, 2031, 6158, 2648, 1997, 2037, 8807, 3700, 2024, 6976, 1998, 1013, 2795, 3544, 2182, 1013, 3429, 2012, 2335, 3426, 2995, 22156, 1012, 1999, 4849, 2019, 16311, 1997, 25765, 3631, 2041, 1999, 2624, 15614, 1998, 3659, 5901, 2802, 1996, 4224, 4548, 2011, 1996, 5917, 1012, 1999, 4479, 2019, 16311, 1997, 2033, 3022, 4244, 3555, 2055, 3438, 5694, 2426, 2336, 1998, 25947, 2006, 1996, 2530, 9663, 1010, 1998, 2178, 2028, 1997, 25765, 3631, 2041, 1999, 3882, 1999, 1996, 2168, 4224, 1998, 6660, 5360, 1996, 2972, 5917, 1010, 2144, 2009, 2001, 3659, 2011, 1996, 6505, 2040, 6783, 2000, 1996, 2642, 10314, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.8935806155204773, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "The personal ornaments are limited to necklaces, which are used exclusively by the women and girls. These necklaces are made with beads of stones of archeological origin, or sometimes European ones, and small red glass beads which are inserted between aluminum medals, safety pins, buttons, or small beads made of dried seeds. The archeological necklaces consist of tubular, globular, or discoidal stones of quartz in different colors. Sometimes the stones are combined with gold or copper objects likewise of archeological origin. These necklaces, which are passed down from mother to daughter, represent a great value among the K\u00f3gi, since the archeological stones play an important role in the tribal religion (cf. \u201cReligion\u201d /see 2: Reichel-Dolmatoff in this file/). The little girls receive small strings of beads. All the K\u00f3gi, men, women; and children of both sexes, wear on both wrists a single or double cotton cord with two or three round black seeds. This, however, is not a matter of an ornament properly speaking, but rather of amulets which protect the wearer against illness (cf. below: \u201cReligion\u201d /see 2: Reichel-Dolmatoff in this file/). Combs made of sticks of macana /a palm/ are sometimes used, but the K\u00f3gi assert that they are made only by the Sank\u00e1.

The lack of economic collaboration is severely punished in the following situations: husband-wife, parents-children, sons-in-law -- fathers-in-law, but it is considered a minor offense when other combinations between persons or families are involved. Lies or defamations are generally regarded as examples of diplomacy and justified caution, but are not offenses properly speaking. Unadapted individuals, or those who conduct themselves in an unusual or extravagant manner in the culture, are not considered as offenders, but are fully responsible in case of a direct infraction. Malevolent magic does not exist as an aggressive action. Offenses against property are always interpreted in terms of food and are punished severely whenever it is a question of thefts of foodstuffs, fruits, or domestic animals. Thefts of utilitarian objects occur frequently, but are considered of less importance. The principal political offense is treason. An individual may be accused of treason if he maintains friendly contacts with strangers who are not natives and communicates religious knowledge to them or takes them to sacred sites or gives them ceremonial objects. In these cases they may go as far as capital punishment. Sexual offenses include masturbation, prenuptial sexuality, adultery, incest, homosexuality, contacts with animals, and obscene language. Coitus must be done in 146 certain places, intervals, and positions; and certain personal rites must be observed in relation with it. Religious offenses, finally, include innumerable actions, and ultimately every offense, no matter what it is, is interpreted in religious terms, especially if it is a matter of negligence in offerings and personal rites, in rites of purification, fasts, diet, and sexual abstinence. The concept of immunity does not exist for any person. Suicide is considered a social and religious offense, since the individual is thus trying to escape from his responsibilities. Offenses are brought to public knowledge through direct accusation by the person offended, occasionally assisted by members of his family, without their necessarily being affected by the offense. Public opinion can similarly exercise sufficient pressure to bring a collective accusation before the authority. Another means of ascertainment would be the confession of the delinquent, which in serious cases may obligatorily be repeated in public. The Kogi do not only consider evident acts as offenses, but also thoughts and intentions. Thinking about adultery is as serious as the consummated act, and the individual who thought about stealing a yuca is as guilty as if he had in fact stolen it. These thoughts, like all offenses, must be confessed periodically to the m\u00e1ma, and, in order that this confession be truthful and detailed, he has the backing of supernatural punishment with illnesses. The K\u00f3gi have a great fear of sickness and death and are concerned daily about possible pathological symptoms. Thus confession is really an extremely efficient means of control, since the eventual punishment will not be carried out in some remote beyond, but immediately. After having fasted, spent the night awake, and confessed for hours, the individual, very understandably, will feel a headache. This ache is immediately interpreted as a punishment for not having confessed well, and the same individual will go back again to the m\u00e1ma to repeat his confession and to scrutinize his mind, trying to remember the slightast offenses, in order to communicate them to the m\u00e1ma and thus free himself of all evil.

In the first place, offerings must be made to them, and the fulfillment of this requirement depends on whether the relationship is friendly or not. Once the offerings have been made, an individual has nothing to fear and the animal will defend him against illness or misfortune but if he does not make the offerings, the animal will punish him, sending calamities upon him. An individual has control over his totem, to put it one way, as long as he fulfills his obligation to the ancestor, but he is controlled by it when the ancestor sees himself abandoned by his descendant. Dances and songs which imitate these animals and which are performed in order to ask for aid from them are strictly the \u201cproperty\u201d of the individuals who descend from an ancestral animal, which implies also, naturally, the ownership of masks and other ceremonial objects. In no case should the animal be killed or eaten, and concerning animals possibly dangerous to man, it is said that they 189 will never attack an individual of their \u201cfamily.\u201d The selecting of these animals is not in keeping with their economic value, but rather is related to the particular sexual symbol of each one, which we shall discuss later.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2057, 2323, 1999, 1996, 2034, 2173, 21032, 2182, 2090, 10722, 2595, 2063, 1006, 2030, 4830, 3489, 1007, 1998, 1523, 2155, 1524, 1999, 1996, 2000, 18532, 2594, 3168, 1012, 2000, 1996, 3160, 1523, 7632, 10722, 2595, 2063, 1029, 1524, 1006, 2054, 2003, 2115, 10722, 2595, 2063, 1029, 1007, 1010, 1037, 2158, 2097, 3437, 1010, 1523, 6583, 10722, 2595, 2063, 13970, 11140, 2050, 1011, 10722, 2595, 2063, 1524, 1006, 2026, 10722, 2595, 2063, 2003, 1996, 13970, 11140, 2050, 1011, 10722, 2595, 2063, 1007, 1010, 2021, 2000, 1996, 3160, 1010, 1523, 7632, 2624, 2050, 1029, 1524, 1006, 2054, 2003, 2115, 2155, 1029, 1007, 1010, 2002, 2097, 6869, 1010, 1523, 6583, 2624, 2050, 5003, 25509, 2226, 1524, 1006, 2026, 1523, 2155, 1524, 2003, 1996, 4419, 1013, 1062, 29459, 1013, 1007, 1012, 1996, 2171, 1523, 10722, 2595, 2063, 1524, 2182, 2965, 1996, 1523, 3428, 1010, 1524, 2030, 1996, 10748, 1998, 8481, 1997, 1037, 3327, 2158, 1025, 1523, 2624, 2050, 1010, 1524, 1999, 5688, 1010, 2003, 2182, 1996, 1523, 7117, 1524, 1006, 2004, 2028, 28694, 2056, 1007, 1998, 2003, 4198, 12158, 3973, 2007, 2624, 1011, 1011, 2132, 1010, 7367, 1011, 1011, 19085, 1012, 2035, 1996, 10722, 2595, 2063, 2030, 4830, 3489, 6807, 1037, 1523, 7117, 1524, 1998, 13520, 3209, 3141, 2000, 1037, 3056, 4111, 1010, 3269, 1010, 4874, 1010, 2030, 3019, 9575, 1012, 2023, 3276, 2003, 4703, 4541, 1999, 27866, 3408, 1024, 1523, 1045, 2572, 2365, 1997, 1996, 4419, 1013, 1062, 29459, 1013, 1010, 1524, 1523, 1996, 14841, 17603, 1013, 16490, 1013, 2003, 2026, 2269, 1010, 1524, 1523, 1996, 7488, 2003, 2026, 3920, 2905, 1010, 1524, 1523, 2256, 2269, 2003, 1996, 16405, 2863, 1010, 1524, 1523, 1045, 2031, 1996, 2668, 1997, 1996, 14841, 17603, 1010, 1524, 1523, 2057, 2020, 2035, 3839, 2141, 2013, 4176, 1012, 1524, 2122, 4176, 2024, 3495, 5240, 2004, 10748, 1024, 1523, 2057, 2035, 2234, 2013, 4176, 1012, 2027, 2020, 2320, 2111, 1012, 1524, 1996, 3276, 1997, 1996, 2177, 1998, 1997, 1996, 3265, 2007, 2023, 4111, 2003, 3674, 1012, 1999, 1996, 2034, 2173, 1010, 14927, 2442, 2022, 2081, 2000, 2068, 1010, 1998, 1996, 29362, 1997, 2023, 9095, 9041, 2006, 3251, 1996, 3276, 2003, 5379, 2030, 2025, 1012, 2320, 1996, 14927, 2031, 2042, 2081, 1010, 2019, 3265, 2038, 2498, 2000, 3571, 1998, 1996, 4111, 2097, 6985, 2032, 2114, 7355, 2030, 28616, 13028, 9816, 2021, 2065, 2002, 2515, 2025, 2191, 1996, 14927, 1010, 1996, 4111, 2097, 16385, 2032, 1010, 6016, 10250, 10631, 7368, 2588, 2032, 1012, 2019, 3265, 2038, 2491, 2058, 2010, 2000, 18532, 1010, 2000, 2404, 2009, 2028, 2126, 1010, 2004, 2146, 2004, 2002, 13883, 2015, 2010, 14987, 2000, 1996, 13032, 1010, 2021, 2002, 2003, 4758, 2011, 2009, 2043, 1996, 13032, 5927, 2370, 4704, 2011, 2010, 12608, 1012, 11278, 1998, 2774, 2029, 10047, 17570, 2122, 4176, 1998, 2029, 2024, 2864, 1999, 2344, 2000, 3198, 2005, 4681, 2013, 2068, 2024, 9975, 1996, 1523, 3200, 1524, 1997, 1996, 3633, 2040, 18855, 2013, 2019, 14947, 4111, 1010, 2029, 12748, 2036, 1010, 8100, 1010, 1996, 6095, 1997, 15806, 1998, 2060, 12961, 5200, 1012, 1999, 2053, 2553, 2323, 1996, 4111, 2022, 2730, 2030, 8828, 1010, 1998, 7175, 4176, 4298, 102]}, {"score": 0.9592757225036621, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "The K\u00f3gi, of course, recognize that a given animal will preferentially eat a certain diet and will never eat anything that might harm him. It seems that a good part of the tensions which at present characterize the marital situation is due to such considerations. Frequently, under present conditions, an individual marries any woman, regardless of her D\u00e1ke, and generally both parties are ignorant of the details of the T\u00faxe system, knowing only that they belong to a certain totem. Although the M\u00e1ma sometimes disapproves of such a marriage, he allows it; and thus frequently an individual marries a woman who, according to the ancient rules, is not suitable for him. If then any misfortune occurs in the family, such as illness, bad crops, or infant mortality, the M\u00e1ma is the first to blame the husband and to tell him 191 that the misfortune occurred because he married a prohibited woman. When the man thus realizes that his \u201cfood\u201d was not suitable for him and that, as a jaguar, he had \u201ceaten\u201d a snake, he thus immediately rationalizes the illness, infant mortality, or the loss of fertility of his cultivated lands in terms of a dangerous indigestion which threw his marriage completely out of balance and exposed it to very severe supernatural punishments. Let it be said that, in all the complex functioning of the T\u00faxe and D\u00e1ke, the totemic idea is the one that has been most strongly maintained among the K\u00f3gi, and in any marriage both parties know very well to what totems they belong, although they may know nothing else about additional rules, origins, or attributes.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 12849, 5856, 1010, 1997, 2607, 1010, 6807, 2008, 1037, 2445, 4111, 2097, 9544, 24271, 2135, 4521, 1037, 3056, 8738, 1998, 2097, 2196, 4521, 2505, 2008, 2453, 7386, 2032, 1012, 2009, 3849, 2008, 1037, 2204, 2112, 1997, 1996, 13136, 2029, 2012, 2556, 2839, 4697, 1996, 23143, 3663, 2003, 2349, 2000, 2107, 16852, 1012, 4703, 1010, 2104, 2556, 3785, 1010, 2019, 3265, 19941, 2151, 2450, 1010, 7539, 1997, 2014, 4830, 3489, 1010, 1998, 3227, 2119, 4243, 2024, 21591, 1997, 1996, 4751, 1997, 1996, 10722, 2595, 2063, 2291, 1010, 4209, 2069, 2008, 2027, 7141, 2000, 1037, 3056, 2000, 18532, 1012, 2348, 1996, 9588, 2823, 4487, 3736, 9397, 17597, 2015, 1997, 2107, 1037, 3510, 1010, 2002, 4473, 2009, 1025, 1998, 2947, 4703, 2019, 3265, 19941, 1037, 2450, 2040, 1010, 2429, 2000, 1996, 3418, 3513, 1010, 2003, 2025, 7218, 2005, 2032, 1012, 2065, 2059, 2151, 28616, 13028, 9816, 5158, 1999, 1996, 2155, 1010, 2107, 2004, 7355, 1010, 2919, 8765, 1010, 2030, 10527, 13356, 1010, 1996, 9588, 2003, 1996, 2034, 2000, 7499, 1996, 3129, 1998, 2000, 2425, 2032, 19871, 2008, 1996, 28616, 13028, 9816, 4158, 2138, 2002, 2496, 1037, 10890, 2450, 1012, 2043, 1996, 2158, 2947, 10919, 2008, 2010, 1523, 2833, 1524, 2001, 2025, 7218, 2005, 2032, 1998, 2008, 1010, 2004, 1037, 16490, 1010, 2002, 2018, 1523, 8828, 1524, 1037, 7488, 1010, 2002, 2947, 3202, 11581, 10057, 1996, 7355, 1010, 10527, 13356, 1010, 2030, 1996, 3279, 1997, 17376, 1997, 2010, 13237, 4915, 1999, 3408, 1997, 1037, 4795, 27427, 25538, 16643, 2239, 2029, 4711, 2010, 3510, 3294, 2041, 1997, 5703, 1998, 6086, 2009, 2000, 2200, 5729, 11189, 29115, 1012, 2292, 2009, 2022, 2056, 2008, 1010, 1999, 2035, 1996, 3375, 12285, 1997, 1996, 10722, 2595, 2063, 1998, 4830, 3489, 1010, 1996, 2000, 18532, 2594, 2801, 2003, 1996, 2028, 2008, 2038, 2042, 2087, 6118, 5224, 2426, 1996, 12849, 5856, 1010, 1998, 1999, 2151, 3510, 2119, 4243, 2113, 2200, 2092, 2000, 2054, 2000, 18532, 2015, 2027, 7141, 1010, 2348, 2027, 2089, 2113, 2498, 2842, 2055, 3176, 3513, 1010, 7321, 1010, 2030, 12332, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9677618145942688, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "With these same directions are associated the winds, and with these in turn definite colors and attributes, which are also associated with rain showers ( 1 .

At the end of the World, showers of all colors will fall, and then they will be visible.\u201d ). The wind from the East is white and good; the wind from the West is black and bad; the wind from the North is blue and bad, and the wind from the South is red and may be good or bad. These winds are imagined as women wearing long skirts, who come dancing from the four directions where they have their homes, each bringing certain gifts. Thus the wind from the East \u201cbrings good,\u201d the wind from the West \u201cbrings evil,\u201d the wind from the North \u201cbrings sickness,\u201d and the wind from the South \u201cbrings the heat.\u201d These qualities, the good, the bad, sickness, and heat, are thought of as substances, and, in fact, it is said that these substances cling to the clothing of the four women and spread from them like \u201cseeds.\u201d The winds thus have the character of fertilizing forces in a benign and malignant sense. There are many mythical examples which express this concept. Thus, for example, B\u00fankua-se blows on Kashind\u00fakua, when the latter falls unconscious, and makes him revive; then he blows upon the bones of Kashind\u00fakua and again resuscitates him. Tamis\u00e9i blows upon the bones of Sekuishb\u00fachi and revives them; the breeze blows on Dugin\u00e1vi, the solar hero, when he comes forth, unconscious, from the sea monster and brings him to life. In the myth concerning the creation of the first man, it is said of the Universal Mother: Blowing, she gave him life.\u201d But this same blowing can also be a defensive action: Sangaram\u00e9na blows into the eye of his enemy Mat\u00fana and converts him into a blue ball; the m\u00e1ma who protected N\u00e1maku blows against the attacking enemies and transforms them into fruits of the field, which N\u00e1maku eats ( 1 .

The lime powder which is mixed with the 252 coca is similarly blown into the air in order to attract rain ( 2 . Cf. \u201cReligion,\u201d offerings. ). All sickness is regarded as having been brought by the winds, and it is especially the humid wind from the sea, the \u201cblue wind,\u201d which is considered the most dangerous of all. The association of the directions with good or bad events is similarly expressed in various myths. In the creation myth it is said that the \u201cEnd of the World\u201d lies beyond the Magdalena River, in the West. Aldauhu\u00edku, a culture hero, came from the East. In the West lived the evil Ubat\u00e1shi and other mythical tribes who were considered to be endowed with evil magical powers.

Any of the personifications of the religion, the Fathers, Mothers, Masters or Heis\u00e9i (Death), can send these evils, which then come with the winds, principally with the \u201cblue wind.\u201d For this reason sickness itself is designated as \u201can ill wind,\u201d a substance like a \u201cseed\u201d which impregnates a person and which, after a brief period of incubation, appears with its symptoms.

Several lengthy myths tell of how the four sons of the Mother-Goddess created Mount Doananku\u00edvi, at the headwaters of the Tucurinca River and, inside the mountain, built the first ceremonial house where novices were to be trained for the priesthood. The first legendary m\u00e1ma to teach such a group of disciples was B\u00fanalyue, and once they had acquired the status of priests, they settled in the nearby valley of Muku\u00e1nauiaishi which, thereafter, became the center for the training of novices from all over the Sierra Nevada.

B\u00fankuas\u00e9, \u201cthe shining one,\u201d is the personification of the highest moral principles in Kogi ethics and is thus taken to be the patron and spiritual guardian of the priesthood.

But occasionally, and much to his brother\u2019s grief, he misused his powers and then did great harm to people.

Divinatory techniques are many and consist of simple yes-or-no alternatives, but often take the form of complex interpretations of signs and symbols, such as the reading of cloud formations, animal voices, or the shape and number of air bubbles rising from a tubular necklace bead which has been submerged in water. Other mechanisms are muscle twitching, deep meditation, and the listening to sudden sounds or voices from within. Divination is practised mainly to ascertain whether or not a certain action is fesible. The decision may concern the planting of a crop, the clearing of a field, or any aspect of a wide range of major or minor alternatives of resource management, housing, family affairs, travel, trade, or other activities. People must continually consult these priestly oracles in order to have their actions guided by divination; should they disregard these rules, symptoms of illness will soon come to express the displeasure of the divine forces and the priests will impose penalties which, occasionally, can be very harsh. Priestly divination undoubtedly introduces a random element (Moore, 1965) but much of it appears to be manipulated and the final decision most often represents a personal choice made by the priest. This is almost always the case in matters of mate selection; in agricultural and general subsistence decision making, divination is an effective device in ecological planning because the priest\u2019s practical environmental knowledge is truly outstanding. Priestly divinations provide guidance not only for small-scale decisions in daily life but may determine major strategies such as the foundation or relocation of settlements, the intensification of a certain crop, or the nature of trade relationships with neighbouring creole settlers. The effectiveness of this, to a large degree, ritually controlled agro-ecosystem (Rappaport, 1969) is recognized by most Kogi Indians. In fact, the underlying reason why Kogi culture has been able to resist harmful change, is that it gives a strong backing to priestly authority.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 4054, 3451, 7337, 2005, 2151, 3171, 1010, 2591, 1010, 2030, 3412, 4023, 2003, 5011, 2135, 4487, 17948, 3508, 1012, 4487, 17948, 7062, 5461, 2024, 2116, 1998, 8676, 1997, 3722, 2748, 1011, 2030, 1011, 2053, 15955, 1010, 2021, 2411, 2202, 1996, 2433, 1997, 3375, 15931, 1997, 5751, 1998, 9255, 1010, 2107, 2004, 1996, 3752, 1997, 6112, 13197, 1010, 4111, 5755, 1010, 2030, 1996, 4338, 1998, 2193, 1997, 2250, 17255, 4803, 2013, 1037, 25147, 13016, 26892, 2094, 2029, 2038, 2042, 13563, 1999, 2300, 1012, 2060, 10595, 2024, 6740, 25402, 1010, 2784, 13804, 1010, 1998, 1996, 5962, 2000, 5573, 4165, 2030, 5755, 2013, 2306, 1012, 4487, 17948, 3508, 2003, 20439, 3701, 2000, 2004, 17119, 18249, 3251, 2030, 2025, 1037, 3056, 2895, 2003, 10768, 19307, 1012, 1996, 3247, 2089, 5142, 1996, 14685, 1997, 1037, 10416, 1010, 1996, 8430, 1997, 1037, 2492, 1010, 2030, 2151, 7814, 1997, 1037, 2898, 2846, 1997, 2350, 2030, 3576, 15955, 1997, 7692, 2968, 1010, 3847, 1010, 2155, 3821, 1010, 3604, 1010, 3119, 1010, 2030, 2060, 3450, 1012, 2111, 2442, 14678, 23363, 2122, 5011, 2135, 14721, 2015, 1999, 2344, 2000, 2031, 2037, 4506, 8546, 2011, 4487, 17948, 3508, 1025, 2323, 2027, 27770, 2122, 3513, 1010, 8030, 1997, 7355, 2097, 2574, 2272, 2000, 4671, 1996, 28606, 1997, 1996, 7746, 2749, 1998, 1996, 8656, 2097, 17607, 12408, 2029, 1010, 5681, 1010, 2064, 2022, 2200, 8401, 1012, 5011, 2135, 4487, 17948, 3508, 17319, 13999, 1037, 6721, 5783, 1006, 5405, 1010, 3551, 1007, 2021, 2172, 1997, 2009, 3544, 2000, 2022, 20063, 1998, 1996, 2345, 3247, 2087, 2411, 5836, 1037, 3167, 3601, 2081, 2011, 1996, 5011, 1012, 2023, 2003, 2471, 2467, 1996, 2553, 1999, 5609, 1997, 6775, 4989, 1025, 1999, 4910, 1998, 2236, 27667, 3247, 2437, 1010, 4487, 17948, 3508, 2003, 2019, 4621, 5080, 1999, 12231, 4041, 2138, 1996, 5011, 1521, 1055, 6742, 4483, 3716, 2003, 5621, 5151, 1012, 5011, 2135, 4487, 17948, 9285, 3073, 8606, 2025, 2069, 2005, 2235, 1011, 4094, 6567, 1999, 3679, 2166, 2021, 2089, 5646, 2350, 9942, 2107, 2004, 1996, 3192, 2030, 18344, 1997, 7617, 1010, 1996, 20014, 6132, 9031, 1997, 1037, 3056, 10416, 1010, 2030, 1996, 3267, 1997, 3119, 6550, 2007, 9632, 21414, 7322, 1012, 1996, 12353, 1997, 2023, 1010, 2000, 1037, 2312, 3014, 1010, 8887, 2135, 4758, 12943, 3217, 1011, 16927, 1006, 9680, 4502, 6442, 1010, 3440, 1007, 2003, 3858, 2011, 2087, 12849, 5856, 6505, 1012, 1999, 2755, 1010, 1996, 10318, 3114, 2339, 12849, 5856, 3226, 2038, 2042, 2583, 2000, 9507, 17631, 2689, 1010, 2003, 2008, 2009, 3957, 1037, 2844, 5150, 2000, 5011, 2135, 3691, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9502501487731934, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "In his introduction to the Murie books, Parks has cited information from the unpublished works of Dorsey and Murie relating to the use of incense during ceremonies.

This god did not like the odor of sweetgrass: it was sweet and he liked the odor of only unclean things.

Reprinted in facsimile, Athens, Ohio: Ohio University Press, 1974), pp. 76-77. According to Garland Blaine, Each Pawnee battle group consisted of ten to twenty men spaced about ten feet apart. Each group was distinctively dressed with the insignia of its society, such as a lance with different feathers fastened to the shaft. Body paint was of different colors, and members of the same society did not necessarily wear the same color or design. Some wore white streaks all over the body. Others had the left side of the face painted blue and the right side red. Different designs resulted from vision quest experiences or dreams. These special designs were unique to an individual and were worn by him to any event. 248 . Blaine, unpublished notes. In major encounters before \u201ctreaty times\u201d a band or village chief assumed leadership. Mounted on his horse he chose a good vantage point apart from his warriors where he could observe and direct the action. His scouts brought him notice of the location of the enemy or where they were coming from. This was relayed to the groups of warriors in their society groupings. He was particularly watchful of any flanking movement attempted by the enemy, and warning of this would be sent to the warriors. Within each of the groups, such as the Iruska, one great warrior might lead its movements, but each man according to circumstances, could act independently in a fluid rapid encounter where men horses, cries and dust might obscure the leaders\u2019 commands or other sign communication with the warriors. One man, or perhaps, more, might say, \u201cThis is a good day to die.\u201d If so, this man was carefully painted and dressed in his best. In case of death, then, no one would have to dress the body. If a man stripped off everything, that could also mean he intended to win or die. When he did this he took off his breech cloth which was about three to four feet long and six to eight inches wide. He tied it around his head with the ends hanging to the side or back. Otherwise, if worn in battle it would bind and chaff, especially when riding a horse, where in quick maneuvers it could hinder the rider. Another reason for removing clothing in battle was that if a warrior was shot there would be no cloth to enter the wound. Wounds with cloth in them went bad even with the best medical attention our Pawnee doctors gave them.\u201d 249 .

Later, after the potato ( Solunum tuberosum ) had been introduced into North America, readers of these early writings erroneously construed them to refer to the potato. Hence arose the myth of potatoes having been grown by Indians of Virginia. Peter Kalm, a Swedish botanist, in his visit to North America, mentions the common use of these tubers by the colonists of New Sweden (New Jersey) as they had learned from their Indian neighbors. When the French Jesuit missionaries saw the Indians in New France (Quebec) harvesting these wild tubers they noticed their characteristic growth in long strings like a string of beads, hence they called them les racines des chapelets, \u201crosary roots.\u201d When the potato ( Solanum tuberosum ) was first introduced to the people of the Dakota Nation, they compared them to the tubers of Apios, which was one of their important native food plants. The Dakota name of Apios, which is bio, was applied to the potato, and finally was completely transferred to it, so that now in common Dakota use the word blo signifies potato. No. 7. A number of seeds of the Bush Summer Squash ( Cucurbita pepo of the melopepo type). This type of cucurbit was of coextensive distribution with corn in the aboriginal agriculture of North America. In later prehistoric and historic cultures, many tribes possessed Cucurbita maxima (Winter Squash), Cucurbita pepo (Pumpkin) and Cucurbita pepo melopepo (Summer Squash), but in earlier prehistoric cultures Cucurbita maxima and C. pepo might be lacking, [while] it appears that C. pepo melopepo was not lacking in any cultures which possessed corn and beans. No. 8. A small quantity of seeds of a chenopodiaceous plant, apparently Chenopodium sp. But these seeds are much larger than the seeds of any native Chenopodium of that region. The seeds of most species of chenopodiaceous plants indigenous in the region are 1 mm or less in diameter, but these are 3 mm in diameter. In the Journal of the Washington Academy of Science, volume VIII, no. 15, September 1918, W. E. Safford describes under the title \u201cChenopodium nuttaliae, a Food Plant of the Aztecs\u201d, a chenopodium which is cultivated in Mexico as a food grain. The seeds of our specimen more nearly agree with this description and illustrations of Chenopodium nutalliae Safford, sp. nov., than with the seeds of any chenopodiaceous plant now growing in the region where these specimens were found. The puzzling and interesting question arises: How came these seeds here? Were they cultivated by the Pawnees at that time? Were they of direct importation from Mexico? It is well known that the Pawnee made expeditions into Mexico in historic time, well on into the nineteenth century. Did they bring seeds of cultivated plants thence, and was this Aztec crop plant introduced by Pawnee farmers into their farming operations in Nebraska? White men who traveled among the Pawnee have mentioned their cultivated crops, but only corn, beans, squashes, and pumpkins, those already familiar to these white men in their own homes. It may well be that here was another crop unknown to these white men and unnoticed by them. Even cultivated sunflowers, common as they were to Pawnee agriculture, were scarcely mentioned or not mentioned at all in accounts by these white men. Another crop, still less known to white men, might easily have escaped notice entirely. If they saw fields of it growing, they probably, not being acquainted with it, considered them to be old neglected fields \u201cgone to weeds.\u201d", "predicted_label": 0, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 3143, 3189, 2006, 13194, 9908, 2013, 1996, 2940, 2609, 1010, 2004, 4453, 2011, 2852, 1012, 22999, 1010, 2003, 2004, 4076, 1024, 2053, 1012, 1015, 1012, 2274, 2235, 4109, 1997, 1996, 7117, 1997, 21909, 11610, 13682, 3775, 21710, 1006, 7570, 10606, 10732, 2050, 13682, 3775, 21710, 1007, 1012, 1996, 7117, 1997, 2023, 2001, 2200, 3811, 19593, 2098, 2011, 1996, 19175, 4402, 1998, 2060, 6946, 2306, 2049, 2846, 1010, 2005, 3365, 20632, 3594, 1010, 2926, 2004, 1037, 19519, 2005, 1996, 6805, 1997, 23114, 2015, 2532, 9681, 1012, 2053, 1012, 1016, 1012, 2176, 14496, 1997, 3748, 22088, 1006, 10975, 4609, 2271, 25988, 1007, 1012, 1996, 3748, 22088, 2001, 3811, 11126, 2005, 2833, 2224, 1010, 1998, 2001, 8828, 1999, 6196, 12450, 4840, 1998, 4895, 3597, 23461, 1010, 1998, 2001, 12984, 2005, 12901, 1012, 2009, 2001, 2036, 6560, 2005, 3467, 2224, 2011, 17462, 1012, 2053, 1012, 1017, 1012, 2416, 29030, 17588, 1997, 13493, 9781, 1012, 2053, 1012, 1018, 1012, 1037, 2193, 1997, 14496, 1997, 20578, 9766, 1006, 8292, 7096, 2483, 1051, 14693, 16454, 13911, 1007, 1012, 1996, 5699, 2100, 10962, 1997, 20578, 9766, 2020, 8828, 2013, 2192, 2007, 5165, 2011, 2035, 1010, 1998, 2926, 2011, 2336, 1012, 2027, 2020, 2036, 4359, 2000, 16016, 2007, 1037, 2962, 8691, 1010, 1998, 1996, 4525, 19351, 2001, 2109, 2004, 1037, 14894, 2075, 1999, 8434, 6240, 1012, 2053, 1012, 1019, 1012, 2028, 6770, 1997, 16769, 7474, 2854, 1006, 10975, 4609, 2271, 3448, 2532, 1007, 1010, 1998, 2176, 2235, 1010, 18970, 14211, 26033, 2015, 1010, 4593, 1996, 26033, 2015, 2029, 2020, 2691, 2006, 1996, 10996, 3123, 1006, 9508, 10975, 20363, 26289, 1007, 1012, 1996, 16769, 7474, 2854, 2001, 6551, 19593, 2098, 2005, 2833, 1012, 2009, 2001, 12984, 2004, 1037, 12901, 2096, 4840, 1010, 1998, 2036, 4359, 2000, 16016, 2007, 1037, 2962, 8691, 1010, 1998, 2023, 19351, 2001, 5044, 2046, 22619, 1998, 9550, 2000, 7969, 2005, 3467, 2224, 1010, 5399, 1999, 1996, 5450, 1997, 1996, 9550, 10975, 9816, 19351, 1997, 8063, 1998, 7238, 1012, 1996, 14211, 26033, 2015, 1997, 1996, 3748, 3123, 2020, 4011, 2000, 10295, 20632, 3643, 1012, 2053, 1012, 1020, 1012, 2048, 7270, 2869, 1997, 17928, 2891, 7270, 7352, 2050, 1012, 17928, 2891, 7270, 2869, 2020, 3811, 11126, 2004, 1037, 2833, 15415, 2011, 6946, 2802, 1996, 4866, 2846, 1997, 2023, 3269, 2058, 2035, 2789, 2167, 2637, 1012, 2009, 2001, 3855, 2011, 12218, 1998, 2060, 4898, 1997, 1996, 2394, 5701, 1997, 3448, 1010, 2104, 1996, 2171, 1523, 2330, 4887, 2243, 1524, 1010, 2029, 2003, 1037, 7897, 1997, 1996, 2171, 1997, 1996, 7270, 2869, 1999, 1996, 2653, 1997, 2028, 1997, 1996, 6946, 1997, 2632, 7446, 28545, 4518, 1999, 2008, 2555, 1012, 2101, 1010, 2044, 1996, 14557, 1006, 14017, 4609, 2819, 7270, 7352, 2819, 1007, 2018, 2042, 3107, 2046, 2167, 2637, 1010, 8141, 1997, 2122, 2220, 7896, 29411, 9530, 3367, 28551, 2068, 2000, 6523, 2000, 1996, 14557, 1012, 6516, 10375, 1996, 10661, 1997, 14629, 2383, 2042, 4961, 2011, 6505, 1997, 3448, 1012, 2848, 10556, 13728, 1010, 1037, 4467, 17098, 1010, 1999, 2010, 3942, 2000, 2167, 2637, 1010, 9704, 1996, 2691, 2224, 1997, 2122, 7270, 2869, 2011, 1996, 15526, 1997, 2047, 4701, 1006, 102]}, {"score": 0.9176234602928162, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Very early that morning the old priest Angry Horse had gone through the camp and assembled the four official scouts in the council tent and sent them off on their mission. There were three other men who decided to do some scouting on their own and possibly locate a lone buffalo. They were Mad Bear, White, and Old Man Beaver Tree. While the camp was moving to Noisy Water, these three men had gone to the south and west. Mad Bear was sure he saw a Sioux, but White tried to make light of it. Old Man Beaver Tree thought they had better go and see. The Sioux scout was about a half a mile away and as they approached he turned back down the hill. When they got to the top he was riding away far to the west. They made various plans and then decided to cross the creek and as the old man said, \u201cIf anything happens, we can go into the timber.\u201d This party ended in disaster as they were surrounded by a Sioux war party and White and Old Man Beaver Tree were killed. Mad Bear and the old man shot point-blank at the approaching enemy, but the old man was struck in the leg and simply sat down in the path and piled his bow and arrow before him to await his fate. Later his body was found by the Pawnees on their way to their encampment. Of himself, Mad Bear said, I could see the old man sitting there. As I got among the willows along the creek, they shot me in the right shoulder blade. My bow and arrows dropped. I couldn\u2019t hold anything. My arm was just swinging. I held my bow and arrows in my left hand. If they had seen it, they would have killed me, but when I got among the willows they thought I was all right. After a while I heard some growling.

All during this time young men would go out very early in the morning with their bow and arrows to act as sentinels, watching particularly for the Sioux, who lurked about to attack women going to and from the fields. Victory Call always took along his bow and arrows should there be a surprise attack. The Skidi fields were located north-west of the villages. Going out early in the morning, one could see the boys picketing about on the high bluff to the west. That morning as they looked up at a big hill west of Genoa, they would also see someone stationed, scouting around for the enemy. The night before Mad Bear and another man had made up their minds to do this. Before dawn they climbed the high bluff west of Beaver Creek and sat down and looked toward where they were roasting corn. \u201cLook at that smoke. Afterward, we can get some corn,\u201d they said. Their legs were hanging over the bluff. There was a little creek that ran from the southwest into Beaver Creek running parallel with the edge of the bluff where the two men were sitting, and a Sioux had been hiding in a trough and watching them. The two men were talking about the cherries on the side of the bluff and the big yellow plums in the bottom and how they would eat them next day. As they were talking, they heard the Sioux making a noise like a crow. Later Mad Bear told his story. \u201cI got frightened and I never thought of my bow and arrows. I was transfixed with fear when I saw all of them. But all at once I got over it. The other man didn\u2019t get over it. We ran down the bluff to the creek. The other man left his bow and arrows there.\u201d Mad Bear continued: \u201cI don\u2019t see why the other fellow left me and ran away to get under the brush. The Sioux caught him. As I ran down the bluff, I felt a shot through my back. It came out of my chest, but I got into the water anyway and they let me go. The other fellow had disappeared.\u201d We looked in the water for him but couldn\u2019t find him. Long after when someone came back to Nebraska, they thought they saw him and he had been scalped and was ashamed to come back. The Pawnees took Mad Bear over the creek and he was doctored by Heavy-Trophies and Herd-of-Horses. As Mad Bear described it, \u201cThe doctor put his mouth against mine and blew some water with some medicine in it into my mouth and made me swallow it. I had been sleepy all along, but this woke me up. Then they gave me some medicine to chew and water to drink and I felt better and never worried about it again. I sent the doctors home.\u201d Finally the Pawnees came out and killed a big tall Sioux. His bones remained there a long time afterward. One Sioux was killed and one Pawnee killed or scalped.

Horse Finder would advise That-Chief that he intended to bewitch a Mr. A and that in a few days he would be sick. Mr. A got sick as expected and first his family would call in the most eminent physician they had, Big Doctor, for A was an important man. The messenger sent to get him would promise him horses, clothing, and food in payment if he would cure the patient. The doctor came in and, after hearing the symptoms, pronounced it a serious illness and very difficult to treat. He agreed to try it for two days and if there were no results he would have to leave the case to someone else. Possibly he thinks the fee offered is not generous enough. Another doctor is asked to come in, the family offering one horse, a chief\u2019s medal, blankets, and leggings. But apparently the fee is too small for this new man who feels he should get more if he is to treat an important man like Mr. A. Finally someone in the family says, \u201cWhy only one horse? After all if he dies we won\u2019t have anything!\u201d Thus the fee is raised. The second man comes, but gives up in two days. Meanwhile the two schemers have been sitting there and stay all night with the sick man ostensibly as a friendly gesture. When the second man gives up, in desperation, the sick man\u2019s family looks about for help and their attention happens to fall on That-Chief who is right there, and they offer him three horses and a quantity of goods. After considerable maneuvers with the coaching of Horse Finder who has been the original witch, he gives the patient an emetic and there emerges one of the terrible poison pellets, the heelskin of a human corpse wrapped in buffalo wool, painted red, and tied around with horsehair. By this time, however, the parts have separated and the human skin has softened so that it has caused a lot of trouble to the victim. When this successful conclusion has been reached, That-Chief calls in four other doctors to sing and celebrate the cure. They all have a feast at midnight and go to their homes. The next night That-Chief sends his grandson, Might-Be-Chief, to call Horse Finder to his home and they discuss the final stages of the treatment, Horse Finder telling That-Chief that he should instruct the patient to have nothing but blue corn meal mush for a few days until his stomach is in order. Then the other four doctors who have sung with the patient are called in and perhaps one or two more, and they speak of the animals and their ways and have a ceremonial smoke and distribute the goods that That-Chief has received in payment. Of the three horses, That-Chief will give one to the owner of the earth lodge where he is living, one he will keep for himself and give one to Horse Finder. The other doctors will note his special generosity, but may explain it merely by the fact that they both have the same bundle powers.

Although many years would pass before any substantial progress was made to improve the deteriorating health of northern populations, the Northern Health Service branch immediately embarked upon a campaign against the infectious diseases, most notably TB, that were devastating the Inuit. The task, of course, was a formidable one given the total lack of medical facilities, the vast distribution of the population, and the high cost of transporting medical personnel throughout the arctic region. An energetic campaign of medical examinations, chest X-rays, innoculations, and vaccinations began in the late 1940s. In the Eastern Arctic, the C.D. Howe, a government vessel, carried medical equipment, supplies, and personnel to examine the populations of Northern Quebec and Baffin Island. Other medical teams were flown into the isolated areas of the Western Arctic. Individuals who were discovered to have tuberculosis were often flown out immediately to southern hospitals where they would frequently remain for years. A large portion of Holman residents over 30 years of age have spent varying lengths of time at Charles Camsell Hospital in Edmonton receiving medical treatment.

The nurses report that, at least in Holman, residents are conscientious in attending clinics and responsible in abiding by the nurse's advice when sick. Now that housing conditions have improved and people are spending more of their time in the settlement, most homes are clean and neatly maintained. Consequently, the squalor that was prevalent in the early settlement period has virtually disappeared. There are, however, a number of health problems that remain chronic with the local Inuit population: 1) Ear Disorders--Despite the inroads that have been made in other areas of Inuit health, ear infections, most notably otitis media, have become increasingly common among the younger members of the population. A disproportionate number of children have had serious infections resulting in partial loss of hearing. In the past 10 years, it has been quite common to send children out of the settlement for various kinds of ear surgery, such as tympanoplasties and myringotomies. Many adults have also suffered varying degrees of hearing loss as a result of overexposure to snowmobile engines, outboard motors, and high-powered rifles. 2) Dental Health--Dentists who have worked in the settlement universally comment on the abysmal state of teeth and gums, especially among Inuit children. The incidence of dental caries, abscessed teeth, and peridontal disease is exceptionally high and primarily attributed to poor dental hygiene and the high consumption of sugars in the form of candy and soft drinks. It is not uncommon to find teenagers who have had one or more fully decayed teeth pulled out. Although many adults and children have toothbrushes in their homes, the daily brushing of teeth is a rare occurrence. 3) Attitude towards Infectious Disease--Even though most individuals are aware that many diseases are transmitted from one person to another, practices involving the isolation and containment of sick individuals are seldom followed. Social visitation is rarely curtailed if an individual is indisposed. Children are the most flagrant violators of this simple rule of preventative medicine. Since most parents have little direct control over their children, it is difficult for them to keep children contained in their homes for any length of time. Interestingly enough, one teacher noted that many children intentionally attend school when they are sick in order to get attention from teachers and other children. For these reasons, a contagious disease that enters the settlement will inevitably incapacitate a large number of residents and will even go around several times before disappearing altogether. 4) Alcohol Consumption--Deaths from accidents, injuries, and violence are the leading causes of mortality throughout the N.W.T. An unusually large proportion of these are alcohol related. Although Holman does not yet have the same alcohol-related problems as other, larger settlements, the degree of alcohol consumption is definitely on the upswing. Many local residents, drinkers as well as nondrinkers, frequently comment that much more alcohol is being consumed now than in the recent past. With this increase has come a concomitant rise in alcohol-related accidents and violence. More detail on the nature of alcohol consumption is given in a later chapter. 5) Other Health Problems--Other health problems that are on the increase are such things as obesity, acne, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and myopia. Since most of these are related to changing nutritional patterns, they are discussed in the following section.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 25179, 3433, 2000, 2122, 5301, 2966, 2578, 2038, 2042, 5186, 3893, 1012, 1996, 11500, 3189, 2008, 1010, 2012, 2560, 1999, 28925, 2319, 1010, 3901, 2024, 9530, 11020, 11638, 6313, 1999, 7052, 17865, 1998, 3625, 1999, 11113, 28173, 3070, 2011, 1996, 6821, 1005, 1055, 6040, 2043, 5305, 1012, 2085, 2008, 3847, 3785, 2031, 5301, 1998, 2111, 2024, 5938, 2062, 1997, 2037, 2051, 1999, 1996, 4093, 1010, 2087, 5014, 2024, 4550, 1998, 15981, 5224, 1012, 8821, 1010, 1996, 5490, 8787, 2953, 2008, 2001, 15157, 1999, 1996, 2220, 4093, 2558, 2038, 8990, 5419, 1012, 2045, 2024, 1010, 2174, 1010, 1037, 2193, 1997, 2740, 3471, 2008, 3961, 11888, 2007, 1996, 2334, 25179, 2313, 1024, 1015, 1007, 4540, 10840, 1011, 1011, 2750, 1996, 1999, 3217, 19303, 2008, 2031, 2042, 2081, 1999, 2060, 2752, 1997, 25179, 2740, 1010, 4540, 15245, 1010, 2087, 5546, 27178, 13706, 2865, 1010, 2031, 2468, 6233, 2691, 2426, 1996, 3920, 2372, 1997, 1996, 2313, 1012, 1037, 4487, 13102, 18981, 11589, 3258, 3686, 2193, 1997, 2336, 2031, 2018, 3809, 15245, 4525, 1999, 7704, 3279, 1997, 4994, 1012, 1999, 1996, 2627, 2184, 2086, 1010, 2009, 2038, 2042, 3243, 2691, 2000, 4604, 2336, 2041, 1997, 1996, 4093, 2005, 2536, 7957, 1997, 4540, 5970, 1010, 2107, 2004, 5939, 8737, 6761, 24759, 14083, 3111, 1998, 2026, 4892, 11439, 28397, 1012, 2116, 6001, 2031, 2036, 4265, 9671, 5445, 1997, 4994, 3279, 2004, 1037, 2765, 1997, 2058, 10288, 6873, 28632, 2000, 4586, 17751, 5209, 1010, 2041, 6277, 9693, 1010, 1998, 2152, 1011, 6113, 9494, 1012, 1016, 1007, 11394, 2740, 1011, 1011, 24385, 2015, 2040, 2031, 2499, 1999, 1996, 4093, 21186, 7615, 2006, 1996, 11113, 7274, 9067, 2110, 1997, 4091, 1998, 16031, 2015, 1010, 2926, 2426, 25179, 2336, 1012, 1996, 18949, 1997, 11394, 2482, 3111, 1010, 14689, 9623, 6924, 4091, 1010, 1998, 2566, 28201, 9080, 4295, 2003, 17077, 2152, 1998, 3952, 7108, 2000, 3532, 11394, 19548, 1998, 1996, 2152, 8381, 1997, 5699, 2015, 1999, 1996, 2433, 1997, 9485, 1998, 3730, 8974, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2025, 13191, 2000, 2424, 12908, 2040, 2031, 2018, 2028, 2030, 2062, 3929, 13121, 2098, 4091, 2766, 2041, 1012, 2348, 2116, 6001, 1998, 2336, 2031, 11868, 18623, 2229, 1999, 2037, 5014, 1010, 1996, 3679, 12766, 1997, 4091, 2003, 1037, 4678, 14404, 1012, 1017, 1007, 7729, 2875, 16514, 4295, 1011, 1011, 2130, 2295, 2087, 3633, 2024, 5204, 2008, 2116, 7870, 2024, 11860, 2013, 2028, 2711, 2000, 2178, 1010, 6078, 5994, 1996, 12477, 1998, 29174, 1997, 5305, 3633, 2024, 15839, 2628, 1012, 2591, 28877, 2003, 6524, 20099, 17440, 2065, 2019, 3265, 2003, 27427, 2483, 19155, 1012, 2336, 2024, 1996, 2087, 5210, 17884, 10482, 6591, 1997, 2023, 3722, 3627, 1997, 4652, 8082, 4200, 1012, 2144, 2087, 3008, 2031, 2210, 3622, 2491, 2058, 2037, 2336, 1010, 2009, 2003, 3697, 2005, 2068, 2000, 2562, 2336, 4838, 1999, 2037, 5014, 2005, 2151, 3091, 1997, 2051, 1012, 5875, 2135, 2438, 1010, 2028, 3836, 3264, 2008, 2116, 2336, 15734, 5463, 2082, 2043, 2027, 2024, 5305, 1999, 2344, 2000, 2131, 3086, 2013, 5089, 1998, 2060, 2336, 1012, 2005, 2122, 4436, 1010, 1037, 9530, 15900, 6313, 4295, 2008, 8039, 1996, 4093, 2097, 21268, 27523, 19498, 17570, 102]}, {"score": 0.5716420412063599, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "\u201cNo tests were made of the vision.

Many of Higilak's seances in Victoria island were held for the purpose of propitiating or intimidating these shades and dispelling their influence. The natives have no knowledge whatever of medicine, and very little of surgery. A head-ache is sometimes cured by bleeding, broken limbs are set in splints and frozen members are amputated. Aksiatak, for example, disloc ated his ankle while wrestling in the dance-house; he pulled it back into place, covered it with a long deerskin sock and laid three splints around it, one on each side and one at the back, keeping them firmly in place by means of a raw-hide lashing; a second cord running from his hand to the sole of his foot enabled him to raise his leg without bending it. A year later his son Nakitok fell from the roof and broke his thigh; the Eskimos set his leg in splints also. Both accidents were ascribed to the machinations of evil spirits and the shamans were asked to appease them. A painful swelling on the arm of the old shaman Ilatsiak was cured by lancing. For snow-blind-ness the natives use counter-irritants, flooding the eyes with the smoke of burning heather or of the Dryas integrifolia, or tying a louse to a thread and letting it scratch the sclerotis.

Then they would tell me much and show me many things that they had not yet been able to confide to me this time. I was also supposed to bring along many medicines and strings of beads, indeed, stay with them forever if possible, for at the present time first this one and then that one of their children would become ill, and since these maladies stem from the whites, only a white could remedy them. From the third day of my being here, when I had scarcely dispensed the first medicines, I was generally called nkol t = European medicine-man; from then on I retained this name among the northern group for the following 83 cont. years. To be sure, casual wishes and promises on the lips of an Indian do not mean much, but their statements sufficed for me to be able to conclude favorably that I had adopted the right tone in my intercourse with them and that, in this way, we would later probably come closer to each other. This hope encouraged me; for now, in parting, I was under the grievous impression that the thought of the sad fate of this handful of survivors of the once numerous Selk'nam people aroused in me! With anxious care I tore myself away from this camp, as though I were never again to see many of its dear occupants; there vigorously throbbed in me the wish to sit once more in their midst, in order to understand them better and become more closely acquainted with them! When P. Zenone gave me his hand in farewell, he did not hold back his impressions and told me openly: \u201cSo many travelers have already passed by here and gaped at our Indians; but none has come as frankly close to them 84 as you. Even some taciturn old men have liked your visit and confided to me that they want to see you again next year.

There was always a certain tension and lurking irritability between the two. Though, to be sure, outward sociableness prevailed at times, serious hostility not infrequently broke out. This opposition arose rather unconsciously from economic causes. The north people subsisted primarily on the meat of the cururos and used the soft skins of these animals for cloaks. This prompted the south people to make fun of their northern neighbors and look down on them as \u201ccururo eaters.\u201d A transitory penetration of individual south-people into the north country never occurred for hunting purposes, much less, as Tonelli:9 believes, for the stealing of women, though a medicine man from the other region was not infrequently held responsible for sicknesses or cases of accidents and death. There is no reliable clue for guessing at the frequency of such disputes or hostilities. For all this was hidden from the eyes of the but recently arrived whites, and thereafter earlier conditions changed. Nevertheless, the missionaries felt this ancient hostility.

This has already been confirmed (p. 680). For illustration I add an observation by Spegazzini (a):175, who remembers a very old man who was accompanied everywhere by his grandson. The life of the individual person stood and stands in special estimation among those around him, which is why atonement is always demanded for a murder and harsh revenge is taken (p. 629). If an inveterate thief (p. 622) or a person who betrayed the Kloketen secret (p. 1273) was murdered, the generality consented to it, with a view toward warding off greater harm. Suicide seems never to have been practiced (p. 686). (63) Cf. Gallardo:133.

Feuerland /Tierra del Fuego/ offers only very few of these; true medicinal plants are lacking altogether, (64) The fact that medicinal herbs and minerals are not present at all on the Great Island is shown by a study of the country and its flora and fauna.

First of all he sucks a great deal of blood out of the wound and removes small bone splinters; then he puts the two parts of bone belonging together into the normal position, waits until coagulated blood covers the wound, places three to four thumb-thick sticks around the arm, and wraps a long leather strip tightly around it. The arm can and must remain motionless in this binding for about a month, until the broken place has ossified. The people could not say whether gangrene had ever arisen.

When they die, the inmates are buried beneath their beds. In other words, communal huts are also cemeteries. Many human skeletons are found by digging under the beds. Until 1952 this fact was unknown about the Andaman Islanders although it is encountered in all Onge communal huts without exception. An analysis of this custom led to further discoveries: the Onge wish to compel the spirit of a deceased person to remain close to the living as a protection, so they offer it the communal hut for an abode, the idea being that a spirit cannot wander far from the bones of its former body. A series of Onge practices point to this belief: felled enomies must be burned and reduced to ashes in order to render them harmless. Their hostile souls, according to the Onge, rise toward the sky in smoke as the bones are consumed. For the same reason, bones of relatives are fashioned into necklaces. The most conspicuous of these is the ibidanghe , worn generally by women and young girls, which is made from a decorated human jawbone. The aim is to obtain the assistance of the departed relation in fighting illness and bad luck. Direction in hunting, fishing and even quarrelling is supposed to come from the dead kept close to the living. We can trace this belief on the connection between bones and souls to a remote origin: Southern Asia megaliths had, in my opinion, no other cause for offering shelter to spirits and promoting useful relations between the living and the dead. I reached this conclusion after studying the contemporary habits of Travancore mountain and other Indian tribes, particularly the Munda. In Nias we find traces of the same customs as among different peoples of Indonesia and Oceania, who now follow them, often ignoring their original significance and symbolism.

Here are a few more remarks on their eating and drinking habits. For about six months of the year, between November and April, water is scarce in Little Andaman. Every kind of fresh water is then considered good by the Onge, regardless of whether it is a murky infusion of r\u00f3tting leaves or afloat with the putrefied caracases of small animals. During the droughts, marine hermit crabs, of which a profusion is found in Little Andaman even far from the sea-shore, often choose to die in fresh-water pools. They are not removed from the pools. A nautilus shell is sometimes used as a drinking vessel; failing this, the Onge lap up the water like animals, on all fours, directly from the pool. Since they are very fond of dogs, man and dog drink together from the same tiny pool, often holding no more than a few pints of water. Dogs reached Great Andaman as early as 1857; they came to Little Andaman much later. Before that time there were no dogs in the Andamanese Archipelago. They soon became the natives cherished and much appreciated assistants in the hunting of wild pigs.

Concerning honey, and the many sugary fruits of the jungle that are available all the year round, the Onge luckily ignore the simple method of distilling alcohol. No intoxicating drink reaches Little Andaman from the outer world, whereas in Great Andaman alcohol, together with imported syphilis, was one of the main causes of depopulation. No syphilis appears as yet to have reached Little Andaman. This is also confirmed by the research carried out by Dr. Hermann Lehmann of London's St. Bartholomew's Hospital, during February 1953 in my Onge camp in Labanare (north-east coast of Little Andaman).", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 9440, 2641, 7965, 2011, 1996, 2006, 3351, 2421, 6861, 1010, 8038, 5244, 1010, 2195, 10514, 9468, 27581, 6147, 1998, 1996, 6638, 1997, 13170, 1998, 8655, 5063, 1012, 13866, 10624, 12207, 1010, 1037, 5016, 7151, 2200, 2691, 1999, 1996, 1998, 23093, 2015, 1010, 2056, 2011, 22603, 1011, 2829, 1006, 1052, 1012, 25371, 1007, 2000, 2022, 8828, 2011, 1996, 1998, 23093, 16422, 2004, 1037, 3860, 2114, 1054, 5369, 12248, 17456, 1010, 2003, 2196, 2730, 1012, 2005, 2070, 3565, 16643, 20771, 3114, 1996, 2006, 3351, 2024, 3432, 14603, 2012, 1996, 2245, 1997, 7244, 2107, 2019, 8216, 3909, 7151, 1012, 2426, 1996, 10962, 1010, 2216, 1997, 1037, 3269, 3005, 3536, 2038, 2107, 1037, 10073, 2075, 5437, 2008, 2009, 2003, 2124, 1010, 1999, 2394, 1010, 2004, 1523, 14708, 13334, 1524, 1010, 2024, 3373, 2000, 2031, 11813, 9474, 5144, 2005, 1996, 2529, 2303, 1012, 1996, 10962, 3209, 5437, 2130, 4788, 2084, 1996, 3536, 1010, 2021, 2023, 1010, 2000, 1996, 2006, 3351, 1010, 3084, 2068, 10439, 20624, 6774, 2738, 2084, 19424, 1012, 7175, 6861, 1010, 1998, 1996, 2116, 5699, 2100, 10962, 1997, 1996, 8894, 2008, 2024, 2800, 2035, 1996, 2095, 2461, 1010, 1996, 2006, 3351, 15798, 8568, 1996, 3722, 4118, 1997, 4487, 16643, 13112, 6544, 1012, 2053, 2046, 9048, 18252, 4392, 6561, 2210, 1998, 23093, 2013, 1996, 6058, 2088, 1010, 6168, 1999, 2307, 1998, 23093, 6544, 1010, 2362, 2007, 10964, 25353, 21850, 6856, 1010, 2001, 2028, 1997, 1996, 2364, 5320, 1997, 2139, 16340, 9513, 1012, 2053, 25353, 21850, 6856, 3544, 2004, 2664, 2000, 2031, 2584, 2210, 1998, 23093, 1012, 2023, 2003, 2036, 4484, 2011, 1996, 2470, 3344, 2041, 2011, 2852, 1012, 12224, 28444, 2078, 1997, 2414, 1005, 1055, 2358, 1012, 19866, 1005, 1055, 2902, 1010, 2076, 2337, 4052, 1999, 2026, 2006, 3351, 3409, 1999, 6845, 5162, 2890, 1006, 2167, 1011, 2264, 3023, 1997, 2210, 1998, 23093, 1007, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.8581421375274658, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "The Onge, so careful about their food, are completely indifferent to something else that is considered very harmful in continental and insular regions close to the Andamans.

I saw nothing resembing these practices in any other part of the world. Never hitherto described, they should be carefully considered. This would require a lengthy description, for which there is no space here. We may recall that menstruating Onge women are allowed to circulate freely at all times. An interesting detail is that the naquineghe of first menstruations are worn by relations around their neck as having health-giving properties. The women, as we know, use special soft, long leaves, collected for them by their husbands, as absorbents. They are the leaves of Myristica longifolia or of Tretanthera lanceofolia both species serving the purpose. They are applied under the naquineghe and drawn back between the legs to be secured above the buttocks. -- Sexual intercourse is forbidden during the menstrual period even by the Onge: illness -- a swelling of the arms or legs -- would follow. A curious theory about the reason for menstruation in very young girls is that it is a result of previous sexual contacts stimulated by nose rubbing -- the Onge substitute for kissing. They ignore the unhygienic practice of kissing with the lips, and never even kiss their children. Only nose rubbing is practiced. The anatomical structure of the Onge nose, which almost totally lacks nasal bones and is very fleshy, may explain this transference of sensation from nearby regions, i. e. the lips.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 2006, 3351, 1010, 2061, 6176, 2055, 2037, 2833, 1010, 2024, 3294, 24436, 2000, 2242, 2842, 2008, 2003, 2641, 2200, 17631, 1999, 6803, 1998, 16021, 7934, 4655, 2485, 2000, 1996, 1998, 23093, 2015, 1012, 2045, 1010, 2273, 3367, 6820, 5844, 2308, 2024, 2411, 24382, 1998, 2641, 17631, 2000, 1996, 2972, 2451, 1012, 2025, 2061, 1999, 2210, 1998, 23093, 1010, 2073, 1996, 2128, 7583, 3111, 4162, 1999, 1996, 25652, 2024, 5186, 10968, 1006, 12935, 1012, 10514, 18098, 2050, 1007, 1998, 2071, 2763, 2022, 9551, 2000, 14412, 6679, 10893, 23048, 2158, 1012, 1045, 2387, 2498, 24501, 6633, 10472, 2122, 6078, 1999, 2151, 2060, 2112, 1997, 1996, 2088, 1012, 2196, 2718, 5886, 3406, 2649, 1010, 2027, 2323, 2022, 5362, 2641, 1012, 2023, 2052, 5478, 1037, 12401, 6412, 1010, 2005, 2029, 2045, 2003, 2053, 2686, 2182, 1012, 2057, 2089, 9131, 2008, 2273, 3367, 6820, 5844, 2006, 3351, 2308, 2024, 3039, 2000, 25022, 11890, 9869, 10350, 2012, 2035, 2335, 1012, 2019, 5875, 6987, 2003, 2008, 1996, 6583, 12519, 13910, 5369, 1997, 2034, 2273, 3367, 6820, 10708, 2024, 6247, 2011, 4262, 2105, 2037, 3300, 2004, 2383, 2740, 1011, 3228, 5144, 1012, 1996, 2308, 1010, 2004, 2057, 2113, 1010, 2224, 2569, 3730, 1010, 2146, 3727, 1010, 5067, 2005, 2068, 2011, 2037, 19089, 1010, 2004, 16888, 11187, 1012, 2027, 2024, 1996, 3727, 1997, 2026, 15061, 5555, 2146, 29244, 2030, 1997, 29461, 5794, 12399, 2050, 9993, 11253, 10893, 2050, 2119, 2427, 3529, 1996, 3800, 1012, 2027, 2024, 4162, 2104, 1996, 6583, 12519, 13910, 5369, 1998, 4567, 2067, 2090, 1996, 3456, 2000, 2022, 7119, 2682, 1996, 10007, 25384, 1012, 1011, 1011, 4424, 23198, 2003, 10386, 2076, 1996, 2273, 3367, 6820, 2389, 2558, 2130, 2011, 1996, 2006, 3351, 1024, 7355, 1011, 1011, 1037, 18348, 1997, 1996, 2608, 2030, 3456, 1011, 1011, 2052, 3582, 1012, 1037, 8025, 3399, 2055, 1996, 3114, 2005, 2273, 3367, 6820, 3370, 1999, 2200, 2402, 3057, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2003, 1037, 2765, 1997, 3025, 4424, 10402, 25194, 2011, 4451, 10137, 1011, 1011, 1996, 2006, 3351, 7681, 2005, 7618, 1012, 2027, 8568, 1996, 4895, 10536, 11239, 8713, 3218, 1997, 7618, 2007, 1996, 2970, 1010, 1998, 2196, 2130, 3610, 2037, 2336, 1012, 2069, 4451, 10137, 2003, 9051, 1012, 1996, 28141, 3252, 1997, 1996, 2006, 3351, 4451, 1010, 2029, 2471, 6135, 14087, 19077, 5944, 1998, 2003, 2200, 5771, 2100, 1010, 2089, 4863, 2023, 4651, 10127, 1997, 8742, 2013, 3518, 4655, 1010, 1045, 1012, 1041, 1012, 1996, 2970, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.5815658569335938, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "Births take place in the forest and are surrounded by no hygienic precautions or disinfection as conceived by us.

Happily the Andamanese snakes are less deadly than the same species on the continent, and few deaths occur from snake bite; but it can curtail a man's activity for several months. In March 1953 an Onge friend of about 25 who had climbed a tall tree to collect honey, inadvertently seized with his left hand a snake concealed in a tuft of creepers, and was bitten above the elbow. Frightful swelling ensued, together with shooting pains and a raging fever. The man was brought to me unconscious, his left arm had already assumed the appearance of a huge, rigid, elongated sausage. The Onge had smeared all his body, and particularly the wounded arm, with ochre mixed with honey, turtle fat and rough clay. They have no specific remedy for snake bite. It was too late, but in an attempt to save the patient an antiophidic injection was practiced on him. Within a few hours he appeared to rally. I saw him again after eleven days; his arm had been treated in the Onge way and put in a sling made of ficus bark cut into narrow strips. Fever had disappeared, and in part also the swelling, so he could move his elbow a little. The skin peeled off the whole length of the arm. Where the fangs had entered the flesh two round, red, suppurating wounds, 1 cm in diameter, were discernible under a layer of clay and honey. The man recovered in about two months. During his illness the people who shared his communal hut exempted him, his wife and his children from all work, and supplied them with all requirements. This occurs in very case of illness, showing the complete solidarity that prevails among those simple people -- once considered ferocious.

I was with them three times when this recurred, so I could observe their behaviour exhaustively. With their bellies full, the natives rest. Their only activity is body painting, performed by the women on the skin of their peacefully sleeping husbands. Designs change from time to time as I said before, according to the women's inventiveness. Each family challenges the others in renewing their patterns. The best are later reproduced until the next change. From year to year I noticed no real evolution in this rudimentary art, but a cyclical fashion, with temporary preference, in males and females alike, for some geometrical designs, unconnected with whatever kind of food they had been eating. This contradicts the published affirmations of several authors, who allege that the Andamanese paint special patterns in special colours for different kinds of food. There is nothing more false, at least with reference to the Onge. Merry feasting, whether on pork turtle, dugong, fish or honey, leads to a period of rest and body decoration -- always in similar patterns and colours -- with the unique purpose of preventing illness. We might say that painting the body is equal to cleaning it, but this is quite unintentional. A curious exception to the Onge's filthy habits is the practice of sweeping the floor after solemn banquets in communal huts. The surface of the floor consists of unpacked earth hardened by casual tramping. When it is dry, sweeping raises a heavy dust that fills the hut to the ceiling. It deposits there on the wooden beams where the Onge like to store cooked victuals. So they eat their food, as I said before, coated with dust, no matter how thick. A brush without a handle is used to sweep the floor; it is 80 cms long and no thicker than a man's wrist. It is one of the nicest tools made by the Onge, and consists of strong, hard, elastic palm fibres bound together with strips of rattan.

In the turtle-eating ceremony the initiate who, as we shall see later, is in a condition of danger by reason of having eaten turtle for the first time after a period of abstention, is seated on Hibiscus leaves and holds a bundle of the same leaves before him. At the same ceremony the leaves of this tree are used in the dance, and the initiate is given a skewer made from its wood with which to feed himself.

Now this is the tree from which the natives always make their canoe paddles, which, like ropes of Hibiscus fibre, are used in hunting turtle.

It has therefore no special relation to either pig or turtle. There is a belief, however, that the plant does possess special protective powers that make it efficacious against certain dangers coming from the sea. A piece of the plant tied round the neck or worn in the belt of a swimmer is believed to protect him from sharks and other dangerous fish. A piece of it crushed and placed in the sea is said to have stopped a violent storm on one occasion. Thus the Anadendron seems to possess a special power which makes it a source of protection against dangers from the sea. The same is true of the Gnetum edule , though, as this fibre is less valued than that of the Anadendron , it is not supposed to be so powerful in its effects. In regard to the specialisation in the use of these two plants as amulets it seems likely that it is due to a notion of opposition between the things of the forest and the things of the sea. The Andamanese live in a double environment; the jungledwellers live entirely in the forest and have dealings with forest things; they develop knowledge and powers that make them better woodsmen than the coast-dwellers. The latter live by the sea and are chiefly occupied with things of the sea, being skilled in the occupations of fishing and canoeing. There is thus a contrast or opposition between the life of the forest and the life of the shore that runs through all the social life, and I believe that it is this opposition which explains the belief that the Anadendron and the Gnetum , which are essentially forest things, are possessed of a quality that makes them contrary or opposed to all things of the sea.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 20962, 1997, 1996, 9617, 4181, 19440, 6634, 7068, 11667, 2003, 2109, 2005, 2437, 11689, 1010, 6812, 1011, 7817, 1010, 1996, 24551, 1997, 10369, 1011, 12563, 1010, 1998, 2005, 8031, 1996, 4641, 1998, 3347, 5910, 1997, 14601, 27174, 1998, 12563, 1012, 2009, 2038, 3568, 2053, 2569, 7189, 2000, 2593, 10369, 2030, 13170, 1012, 2045, 2003, 1037, 6772, 1010, 2174, 1010, 2008, 1996, 3269, 2515, 10295, 2569, 9474, 4204, 2008, 2191, 2009, 1041, 26989, 3540, 18436, 2114, 3056, 16796, 2746, 2013, 1996, 2712, 1012, 1037, 3538, 1997, 1996, 3269, 5079, 2461, 1996, 3300, 2030, 6247, 1999, 1996, 5583, 1997, 1037, 13361, 2003, 3373, 2000, 4047, 2032, 2013, 12004, 1998, 2060, 4795, 3869, 1012, 1037, 3538, 1997, 2009, 10560, 1998, 2872, 1999, 1996, 2712, 2003, 2056, 2000, 2031, 3030, 1037, 6355, 4040, 2006, 2028, 6686, 1012, 2947, 1996, 9617, 4181, 19440, 3849, 2000, 10295, 1037, 2569, 2373, 2029, 3084, 2009, 1037, 3120, 1997, 3860, 2114, 16796, 2013, 1996, 2712, 1012, 1996, 2168, 2003, 2995, 1997, 1996, 1043, 7159, 2819, 3968, 9307, 1010, 2295, 1010, 2004, 2023, 20962, 2003, 2625, 11126, 2084, 2008, 1997, 1996, 9617, 4181, 19440, 1010, 2009, 2003, 2025, 4011, 2000, 2022, 2061, 3928, 1999, 2049, 3896, 1012, 1999, 7634, 2000, 1996, 2569, 6648, 1999, 1996, 2224, 1997, 2122, 2048, 4264, 2004, 25087, 2015, 2009, 3849, 3497, 2008, 2009, 2003, 2349, 2000, 1037, 9366, 1997, 4559, 2090, 1996, 2477, 1997, 1996, 3224, 1998, 1996, 2477, 1997, 1996, 2712, 1012, 1996, 1998, 23093, 6810, 2444, 1999, 1037, 3313, 4044, 1025, 1996, 8894, 2094, 4381, 2545, 2444, 4498, 1999, 1996, 3224, 1998, 2031, 24069, 2007, 3224, 2477, 1025, 2027, 4503, 3716, 1998, 4204, 2008, 2191, 2068, 2488, 5249, 3549, 2084, 1996, 3023, 1011, 28857, 1012, 1996, 3732, 2444, 2011, 1996, 2712, 1998, 2024, 15897, 4548, 2007, 2477, 1997, 1996, 2712, 1010, 2108, 10571, 1999, 1996, 23374, 1997, 5645, 1998, 14347, 2075, 1012, 2045, 2003, 2947, 1037, 5688, 2030, 4559, 2090, 1996, 2166, 1997, 1996, 3224, 1998, 1996, 2166, 1997, 1996, 5370, 2008, 3216, 2083, 2035, 1996, 2591, 2166, 1010, 1998, 1045, 2903, 2008, 2009, 2003, 2023, 4559, 2029, 7607, 1996, 6772, 2008, 1996, 9617, 4181, 19440, 1998, 1996, 1043, 7159, 2819, 1010, 2029, 2024, 7687, 3224, 2477, 1010, 2024, 8679, 1997, 1037, 3737, 2008, 3084, 2068, 10043, 2030, 4941, 2000, 2035, 2477, 1997, 1996, 2712, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9002237319946289, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "Personal ornaments are made from the fibres that have been mentioned ( Hibiscus, Anadendron, Gnetum ), and we are justified, I think, in regarding such ornaments as being to some extent amulets.

This will be still more evident when we consider the second explanation of the custom that is given by the natives. Many of those whom I questioned stated that after eating dugong, pork, turtle, etc., the body emits an odour, that this odour may attract the spirits of the jungle or the sea, and that to obviate this they paint themselves with clay. This agrees exactly with what Mr Man says in the second passage quoted above. It is confirmed by other customs. I was told that a man who has eaten dugong will not leave the camp until some time after the dugong meat is all finished, for fear that the spirits may smell him and do him harm. It is to be noted in passing that painting the body with clay does not by any means remove the odour that does actually characterise a native after he has been eating fat meat of any kind. We must be careful, in this instance also, not to assume that an Andaman Islander means by \u201csmell\u201d exactly what we mean by it and nothing more. It will be shown later in the chapter that the Andamanese identify the smell of an object with its active magical principle. One example may be given here to show this. The origin of rheumatism in the legs is explained by the natives as being the result of the common practice of preparing the bre of the Anadendron paniculatum by scraping it on the thigh.

This danger may be expressed by saying that the person who has eaten food will, unless he takes certain precautions, be liable to be ill.

Yaramurud , having died through an accident, self-caused, becomes a spirit, but he does so only under the compulsion exercised upon him by his mother, who, now that he is dead, insists that he must go away from the world of the living and become a spirit. The spirit then comes back to see his brother and by this contact causes the brother's death. The story implies that it was not because Yaramurud was evilly disposed towards his brother that he killed him, but on the contrary it was his attachment to his relative that caused him to return to visit him, and death followed as a result of this contact of the living man with the spirit. Since that time deaths have continued to occur in the same way. Thus it appears that the Andamanese conceive that the spirits do not cause death and sickness through evil intention, but through their mere proximity, and, as the legend very clearly shows, the burial customs are intended to cut off the unwilling spirit from contact with the living. This explains also why during the period of mourning the relatives of a dead person are thought to be in danger of sickness, and have more to fear from the spirit than others, for since it is they who were most attached to him during life it is they who are most likely to suffer from contact with him after he is dead.

One example of such a condition is sickness, in which the sick person is unable to pursue his ordinary occupations. Other examples are afforded by a mother, and to a certain extent a father during the period preceding and following the birth of a child, and by a woman during the menstrual period. All these, as various customs show, are believed by the Andamanese to be conditions of danger in which it is necessary to take ritual or magical precautions. A better example for our purpose is that of an adolescent during the period covered by the initiation ceremonies, when, as we have seen, he is as it were cut off from the society, and there is abundant evidence that the Andamanese believe this to be a state of danger. Another example is the condition of a homicide during the period of his isolation. Lastly, we have seen that a mourner is cut of from the ordinary social life, and it may now be noted that the native explanation of the restrictions observed in that state is that if things were not done thus the mourner would be ill; in other words the condition of mourning is one of danger, and the ritual referring to it is the means by which the danger (from the spirit world) is avoided. This explanation does not conflict with the one previously given but on the contrary we can now see that the notion that the mourner is in a position partly withdrawn from active participation in social life necessarily involves the belief that he is in a condition of danger.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2023, 7526, 12748, 2008, 2035, 3785, 1997, 15911, 2591, 4023, 2006, 1996, 2112, 1997, 2019, 3265, 2024, 4795, 1012, 2028, 2742, 1997, 2107, 1037, 4650, 2003, 15556, 1010, 1999, 2029, 1996, 5305, 2711, 2003, 4039, 2000, 7323, 2010, 6623, 23374, 1012, 2060, 4973, 2024, 22891, 2011, 1037, 2388, 1010, 1998, 2000, 1037, 3056, 6698, 1037, 2269, 2076, 1996, 2558, 11003, 1998, 2206, 1996, 4182, 1997, 1037, 2775, 1010, 1998, 2011, 1037, 2450, 2076, 1996, 2273, 3367, 6820, 2389, 2558, 1012, 2035, 2122, 1010, 2004, 2536, 8205, 2265, 1010, 2024, 3373, 2011, 1996, 1998, 23093, 6810, 2000, 2022, 3785, 1997, 5473, 1999, 2029, 2009, 2003, 4072, 2000, 2202, 8887, 2030, 8687, 29361, 1012, 1037, 2488, 2742, 2005, 2256, 3800, 2003, 2008, 1997, 2019, 20274, 2076, 1996, 2558, 3139, 2011, 1996, 17890, 10912, 1010, 2043, 1010, 2004, 2057, 2031, 2464, 1010, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2009, 2020, 3013, 2125, 2013, 1996, 2554, 1010, 1998, 2045, 2003, 12990, 3350, 2008, 1996, 1998, 23093, 6810, 2903, 2023, 2000, 2022, 1037, 2110, 1997, 5473, 1012, 2178, 2742, 2003, 1996, 4650, 1997, 1037, 18268, 2076, 1996, 2558, 1997, 2010, 12477, 1012, 22267, 1010, 2057, 2031, 2464, 2008, 1037, 9587, 21737, 2099, 2003, 3013, 1997, 2013, 1996, 6623, 2591, 2166, 1010, 1998, 2009, 2089, 2085, 2022, 3264, 2008, 1996, 3128, 7526, 1997, 1996, 9259, 5159, 1999, 2008, 2110, 2003, 2008, 2065, 2477, 2020, 2025, 2589, 2947, 1996, 9587, 21737, 2099, 2052, 2022, 5665, 1025, 1999, 2060, 2616, 1996, 4650, 1997, 16236, 2003, 2028, 1997, 5473, 1010, 1998, 1996, 8887, 7727, 2000, 2009, 2003, 1996, 2965, 2011, 2029, 1996, 5473, 1006, 2013, 1996, 4382, 2088, 1007, 2003, 9511, 1012, 2023, 7526, 2515, 2025, 4736, 2007, 1996, 2028, 3130, 2445, 2021, 2006, 1996, 10043, 2057, 2064, 2085, 2156, 2008, 1996, 9366, 2008, 1996, 9587, 21737, 2099, 2003, 1999, 1037, 2597, 6576, 9633, 2013, 3161, 6577, 1999, 2591, 2166, 9352, 7336, 1996, 6772, 2008, 2002, 2003, 1999, 1037, 4650, 1997, 5473, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9636668562889099, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "We may conclude that every condition in which the individual is withdrawn from full participation in active social life is regarded as dangerous for him, and that this is at least one of the reasons why sleep is so regarded.

Under the conditions, the hygiene is almost unknown to them. In most of the cases, washing and cleaning are not done. The bodies of men and women remain almost perpetually covered with clay, mixed with pig or turtle's fat. They just do not bother to clean it and rather keep on giving new layers when the old ones get removed. Because of such a procedure, their bodies keep on emitting unpleasant odour. In this respect, what Cipriani wrote continues to hold true. Accordingly, the more a wife loves her husband the more magnificent designs she executes on him. The paintings on their bodies reach a peak every two or three days, as the Onges feel illness and death if they are not newly daubed, and the face, at least, must be continually painted with at least smear on the chest, arms and legs. Painting of clay on the body is done for various purposes such as for curing of diseases, to decorate on various occasions, to show affection to the husband, in mourning, in menses and for killing pigs. The practice also gives way to various kinds of skin diseases. The diseases of skin are comparatively more common among the Onges. They keep on scratching their hands, feet and the down portion of the abdomen having slightly elevated rashes. Among skin diseases, ring worm is quite common. Apart from skin, the internal diseases, among the Onges are not uncommon. The weather conditions, unhygienic food and other environmental conditions have their own role in causing such diseases. The raw material for food is not properly cleaned. It is boiled in dirty water containing mud and dust. The utensil in which the food is cooked is hardly cleaned. It is used over and over again without being cleaned. Layers of dirt keep on accumulating on the utensils used for cooking and eating purposes. The dogs also eat the left-overs in the same containers. In an Onge camp, slightly beyond Butler Bay, I for the first time saw the pork being cooked by the Onges. When I reached the camp, I found no Onge attending to the cooking. They were relaxing in their Korales. About two yards from one of the corner huts, I observed an eighteen litre tin-container (without any cover), all black from outside with the accumulation of soot, kept on three small stones having fire underneath. The tin-container was almost full of pork pieces and water. Nothing else was added to it. As the fast wind was blowing, there was enough of sand, dust and tree leaves lying on the water surface inside the tin. All these were being boiled with the pork. No Onge was coming to remove them or to cover the tin with something. Sometimes the dogs would come and peep into the tin. When talked to the Onges, it was responded that this is their usual way of cooking. Soon after the pork is boiled, it would be distributed to all the members and consumed as it is. Thus, the pork along with other unwanted material, goes inside the stomachs of the Onges. Such practices ultimately cause stomach upset, dysentry and other related troubles.

They apply their indigenous methods of curing diseases. The most common method of treatment, prevalent among Onges, is to use clay. It is specially done in times of fever. Cipriani has also made a mention of such local practice while stating that, \u2018for any kind of fever the Onges turn immediately to their stock remedy, smearing the entire body with the usual mixture of ochre, turtle fat and honey. The legs, arms, chest and abdomen are then tightly bound with strips of Ficus bark, which are removed and renewed from time to time. Whether the patient has pain in the abdomen or in the chest, appropriate part is given a form of vigorous massage by the feet of one of the bystanders. For fever, the red clay is believed to be having more medical value; white clay is meant to save the skin from insect-bite. According to the Onges, the clay, ochre, honey and turtle fat have medicinal value and are used for cure as well as prevention. The clay as such or mixed with other medical substance, is used in case of the bite by some snake or scorpion, constipation and breast infection. It is further believed that honey, too, has some medical value and helps in quick healing of wounds. In addition to the medicinal substances, another method of curing a patient of wounds and pains is to expose him to hot smoke. The other method is through the \u201choly man\u201d who, with his powers, helps cure some disease. It is also regarded as a chief method of prevention. \u2018Kuvera\u2019 is their traditional medicineman and helps cure the patients suffering from the influence of evil spirits. So far, no agency of health or any other department concerned with providing medical facilities to the Onges exists in any of the camps of the Onges. Even in the two major settlements at Dugong-Creek and South-West Bay, not even a compounder is posted. Some medical facilities exist at Hut Bay, which is a far off place from Onge hutments. Because of their traditional beliefs and the distance the Onges are reluctant to go to the dispensary at Hut Bay. In fact the Onges could be better motivated for modern drugs and medicines provided some agencies in this regard could work right in their major settlement areas. Looking to the problem of biological extinction among the Onges, there is an urgent need to establish better medical facilities at least in the two bigger settlements. The health educator has to convince the Onges about the superiority of the modern methods of treatment. Apart from curing diseases, a thorough medical check-up, at regular intervals of time, of the Onges is desirable. In the context of the declining number of the Onges the health programme should be under-taken on priority basis and in right earnest.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2104, 1996, 4895, 10536, 11239, 8713, 1998, 4895, 20192, 24658, 2100, 3785, 1010, 1996, 2006, 8449, 2562, 2006, 8084, 2007, 2166, 1012, 2027, 6611, 2037, 6284, 4725, 1997, 12731, 4892, 7870, 1012, 1996, 2087, 2691, 4118, 1997, 3949, 1010, 15157, 2426, 2006, 8449, 1010, 2003, 2000, 2224, 5726, 1012, 2009, 2003, 11974, 2589, 1999, 2335, 1997, 9016, 1012, 25022, 18098, 25443, 2038, 2036, 2081, 1037, 5254, 1997, 2107, 2334, 3218, 2096, 5517, 2008, 1010, 1520, 2005, 2151, 2785, 1997, 9016, 1996, 2006, 8449, 2735, 3202, 2000, 2037, 4518, 19519, 1010, 15488, 27242, 1996, 2972, 2303, 2007, 1996, 5156, 8150, 1997, 28166, 2890, 1010, 13170, 6638, 1998, 6861, 1012, 1996, 3456, 1010, 2608, 1010, 3108, 1998, 13878, 2024, 2059, 7371, 5391, 2007, 12970, 1997, 10882, 7874, 11286, 1010, 2029, 2024, 3718, 1998, 9100, 2013, 2051, 2000, 2051, 1012, 3251, 1996, 5776, 2038, 3255, 1999, 1996, 13878, 2030, 1999, 1996, 3108, 1010, 6413, 2112, 2003, 2445, 1037, 2433, 1997, 21813, 21881, 2011, 1996, 2519, 1997, 2028, 1997, 1996, 2011, 21515, 2545, 1012, 2005, 9016, 1010, 1996, 2417, 5726, 2003, 3373, 2000, 2022, 2383, 2062, 2966, 3643, 1025, 2317, 5726, 2003, 3214, 2000, 3828, 1996, 3096, 2013, 14211, 1011, 6805, 1012, 2429, 2000, 1996, 2006, 8449, 1010, 1996, 5726, 1010, 28166, 2890, 1010, 6861, 1998, 13170, 6638, 2031, 20632, 3643, 1998, 2024, 2109, 2005, 9526, 2004, 2092, 2004, 9740, 1012, 1996, 5726, 2004, 2107, 2030, 3816, 2007, 2060, 2966, 9415, 1010, 2003, 2109, 1999, 2553, 1997, 1996, 6805, 2011, 2070, 7488, 2030, 22015, 1010, 9530, 16643, 24952, 2239, 1998, 7388, 8985, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2582, 3373, 2008, 6861, 1010, 2205, 1010, 2038, 2070, 2966, 3643, 1998, 7126, 1999, 4248, 8907, 1997, 8710, 1012, 1999, 2804, 2000, 1996, 20632, 13978, 1010, 2178, 4118, 1997, 12731, 4892, 1037, 5776, 1997, 8710, 1998, 20398, 2003, 2000, 14451, 2032, 2000, 2980, 5610, 1012, 1996, 2060, 4118, 2003, 2083, 1996, 1523, 4151, 2158, 1524, 2040, 1010, 2007, 2010, 4204, 1010, 7126, 9526, 2070, 4295, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2036, 5240, 2004, 1037, 2708, 4118, 1997, 9740, 1012, 1520, 13970, 26061, 1521, 2003, 2037, 3151, 4200, 2386, 1998, 7126, 9526, 1996, 5022, 6114, 2013, 1996, 3747, 1997, 4763, 8633, 1012, 2061, 2521, 1010, 2053, 4034, 1997, 2740, 2030, 2151, 2060, 2533, 4986, 2007, 4346, 2966, 4128, 2000, 1996, 2006, 8449, 6526, 1999, 2151, 1997, 1996, 7958, 1997, 1996, 2006, 8449, 1012, 2130, 1999, 1996, 2048, 2350, 7617, 2012, 8655, 5063, 1011, 3636, 1998, 2148, 1011, 2225, 3016, 1010, 2025, 2130, 1037, 7328, 2121, 2003, 6866, 1012, 2070, 2966, 4128, 4839, 2012, 12570, 3016, 1010, 2029, 2003, 1037, 2521, 2125, 2173, 2013, 2006, 3351, 12570, 8163, 1012, 2138, 1997, 2037, 3151, 9029, 1998, 1996, 3292, 1996, 2006, 8449, 2024, 11542, 2000, 2175, 2000, 1996, 4487, 13102, 6132, 5649, 2012, 12570, 3016, 1012, 1999, 2755, 1996, 2006, 8449, 2071, 2022, 2488, 12774, 2005, 2715, 5850, 1998, 20233, 3024, 2070, 6736, 1999, 2023, 7634, 2071, 2147, 2157, 1999, 2037, 2350, 4093, 2752, 1012, 2559, 2000, 1996, 3291, 1997, 6897, 14446, 2426, 1996, 2006, 8449, 1010, 2045, 2003, 2019, 13661, 2342, 2000, 5323, 2488, 102]}, {"score": 0.9574267864227295, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "The Andamanese believe that the body gets sick when it becomes either too hot or too cold.

What Nau Nukutapu had seen was apparently a particular reef eel which had approached her on several occasions and which she had remarked because its head had been split by a cut with a knife or other implement. She had never seen this phenomenon before and, taken in conjunction with the approach of the eel to her, regarded it as an evil sign. Her husband said to me, \u2018Split in his head he goes in his evil. He is turning evilly. He goes to a person with his head split. It is not certain just what this means, but he is going evilly among us men. He wreaks ill on a man or on a woman.\u2019 At the time of our conversation his wife, who had been obviously ill, probably with some form of influenza which was then common in the island, was feeling much better. I asked if she had dreamed at all of the deity. He said \u2018Yes, for two nights or so.\u2019 She dreamed that the deity took on the semblance of the Ariki Taumako. The figure, apparently that of the chief, appeared on the ritual side of the house and asked her for some biscuit for himself. Her husband said he could not remember whether she gave it biscuit or not. He said that this was a custom of the god to take the form either of the Taumako chief or of his brother or of some other member of the chiefly lineage of Taumako with which he was ritually associated. When he took on the form of a man in this way, it was an evil sign. My friend added that the deity was an evil one indeed. By comparison the god of Sa Kafika was good.

External spirits are of many kinds and degrees of rank and power. Some, such as ancestors, are clearly benevolent, but may harm people if offended. Others, such as the common wandering spirits known as atua vare , not identified individually, are by nature malevolent to mankind. Types of such spirits are those of the water spout at sea, who cause men to throw away their paddles and attempt to commit suicide, or those of the coconut frond, who are associated with black magic. One of these wandering spirits may take up residence in the body of a person, or may abstract his soul and make him ill.

In 1929 a son of the Ariki Tafua fell ill and the chief became very disturbed about this. He had been baptized as a Christian, but this had not meant that he had abandoned all belief in the reality of his traditional gods and spirits. He regarded the illness of his son as due to the action of some malicious spirits, and seeing his son get weaker and imagining that he would die he attempted suicide by hanging (p. 138). This was a despairing act given the rationalization of shaming his traditional gods for not looking after his family. When his suicide attempt had been prevented (and it was never quite clear how far the chief had hoped it would be prevented) he addressed his gods, reproaching them for wanting to take the life of a young man while he himself, an old man, still remained. According to Tikopia belief, in response to this reproach the gods allowed his son to recover, but made the chief himself ill. From this illness he was in turn in Tikopia eyes saved by the effort of his peers, the Ariki Kafika and Ariki Taumako, both pagan chiefs, who visited him and laid hands on him. In the course of the rites which accompanied these proceedings the Ariki Tafua, who was a spirit medium, twice entered the trance state, and in spirit form gave utterance to reassuring statements. But the day before he became ill he had also had a trance and in spirit form spoke to the assembled company, saying \u2018Who is the man who told the chief that he should hang himself?\u2019 The spirit appeared to be very angry. His eldest son and another senior man crawled across the floor of the house to him, and pressed their noses one to each of his knees in token of obeisance. Then they and all the others present in the house assured the spirit that he was mistaken, that it had been the idea of the chief himself alone that he should commit suicide, that no one else had advised him to do so. At last the spirit appeared to be appeased and the trance ended.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 2353, 2553, 2001, 1996, 2087, 6918, 1997, 2035, 1012, 1999, 4612, 1037, 2365, 1997, 1996, 10488, 3211, 11937, 11263, 2050, 3062, 5665, 1998, 1996, 2708, 2150, 2200, 12491, 2055, 2023, 1012, 2002, 2018, 2042, 19775, 2004, 1037, 3017, 1010, 2021, 2023, 2018, 2025, 3214, 2008, 2002, 2018, 4704, 2035, 6772, 1999, 1996, 4507, 1997, 2010, 3151, 5932, 1998, 8633, 1012, 2002, 5240, 1996, 7355, 1997, 2010, 2365, 2004, 2349, 2000, 1996, 2895, 1997, 2070, 24391, 8633, 1010, 1998, 3773, 2010, 2365, 2131, 15863, 1998, 16603, 2008, 2002, 2052, 3280, 2002, 4692, 5920, 2011, 5689, 1006, 1052, 1012, 15028, 1007, 1012, 2023, 2001, 1037, 13905, 2075, 2552, 2445, 1996, 11581, 3989, 1997, 25850, 2075, 2010, 3151, 5932, 2005, 2025, 2559, 2044, 2010, 2155, 1012, 2043, 2010, 5920, 3535, 2018, 2042, 8729, 1006, 1998, 2009, 2001, 2196, 3243, 3154, 2129, 2521, 1996, 2708, 2018, 5113, 2009, 2052, 2022, 8729, 1007, 2002, 8280, 2010, 5932, 1010, 16360, 3217, 21046, 3070, 2068, 2005, 5782, 2000, 2202, 1996, 2166, 1997, 1037, 2402, 2158, 2096, 2002, 2370, 1010, 2019, 2214, 2158, 1010, 2145, 2815, 1012, 2429, 2000, 14841, 3683, 19312, 6772, 1010, 1999, 3433, 2000, 2023, 16360, 3217, 6776, 1996, 5932, 3039, 2010, 2365, 2000, 8980, 1010, 2021, 2081, 1996, 2708, 2370, 5665, 1012, 2013, 2023, 7355, 2002, 2001, 1999, 2735, 1999, 14841, 3683, 19312, 2159, 5552, 2011, 1996, 3947, 1997, 2010, 12746, 1010, 1996, 10488, 3211, 10556, 8873, 2912, 1998, 10488, 3211, 19982, 2863, 3683, 1010, 2119, 14318, 9058, 1010, 2040, 4716, 2032, 1998, 4201, 2398, 2006, 2032, 1012, 1999, 1996, 2607, 1997, 1996, 17105, 2029, 5642, 2122, 8931, 1996, 10488, 3211, 11937, 11263, 2050, 1010, 2040, 2001, 1037, 4382, 5396, 1010, 3807, 3133, 1996, 16588, 2110, 1010, 1998, 1999, 4382, 2433, 2435, 14395, 6651, 2000, 21093, 8635, 1012, 2021, 1996, 2154, 2077, 2002, 2150, 5665, 2002, 2018, 2036, 2018, 1037, 16588, 1998, 1999, 4382, 2433, 3764, 2000, 1996, 9240, 2194, 1010, 3038, 1520, 2040, 2003, 1996, 2158, 2040, 2409, 1996, 2708, 2008, 2002, 2323, 6865, 2370, 1029, 1521, 1996, 4382, 2596, 2000, 2022, 2200, 4854, 1012, 2010, 7310, 2365, 1998, 2178, 3026, 2158, 12425, 2408, 1996, 2723, 1997, 1996, 2160, 2000, 2032, 1010, 1998, 4508, 2037, 27518, 2028, 2000, 2169, 1997, 2010, 5042, 1999, 19204, 1997, 15578, 28138, 1012, 2059, 2027, 1998, 2035, 1996, 2500, 2556, 1999, 1996, 2160, 8916, 1996, 4382, 2008, 2002, 2001, 13534, 1010, 2008, 2009, 2018, 2042, 1996, 2801, 1997, 1996, 2708, 2370, 2894, 2008, 2002, 2323, 10797, 5920, 1010, 2008, 2053, 2028, 2842, 2018, 9449, 2032, 2000, 2079, 2061, 1012, 2012, 2197, 1996, 4382, 2596, 2000, 2022, 10439, 25063, 1998, 1996, 16588, 3092, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9656606316566467, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "In the second case the man's conversion to Christianity had clearly left him with regrets, doubts and fears relating to his continuing belief in the reality of his traditional gods.

When the thirteenth-century Essex peasant Thurcill had his vision of the brilliantly lit Cathedral with the foetid smoke of Hell swirling up outside its walls, he was told by his guide (St Julian) that the coughing of unhappy souls in this smoke was caused by the tithes they had unjustly retained. The brilliant light in the Cathedral, on the other hand, was due to the tithes that the just had rendered. When Thurcill unfortunately happened to cough twice from a whiff of the smoke, his saintly guide suggested that he must have been remiss in paying his tithes. Thurcill admitted this, pleading poverty, to which the saint replied that the giving of tithes increases the fertility of the soil, so that it would have been more profitable for him to have paid up. Such didactic details in the visions were used in local medieval sermons, we are told. 1 A.B. Van Os, Religious Visions: The development of the eschatological elements in mediaeval religious literature , Amsterdam, 1932, pp. 3, 75, etc. But little of this plain speaking occurs in pagan Tikopia accounts. The story of the test barrier of the slippery stone has sometimes been given with a moral connotation--those who have not done their duty by the kava rites miss their footing and are precipitated down no-one knows whither. But this story and its implications have no wide currency. 2 In 1929 the Ariki Taumako told me this. He also told me that people who have lived properly and not killed or committed theft go to their heaven without trouble. Those who have slain men or stolen do not. But he said that this information was generally not known, nor did he have any clear idea what happened to such evil-doers. I noted at the time that this was not a current ethical concept, and regard it as a personal gloss due probably to the unconscious effect of Mission teaching, and the desire to represent pagan knowledge as at bottom no less ethical. There was no evidence in other contexts that the chief paid attention to such a belief. What is much more common however is for spirits of the dead to appear in dreams to the living, or in the trances of spirit mediums, and complain that they have not had proper attention paid to them. Here the tone is definitely one of moral application to the survivors, and this is recognized by the living Tikopia who are spurred on by the belief that if they do not do what is asked the spirit will afflict them with illness or death.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1999, 3038, 2035, 2023, 1045, 2079, 2025, 2812, 2000, 19515, 2008, 1999, 3151, 14841, 3683, 19312, 9686, 7507, 23479, 2045, 2003, 2505, 1997, 1996, 3563, 2106, 28804, 2785, 2029, 2028, 6010, 2005, 2742, 1999, 6115, 1997, 5781, 12018, 1997, 1996, 3017, 2044, 11108, 1012, 2043, 1996, 14725, 1011, 2301, 8862, 14539, 16215, 3126, 6895, 3363, 2018, 2010, 4432, 1997, 1996, 8235, 2135, 5507, 5040, 2007, 1996, 22277, 3775, 2094, 5610, 1997, 3109, 16499, 2039, 2648, 2049, 3681, 1010, 2002, 2001, 2409, 2011, 2010, 5009, 1006, 2358, 6426, 1007, 2008, 1996, 21454, 1997, 12511, 9293, 1999, 2023, 5610, 2001, 3303, 2011, 1996, 14841, 24138, 2027, 2018, 4895, 29427, 2135, 6025, 1012, 1996, 8235, 2422, 1999, 1996, 5040, 1010, 2006, 1996, 2060, 2192, 1010, 2001, 2349, 2000, 1996, 14841, 24138, 2008, 1996, 2074, 2018, 10155, 1012, 2043, 16215, 3126, 6895, 3363, 6854, 3047, 2000, 19340, 3807, 2013, 1037, 1059, 25798, 1997, 1996, 5610, 1010, 2010, 3002, 2135, 5009, 4081, 2008, 2002, 2442, 2031, 2042, 2128, 15630, 2015, 1999, 7079, 2010, 14841, 24138, 1012, 16215, 3126, 6895, 3363, 4914, 2023, 1010, 16418, 5635, 1010, 2000, 2029, 1996, 3002, 3880, 2008, 1996, 3228, 1997, 14841, 24138, 7457, 1996, 17376, 1997, 1996, 5800, 1010, 2061, 2008, 2009, 2052, 2031, 2042, 2062, 15282, 2005, 2032, 2000, 2031, 3825, 2039, 1012, 2107, 2106, 28804, 4751, 1999, 1996, 12018, 2020, 2109, 1999, 2334, 5781, 20855, 1010, 2057, 2024, 2409, 1012, 1015, 1037, 1012, 1038, 1012, 3158, 9808, 1010, 3412, 12018, 1024, 1996, 2458, 1997, 1996, 9686, 7507, 3406, 9966, 3787, 1999, 2865, 13331, 2140, 3412, 3906, 1010, 7598, 1010, 4673, 1010, 4903, 1012, 1017, 1010, 4293, 1010, 4385, 1012, 2021, 2210, 1997, 2023, 5810, 4092, 5158, 1999, 14318, 14841, 3683, 19312, 6115, 1012, 1996, 2466, 1997, 1996, 3231, 8803, 1997, 1996, 22274, 2962, 2038, 2823, 2042, 2445, 2007, 1037, 7191, 9530, 17048, 3370, 1011, 1011, 2216, 2040, 2031, 2025, 2589, 2037, 4611, 2011, 1996, 10556, 3567, 17105, 3335, 2037, 22849, 1998, 2024, 3653, 6895, 23270, 4383, 2091, 2053, 1011, 2028, 4282, 1059, 16584, 5886, 1012, 2021, 2023, 2466, 1998, 2049, 13494, 2031, 2053, 2898, 9598, 1012, 1016, 1999, 4612, 1996, 10488, 3211, 19982, 2863, 3683, 2409, 2033, 2023, 1012, 2002, 2036, 2409, 2033, 2008, 2111, 2040, 2031, 2973, 7919, 1998, 2025, 2730, 2030, 5462, 11933, 2175, 2000, 2037, 6014, 2302, 4390, 1012, 2216, 2040, 2031, 19668, 2273, 2030, 7376, 2079, 2025, 1012, 2021, 2002, 2056, 2008, 2023, 2592, 2001, 3227, 2025, 2124, 1010, 4496, 2106, 2002, 2031, 2151, 3154, 2801, 2054, 3047, 2000, 2107, 4763, 1011, 18629, 2869, 1012, 1045, 3264, 2012, 1996, 2051, 2008, 2023, 2001, 2025, 1037, 2783, 12962, 4145, 1010, 1998, 7634, 2009, 2004, 1037, 3167, 27068, 2349, 2763, 2000, 1996, 9787, 3466, 1997, 3260, 4252, 1010, 1998, 1996, 4792, 2000, 5050, 14318, 3716, 2004, 2012, 3953, 2053, 2625, 12962, 1012, 2045, 2001, 2053, 3350, 1999, 2060, 18046, 2008, 1996, 2708, 3825, 3086, 2000, 2107, 1037, 6772, 1012, 2054, 2003, 2172, 2062, 2691, 2174, 2003, 2005, 8633, 1997, 1996, 2757, 2000, 3711, 1999, 5544, 2000, 1996, 2542, 1010, 2030, 1999, 1996, 16588, 2015, 1997, 4382, 102]}, {"score": 0.9555413722991943, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "What was of great interest here was a modernization of the theory of illness at the same time.

If a person going along a path smelt a pungent scent with no other person nor any fragrant shrub there, that was a sign of the presence of spirits, who had their perfumes just as men had. The sound of a falling stone might betoken a spirit, when no stone is visible. Said Pa Fenuatara: \u2018A spirit who is angry with a man takes up a stone and throws it. A stone which a spirit throws at a man is not there.\u2019 The impact of such an immaterial weapon would be not felt directly but through some symptom of discomfort or illness. Animals behaving in an unusual way might be inhabited by spirits ( Tikopia Ritual and Belief , 1969, pp. 235-9 ). Wandering evilly disposed spirits in the undergrowth or abroad in the path were held to come to men like caterpillars and other crawling things; when a man was ill they were attracted and came and bit him, giving him further complaints. These atua fakafua , evil-bringing spirits, were driven off by atua fangai , nourishing spirits, who were a person's guardians, unless the illness proved too severe; even then they could be kept at bay while more compassionate ancestral spirits bore off the man's soul at death. A description given to me by two young men in 1929 illustrates an aspect of the disgusting habits attributed to such evil spirits. \u2018After a man has died, the spirits sit and count the nights as they go until the fifth night, that of the \u2018scented path\u2019 [a terminal funeral rite] has arrived. The spirits say then that their banana has ripened. That is the body of the man which has rotted in the ground. So the banana of the spirits has become ripe--it is likened to a banana which has ripened. We are living in the house--the men. Our waterbottles are hidden. Thereupon the spirits enter to go and eat their banana--the man who has rotted. When they finish, the spirits come, they come and search, search for the waterbottles of men to drink, to wet their lips. When later we drink from it, we drink and Ugh! it stinks because they have eaten of the dead man.\u2019 Interesting here are the conceptual oppositions--spirits, the antithesis of men, devour men; but what they eat is the antithesis of men--corpses; yet in feeding upon men they illustrate their genesis from men and their dependence upon men....

I never heard any criticism of a person for admitting to being afraid, though some people took pride in not showing fear. In 1929 Pa Fenuatara said he was not afraid of atua and demonstrated this by going alone at night from one side of the island to the other. In telling me this he said that the night before he actually saw an atua about five yards away and it fled before him; he accelerated its going by waving his firestick at it. Atua , he said, were frightened of fire and of all pungent scents, too, though they had their own. But in 1952 Pa Fenuatara asked to borrow my electric torch one night, saying he was afraid, of atua . The difference was probably due to his age, and to the great number of recent deaths in the epidemic, which had generated many stories of ghosts abroad. Standardized personal differences of response to an experience of atua were recognized. I was told how a man going at night sees an atua standing, is frightened, retreats and yells. But another man sees the atua and calls out to it \u2018Wait for me, friend\u2019 or questions it; the atua , seeing this stoutheartedness, disappears.

(A still-born child or one who had perished by infanticide at the time of birth seems to have sometimes been included in this category.) In Tikopia, whereas a child who had lived for some time was buried with due funeral rites even if of minimal character, a foetus or child who had died at the time of birth was simply buried, with no rites at all; it had no social personality. In most cases it was thought that the child's spirit had no part in the religious system thereafter. But occasionally such a spirit might be identified (by a spirit medium) as the cause of the subsequent illness of one of the members of the family, and placated by appeal and offering. Occasionally, too, such a spirit was incorporated into the list of atua worshipped by the group concerned. Structural reasons sometimes accounted for the selection of such foetal spirits, as with a \u2018seedling chief\u2019 who might have been a successor in office. But the choice was usually determined only by idiosyncratic dream or spirit medium announcement. As I have pointed out elsewhere ( Essays on Social Organization and Values , 1964, pp. 254-6), belief in these spirits gave a free field to spirit mediums for diagnosis of illness and for building up their own personal cadre of spirit resources outside the standard set recognized as being available in structured form. Defined usually in terms of their kinship to the descent group which invoked them, such spirits seemed to be believed to have a particularly close relation to their officiant. The spirits of such foetuses or dead neonates, described as toto (blood), fanau pariki (born badly) or memea pariki (infant in bad state), according to stage, were regarded as especially powerful. 1 David Schneider once suggested to me that involved here may be an element of guilt at the practice of infanticide, which overtly in traditional Tikopia society bore no moral stigma, but which may well have been associated with emotional disturbance in some people. I think this a very plausible suggestion. Certainly at times there was disagreement about whether a newborn child should be put to death or not. Not many spirits of this category were used in the kava--most were \u2018familiars\u2019 of spirit mediums--but those who were so invoked tended to be outstanding in reputation.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1037, 2353, 2828, 1997, 11974, 2580, 4382, 1010, 5681, 5845, 2004, 1997, 2350, 4635, 1010, 1998, 2590, 1999, 2116, 18046, 1010, 2001, 1996, 22277, 9080, 4382, 1010, 4031, 1997, 2019, 11324, 2030, 1037, 28616, 21539, 1012, 1006, 1037, 2145, 1011, 2141, 2775, 2030, 2028, 2040, 2018, 23181, 2011, 10527, 21752, 2012, 1996, 2051, 1997, 4182, 3849, 2000, 2031, 2823, 2042, 2443, 1999, 2023, 4696, 1012, 1007, 1999, 14841, 3683, 19312, 1010, 6168, 1037, 2775, 2040, 2018, 2973, 2005, 2070, 2051, 2001, 3950, 2007, 2349, 6715, 17105, 2130, 2065, 1997, 10124, 2839, 1010, 1037, 22277, 5809, 2030, 2775, 2040, 2018, 2351, 2012, 1996, 2051, 1997, 4182, 2001, 3432, 3950, 1010, 2007, 2053, 17105, 2012, 2035, 1025, 2009, 2018, 2053, 2591, 6180, 1012, 1999, 2087, 3572, 2009, 2001, 2245, 2008, 1996, 2775, 1005, 1055, 4382, 2018, 2053, 2112, 1999, 1996, 3412, 2291, 6920, 1012, 2021, 5681, 2107, 1037, 4382, 2453, 2022, 4453, 1006, 2011, 1037, 4382, 5396, 1007, 2004, 1996, 3426, 1997, 1996, 4745, 7355, 1997, 2028, 1997, 1996, 2372, 1997, 1996, 2155, 1010, 1998, 20228, 19629, 3064, 2011, 5574, 1998, 5378, 1012, 5681, 1010, 2205, 1010, 2107, 1037, 4382, 2001, 5100, 2046, 1996, 2862, 1997, 2012, 6692, 22876, 2011, 1996, 2177, 4986, 1012, 8332, 4436, 2823, 14729, 2005, 1996, 4989, 1997, 2107, 22277, 9080, 8633, 1010, 2004, 2007, 1037, 1520, 6534, 2989, 2708, 1521, 2040, 2453, 2031, 2042, 1037, 6332, 1999, 2436, 1012, 2021, 1996, 3601, 2001, 2788, 4340, 2069, 2011, 8909, 10735, 6038, 17510, 3959, 2030, 4382, 5396, 8874, 1012, 2004, 1045, 2031, 4197, 2041, 6974, 1006, 8927, 2006, 2591, 3029, 1998, 5300, 1010, 3546, 1010, 4903, 1012, 22234, 1011, 1020, 1007, 1010, 6772, 1999, 2122, 8633, 2435, 1037, 2489, 2492, 2000, 4382, 5396, 2015, 2005, 11616, 1997, 7355, 1998, 2005, 2311, 2039, 2037, 2219, 3167, 28353, 2890, 1997, 4382, 4219, 2648, 1996, 3115, 2275, 3858, 2004, 2108, 2800, 1999, 14336, 2433, 1012, 4225, 2788, 1999, 3408, 1997, 2037, 27866, 2000, 1996, 6934, 2177, 2029, 24959, 2068, 1010, 2107, 8633, 2790, 2000, 2022, 3373, 2000, 2031, 1037, 3391, 2485, 7189, 2000, 2037, 2125, 24108, 3372, 1012, 1996, 8633, 1997, 2107, 22277, 5809, 2229, 2030, 2757, 16231, 8520, 1010, 2649, 2004, 2000, 3406, 1006, 2668, 1007, 1010, 5470, 4887, 11968, 17471, 1006, 2141, 6649, 1007, 2030, 2033, 4168, 2050, 11968, 17471, 1006, 10527, 1999, 2919, 2110, 1007, 1010, 2429, 2000, 2754, 1010, 2020, 5240, 2004, 2926, 3928, 1012, 1015, 2585, 15159, 2320, 4081, 2000, 2033, 2008, 2920, 2182, 2089, 2022, 2019, 5783, 1997, 8056, 2012, 1996, 3218, 1997, 10527, 21752, 1010, 2029, 2058, 14626, 1999, 3151, 14841, 3683, 19312, 2554, 8501, 2053, 7191, 26453, 1010, 2021, 2029, 2089, 2092, 2031, 2042, 3378, 2007, 6832, 16915, 1999, 2070, 2111, 1012, 1045, 2228, 2023, 1037, 2200, 24286, 10293, 1012, 5121, 2012, 2335, 2045, 2001, 18185, 2055, 3251, 1037, 20662, 2775, 2323, 2022, 2404, 2000, 2331, 2030, 2025, 1012, 2025, 2116, 8633, 1997, 2023, 4696, 2020, 2109, 1999, 1996, 10556, 3567, 1011, 1011, 2087, 2020, 1520, 5220, 2015, 1521, 1997, 4382, 5396, 2015, 1011, 1011, 2021, 2216, 2040, 2020, 2061, 24959, 11121, 2000, 2022, 102]}, {"score": 0.9690988659858704, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "In a related family a daughter was born as the result of the mother's ninth pregnancy. The child was buried alive, in a hole dug by its kin, and left unnamed. A name of this child, Terevai, was \u2018announced\u2019 by a spirit medium, but the child's spirit did not manifest itself among men thereafter. The discussion of this raised an interesting point about Tikopia spirit theory and social structure. When we were talking about this case the woman's eldest daughter, herself a married woman, asked if her mother had not become ill after the neonate was buried. Her father said no; the babe had plenty of kin among the atua and they took it up and cared for it in the spirit world; it was not allowed to \u2018fall down below\u2019 in neglect. The conception was that if the infant had been neglected as a spirit it might have sought vengeance on its living kin--who had been responsible for depriving it of life and had thrust it into the spirit world. If it has become \u2018bad of itself\u2019, that is, has been born dead or has been a foetal miscarriage, then it bears no animosity. But if it has been buried alive it may get angry and afflict members of its family with illness. (Here is evidence of fear if not of guilt at the infanticide.) But with this infant no spirit manifestation took place--it was a tama a fenua , a \u2018child of the land\u2019, the product of wealthy folk with plenty of spirit kin to care for it, so had no occasion for anger at having been sped unceremoniously to the spirit world. This instance indicates not only a finely adjusted sense of balance in the behavioural field, extended into the spirit dimension, but also a rationalization justifying infanticide as a means of population limitation among the upper social strata of Tikopia!", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1999, 1037, 3141, 2155, 1037, 2684, 2001, 2141, 2004, 1996, 2765, 1997, 1996, 2388, 1005, 1055, 6619, 10032, 1012, 1996, 2775, 2001, 3950, 4142, 1010, 1999, 1037, 4920, 8655, 2011, 2049, 12631, 1010, 1998, 2187, 13294, 1012, 1037, 2171, 1997, 2023, 2775, 1010, 28774, 13331, 2072, 1010, 2001, 1520, 2623, 1521, 2011, 1037, 4382, 5396, 1010, 2021, 1996, 2775, 1005, 1055, 4382, 2106, 2025, 19676, 2993, 2426, 2273, 6920, 1012, 1996, 6594, 1997, 2023, 2992, 2019, 5875, 2391, 2055, 14841, 3683, 19312, 4382, 3399, 1998, 2591, 3252, 1012, 2043, 2057, 2020, 3331, 2055, 2023, 2553, 1996, 2450, 1005, 1055, 7310, 2684, 1010, 2841, 1037, 2496, 2450, 1010, 2356, 2065, 2014, 2388, 2018, 2025, 2468, 5665, 2044, 1996, 16231, 3686, 2001, 3950, 1012, 2014, 2269, 2056, 2053, 1025, 1996, 11561, 2018, 7564, 1997, 12631, 2426, 1996, 2012, 6692, 1998, 2027, 2165, 2009, 2039, 1998, 8725, 2005, 2009, 1999, 1996, 4382, 2088, 1025, 2009, 2001, 2025, 3039, 2000, 1520, 2991, 2091, 2917, 1521, 1999, 19046, 1012, 1996, 13120, 2001, 2008, 2065, 1996, 10527, 2018, 2042, 15486, 2004, 1037, 4382, 2009, 2453, 2031, 4912, 14096, 2006, 2049, 2542, 12631, 1011, 1011, 2040, 2018, 2042, 3625, 2005, 2139, 18098, 14966, 2009, 1997, 2166, 1998, 2018, 7400, 2009, 2046, 1996, 4382, 2088, 1012, 2065, 2009, 2038, 2468, 1520, 2919, 1997, 2993, 1521, 1010, 2008, 2003, 1010, 2038, 2042, 2141, 2757, 2030, 2038, 2042, 1037, 22277, 9080, 28616, 21539, 1010, 2059, 2009, 6468, 2053, 2019, 16339, 17759, 1012, 2021, 2065, 2009, 2038, 2042, 3950, 4142, 2009, 2089, 2131, 4854, 1998, 21358, 29301, 2372, 1997, 2049, 2155, 2007, 7355, 1012, 1006, 2182, 2003, 3350, 1997, 3571, 2065, 2025, 1997, 8056, 2012, 1996, 10527, 21752, 1012, 1007, 2021, 2007, 2023, 10527, 2053, 4382, 24491, 2165, 2173, 1011, 1011, 2009, 2001, 1037, 17214, 2050, 1037, 21713, 6692, 1010, 1037, 1520, 2775, 1997, 1996, 2455, 1521, 1010, 1996, 4031, 1997, 7272, 5154, 2007, 7564, 1997, 4382, 12631, 2000, 2729, 2005, 2009, 1010, 2061, 2018, 2053, 6686, 2005, 4963, 2012, 2383, 2042, 16887, 4895, 17119, 26941, 19426, 2000, 1996, 4382, 2088, 1012, 2023, 6013, 7127, 2025, 2069, 1037, 22126, 10426, 3168, 1997, 5703, 1999, 1996, 9164, 2389, 2492, 1010, 3668, 2046, 1996, 4382, 9812, 1010, 2021, 2036, 1037, 11581, 3989, 16114, 2075, 10527, 21752, 2004, 1037, 2965, 1997, 2313, 22718, 2426, 1996, 3356, 2591, 22913, 1997, 14841, 3683, 19312, 999, 102]}, {"score": 0.9662644863128662, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "In Tikopia theory the predisposing factor was human activity, which could be interpreted as human fallibility. A person trod on a place where a spirit lived, had gone to bathe or relieve nature at a pool inhabited by a spirit, slipped on a path or sat upon a stone ordinarily used by a spirit. But the active principle postulated was sex desire, generated by sex difference; the spirit was conceived as being sexually stimulated and having sex intercourse. Since the spirit was invisible, it was held the person had no way of knowing he or she had been interfered with. So the identification was post hoc . Whereas a dreamer had recollections of copulation and, if a man, evidences of semen on his bed mat, someone who was unwittingly seduced at work by a spirit knew only when he became ill, and then usually through a pronouncement by a spirit medium. The expression for this notion of spirit intercourse was toa . The Tikopia would elucidate this only by reiterative examples, but I think the word may be derived from to meaning \u2018to fall\u2019, and may be translated as \u2018overcome\u2019. The mechanism ordinarily conceived by the Tikopia to account for illness following on being \u2018overcome\u2019, and for consequent therapy, was ingenious. It seems to have been thought that a spirit child was generated by the sex congress, and that the illness of its human parent was caused by the child's grieving for his company and summoning him to join it in the spirit world. The means of readjusting the situation was for a spirit medium in trance to assume the role of a tutelary spirit, seek out the spirit child and by blandishment, by threats or by killing the child, induce it to relax its hold upon the sick person. If this move was not successful the person died. In some cases direct intimate contact with a spirit in itself was regarded as leading to illness; in others generation of a spirit child was thought to have resulted in a benevolent relation with its parent. At first sight these conceptualizations of spirit children may seem pointless; why invent these extra entities to complicate the situation? But what this type of elaboration does is to pinpoint the situation in personality terms. A person is stricken with illness, which is identified as the result of intimacy with a spirit. If by location and other circumstances this spirit is identified as one of the regular pantheon, the conceptual mechanism for dealing with it might involve cutting across the purported behaviour of some other spirit and so embroil some other medium or a chief or elder. The creation of a spirit child unique to the situation allows this to be isolated and treated on its own terms, without any danger of appearing to interfere with the relationships of any other human practitioner.

This was the whole field of tautuku , of sorcery. In this a person was believed to be handed over ( soria ) to spirit powers by means of a formula recited by another person controlling such powers, the result being illness or death for the individual so named. (Another expression, fakasoa , to make a friend of, continued this notion of creation of a linkage between human being and spirit, to the detriment of the former.) A case in 1952 illustrated Tikopia belief in such phenomena. A girl who had accused members of the chiefly family of Kafika of stealing food soon after felt ill--it was a time of influenza epidemic--with dizziness and sore belly. It was said by our attendants that she had been \u2018handed over\u2019 by the Kafika people to their deity the Atua Pouri, the Dark God, and that this information was given by her \u2018brother\u2019, a spirit resulting from a miscarriage of her mother's, and appearing in her father, who was a spirit medium. On my checking with the medium he said that his \u2018son\u2019 hadn't said that the girl had been handed over to the Dark God, but that she had been ensorcelled by the Kafika family by being given to the Bamboo Vessel. This, the Vaka a Kofe , was a kind of \u2018death cart\u2019 on the spirit plane. Its material representation was a rough bamboo construction kept in the Kafika temple, known as Te Kaufata , but the invisible counterpart was believed to be used by malevolent spirits as a receptacle for spirits of living people whom they were carrying off ( Work of the Gods , pp. 238-9). Its spiritual use was controlled by the Kafika chief. Now such was the effect of traditional belief that the girl, in her influenzal delirium, had the sensation of being in the Bamboo Vessel. \u2018As she lay down, she said she was turning over in the Vessel--she was lying in the bottom of the Vessel.\u2019 According to the usual procedure, the spirit her \u2018brother\u2019 went to \u2018seek her spirit\u2019 ( sakiri ora ) and having found it, removed it from the Bamboo Vessel, whereupon she lay down peacefully and all was well. The girl's cure was aided by Western pills and cough medicine which we administered, and this was admitted by her father, who explained that the epidemic from abroad and the effects of the Bamboo Vessel had coincided in her case. But realistically, it seemed plausible that the relief given to her by assurance of spirit support helped also in her recovery. Ensorcellment in Tikopia views could be done by means of ancestor spirits or gods. In such contexts both the human agents and the spirits thought to be responsible were stigmatized, whatever be their reputation in other contexts ( Tikopia Ritual and Belief , pp. 199, 211-12).", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2178, 5549, 1997, 4382, 2895, 2001, 7790, 2025, 2061, 2172, 2588, 1996, 6349, 1997, 1037, 4382, 1010, 2009, 2001, 2245, 1010, 2004, 2588, 2008, 1997, 2273, 1012, 2023, 2001, 1996, 2878, 2492, 1997, 21642, 6968, 2226, 1010, 1997, 2061, 19170, 2854, 1012, 1999, 2023, 1037, 2711, 2001, 3373, 2000, 2022, 4375, 2058, 1006, 2061, 4360, 1007, 2000, 4382, 4204, 2011, 2965, 1997, 1037, 5675, 24843, 2011, 2178, 2711, 9756, 2107, 4204, 1010, 1996, 2765, 2108, 7355, 2030, 2331, 2005, 1996, 3265, 2061, 2315, 1012, 1006, 2178, 3670, 1010, 6904, 13716, 10441, 1010, 2000, 2191, 1037, 2767, 1997, 1010, 2506, 2023, 9366, 1997, 4325, 1997, 1037, 4957, 4270, 2090, 2529, 2108, 1998, 4382, 1010, 2000, 1996, 20010, 20026, 4765, 1997, 1996, 2280, 1012, 1007, 1037, 2553, 1999, 3999, 7203, 14841, 3683, 19312, 6772, 1999, 2107, 13352, 1012, 1037, 2611, 2040, 2018, 5496, 2372, 1997, 1996, 15897, 2155, 1997, 10556, 8873, 2912, 1997, 11065, 2833, 2574, 2044, 2371, 5665, 1011, 1011, 2009, 2001, 1037, 2051, 1997, 24442, 16311, 1011, 1011, 2007, 4487, 29212, 1998, 14699, 7579, 1012, 2009, 2001, 2056, 2011, 2256, 26727, 2008, 2016, 2018, 2042, 1520, 4375, 2058, 1521, 2011, 1996, 10556, 8873, 2912, 2111, 2000, 2037, 12764, 1996, 2012, 6692, 10364, 2072, 1010, 1996, 2601, 2643, 1010, 1998, 2008, 2023, 2592, 2001, 2445, 2011, 2014, 1520, 2567, 1521, 1010, 1037, 4382, 4525, 2013, 1037, 28616, 21539, 1997, 2014, 2388, 1005, 1055, 1010, 1998, 6037, 1999, 2014, 2269, 1010, 2040, 2001, 1037, 4382, 5396, 1012, 2006, 2026, 9361, 2007, 1996, 5396, 2002, 2056, 2008, 2010, 1520, 2365, 1521, 2910, 1005, 1056, 2056, 2008, 1996, 2611, 2018, 2042, 4375, 2058, 2000, 1996, 2601, 2643, 1010, 2021, 2008, 2016, 2018, 2042, 4372, 21748, 29109, 3709, 2011, 1996, 10556, 8873, 2912, 2155, 2011, 2108, 2445, 2000, 1996, 15216, 6258, 1012, 2023, 1010, 1996, 12436, 2912, 1037, 12849, 7959, 1010, 2001, 1037, 2785, 1997, 1520, 2331, 11122, 1521, 2006, 1996, 4382, 4946, 1012, 2049, 3430, 6630, 2001, 1037, 5931, 15216, 2810, 2921, 1999, 1996, 10556, 8873, 2912, 3379, 1010, 2124, 2004, 8915, 10556, 16093, 6790, 1010, 2021, 1996, 8841, 13637, 2001, 3373, 2000, 2022, 2109, 2011, 3287, 6767, 16136, 8633, 2004, 1037, 28667, 23606, 18630, 2005, 8633, 1997, 2542, 2111, 3183, 2027, 2020, 4755, 2125, 1006, 2147, 1997, 1996, 5932, 1010, 4903, 1012, 22030, 1011, 1023, 1007, 1012, 2049, 6259, 2224, 2001, 4758, 2011, 1996, 10556, 8873, 2912, 2708, 1012, 2085, 2107, 2001, 1996, 3466, 1997, 3151, 6772, 2008, 1996, 2611, 1010, 1999, 2014, 24442, 2140, 3972, 15735, 2819, 1010, 2018, 1996, 8742, 1997, 2108, 1999, 1996, 15216, 6258, 1012, 1520, 2004, 2016, 3913, 2091, 1010, 2016, 2056, 2016, 2001, 3810, 2058, 1999, 1996, 6258, 1011, 1011, 2016, 2001, 4688, 1999, 1996, 3953, 1997, 1996, 6258, 1012, 1521, 2429, 2000, 1996, 5156, 7709, 1010, 1996, 4382, 2014, 1520, 2567, 1521, 2253, 2000, 1520, 6148, 2014, 4382, 1521, 1006, 7842, 23630, 2072, 2030, 2050, 1007, 1998, 2383, 2179, 2009, 1010, 3718, 2009, 2013, 1996, 15216, 6258, 1010, 26090, 2016, 3913, 2091, 21614, 1998, 2035, 2001, 2092, 1012, 1996, 2611, 1005, 1055, 9526, 2001, 11553, 2011, 102]}, {"score": 0.9679388403892517, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Evidence for these modes of spirit action was available, in circumstantial detail, for very many instances. Evidence for spirit interference with human beings was supplied by the illness of the person concerned, with specification of the circumstances which by accident or human frailty had given opportunity for the spirit to act. In other words, what was adumbrated by such diagnoses was an implicit theory of responsibility-- a spirit medium, representing external society, imputed what had been observed, the illness, to some earlier action of the afflicted person, who had displayed either carelessness or ignorance. Evidence of interference of spirits with the order of nature was given by concrete signs in the behaviour of vegetation and of fish, which gave results in excess or in shortfall of what had been hoped or expected. Some of these concrete signs did seem of unusual character. Tikopia often spoke to me of the Ariki tautai , the \u2018sea-expert chief\u2019, the guardian spirit of canoe and fishing, who with spear or adze would strike a large fish and bring it to the hook of the fisherman. I give a short description of Pa Tearairaki in 1929: \u2018I have heard that a spirit decorates himself in his leaf perfumes, bathes his body in oil, binds the decorative fringe round his waist; another spirit hangs an ornament round his neck, sticks a leaf spray at his back--and he goes to strike a fish. He takes his implements, an adze or a spear or a club. He is the \u201cSea-expert chief\u201d. Now a man speaks words of praise to him, to his \u201cSea-expert chief\u201d, to go and seek a fish to bring it to his canoe, to bring it for food. For the making of his kava, and for his hunger, that he may feed his children. Then [the spirit] brings the fish, the kava is made, and fish are summoned, whether shark or varu , from the ocean. This land, uniquely, is-great in its sea expertise.\u2019 Now the sign that such a fish has been brought by a spirit is the gash made by spear, adze or club on its head or body; Tikopia have often observed such cuts as the fish is brought alongside, before they have hauled it inboard. For a long time I was of the opinion that the Tikopia were either inventing these stories of gashed and bleeding fish or had built up a few incidents into a mythology. But recently studies of the habits of swordfish suggest that the Tikopia may have been relying on empirical evidence after all. Analysis of the stomachs of 500 swordfish by Canadian biologists has showed that many of the fish swallowed by these swordfish \u2018had gashes immediately behind the head\u2019, suggesting that they had been individually marked down by the swordfish rather than fallen victims to an indiscriminate slashing attack on a school. 1 From a note on feeding habits of swordfish, The Times , July 25, 1968.

In a variety of unusual ways he was associated with the head . His vegetal symbol, his \u2018head\u2019, was the breadfruit, known as mei , but also as te uru fenua , the \u2018head of the land\u2019, an indication of its prime place among Tikopia foods ( Primitive Polynesian Economy , 1939, p. 65 ). On the other hand, sprung untimely from the head of his mother, he was cursed as the future bearer of epidemic disease. He was also disaster in another According to Pa Nukutungasau, of Vaisakiri in Fangarere, the rau of the Atua Lasi for the ocean, passed on from his chiefly ancestor Faisangakitetai, who was the founder of the lineage, was Rakaitengaru. This title, \u2018Hasten in the Waves\u2019, was a secret one, corresponding to the more well-known one of Tiporokou. Both were \u2018evil titles\u2019 ( rau pariki ), his man-eating titles. Under this title the god operated under all the skies known to the Tikopia; he destroyed canoes and ships and crews. From his position in the ocean he would see a vessel above, then rise and stand on the deck, and press it down beneath the waves, after which he would devour the men. The hull did not drift on, as is the usual case with a canoe overwhelmed at sea, but sank down to the bottom. Another method he used to destroy vessels was to part the ocean--\u2018to separate the path of the vessel\u2019--so that it fell down in a watery cleft and the waves closed over it; he could then eat the crew at leisure. The total loss of craft at sea, with nothing ever heard of them again, was due to him. \u2018We think that the canoe has been attacked and destroyed in a foreign land, but no; not slain in another land\u2019 (cf. Work of the Gods , p. 301). So in this transformation the god represents the principle of mysterious disaster at sea, though without any particular \u2018head\u2019 referent. But the association between \u2018head\u2019 and \u2018disaster\u2019, seen already in the bursting out from his mother's head, is carried a step further in a variant of the tale of the killing of Tangaroa (see later.) According to Pae Sao, Tangaroa was not the real victim of the attacker Resa; it was the Atua Lasi, and Tangaroa was the result, the pieces of the shattered head . Tangaroa was \u2018the chips of the head of the Atua Lasi\u2019. And a title of the Atua Lasi in Taumako was Te Urupaku, the Dry Head. 1 Paku with short final vowel (ordinarily as pakupaku ) means \u2018dry\u2019; paku with stressed long final vowel means to thud with noise, to resound. The latter meaning would seem to fit the attack by Resa, but I think the former was the pronunciation in the name Te Urupaku. Here without much difficulty one can construct a pattern of L\u00e9vi-Straussian style: Tafito = original or base bursts through uru = head but without destroying it, and becomes himself uru = head, while incurring further power of bearing destruction; he is himself later destroyed by having his own head burst open, which in turn gives rise to another being; but in one context he is named by a \u2018head\u2019 title.

In Tikopia mythology the eel was given a phallic origin ( History and Traditions of Tikopia , 1961, p. 22 ). I remember when I first caught sight of a reef eel in Tikopia, when I knew only vaguely of its local religious associations, being struck by the similarity of its head to that of a male organ. Concupiscence towards women was believed to be a quality of all Tikopia male gods, but eel gods in particular were believed to be inflamed by such desires. Hence women were expected to keep away, not so much from places where material eels were found as from places in which eel gods were ritually invoked. This conceptualization of the eel as one of the most vivid symbols of the sex principle may have been an important component in the attribution of evil powers to it. Parallel to the contrast of destructive as well as creative power of the sex principle in social life was the ambivalent Tikopia attitude towards the eel as respected for his power yet feared for the use of it. More than most other gods the eel god was credited with the power of initiative in evil. The sinuousness of the eel and its great muscular power were related by the Tikopia to their interpretation of illness. It was believed that the eel could curl itself up within the human body for the purpose of doing harm, and the distinction between material and spiritual form was here vague. It was not thought that an eel physically entered a person's body, yet the Ariki Taumako told me in 1929 how when he laid hands on the Ariki Tafua to cure him he actually felt the movement of the eel god under his hand in the patient's belly. Most Tikopia manifested a very strong negative affective attitude in regard to the eel. When on one occasion the channel from the lake to the sea was opened to catch fish, people described to me how disgusting was the sight of the eels writhing their way down the dry watercourse; one man said it made him want to vomit.

By the Ariki Tafua he was invoked under the name of Feke in the kava, in particular for the sacred oven in his canoe yard. As the husband of the Tafua goddess Nau Fiora ( op. cit ., p. 123), he was adjured to furnish a material contribution in the form of a shark or other large fish. The Ariki Tafua identified Feke with the sun and said that he invoked the god also under the title of the Sacred Ray (Kaveitapu). I did not obtain titles of Feke from the kava of the other two chiefs. Pae Sao told me that the title used by the Ariki Fangarere was Black Ray (Kaveiuri), and by Pa Fenumera of Fangarere I was told that Te Urungaru (ordinary term for headache) was a title for Feke used by a former chief of that clan. The Ariki Taumako, who did not invoke Feke in his normal kava, did so, however, when he performed the kava in Niukapu, a lineage offshoot from the chiefly lineage of Taumako, which had settled in Faea long ago. Pa Niukapu explained to me in 1929 that since the autochthonous Nga Faea had been expelled ( History and Traditions of Tikopia , pp. 136 et seq .) their deities were invoked and appeased in the kava of his lineage lest people be devoured by them in revenge: \u2018lest we be eaten by the atua , exasperated because of their men who were slain\u2019. By \u2018eaten\u2019 he meant afflicted with illness and death. So when the kava formula was recited the deities of Nga Faea were invoked first and those of Taumako subsequently. The first title \u2018lifted\u2019 was Feke, then came Taukaveivaru, which he said was a collective term for the rays of Feke. \u2018His rays are gathered together and are made his sons, eight rays collectively.\u2019 This explanation reconciled to some extent the discrepancy noted earlier whereby various elders translated titles such as Kaveitoto as being the names of other deities than Feke. Pa Niukapu said that a famous ancestor of his, a noted sea voyager ( Work of the Gods , p. 377), had gone at his death to Nukutureki, a dwelling of Feke beneath the ocean, and that this name formerly had been applied to an open space near his house (where later the church of St Mary stood). More recently this space had been renamed Putafe (Foam Ancestor) which, he said, was still another honorific title of Feke.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 10768, 3489, 2106, 2025, 11494, 1037, 2200, 2590, 2173, 1999, 1996, 10556, 3567, 7201, 1997, 1996, 9058, 2060, 2084, 1996, 10488, 3211, 10556, 8873, 2912, 1012, 2011, 1996, 10488, 3211, 11937, 11263, 2050, 2002, 2001, 24959, 2104, 1996, 2171, 1997, 10768, 3489, 1999, 1996, 10556, 3567, 1010, 1999, 3327, 2005, 1996, 6730, 17428, 1999, 2010, 14347, 4220, 1012, 2004, 1996, 3129, 1997, 1996, 11937, 11263, 2050, 7804, 6583, 2226, 10882, 6525, 1006, 6728, 1012, 25022, 2102, 1012, 1010, 1052, 1012, 13138, 1007, 1010, 2002, 2001, 4748, 26949, 2000, 6519, 24014, 1037, 3430, 6691, 1999, 1996, 2433, 1997, 1037, 11420, 2030, 2060, 2312, 3869, 1012, 1996, 10488, 3211, 11937, 11263, 2050, 4453, 10768, 3489, 2007, 1996, 3103, 1998, 2056, 2008, 2002, 24959, 1996, 2643, 2036, 2104, 1996, 2516, 1997, 1996, 6730, 4097, 1006, 10556, 3726, 6590, 14289, 1007, 1012, 1045, 2106, 2025, 6855, 4486, 1997, 10768, 3489, 2013, 1996, 10556, 3567, 1997, 1996, 2060, 2048, 9058, 1012, 6643, 2063, 7509, 2409, 2033, 2008, 1996, 2516, 2109, 2011, 1996, 10488, 3211, 15197, 12069, 2890, 2001, 2304, 4097, 1006, 10556, 3726, 17922, 3089, 1007, 1010, 1998, 2011, 6643, 21713, 17897, 2527, 1997, 15197, 12069, 2890, 1045, 2001, 2409, 2008, 8915, 24471, 5575, 15728, 1006, 6623, 2744, 2005, 14978, 1007, 2001, 1037, 2516, 2005, 10768, 3489, 2109, 2011, 1037, 2280, 2708, 1997, 2008, 6338, 1012, 1996, 10488, 3211, 19982, 2863, 3683, 1010, 2040, 2106, 2025, 1999, 6767, 3489, 10768, 3489, 1999, 2010, 3671, 10556, 3567, 1010, 2106, 2061, 1010, 2174, 1010, 2043, 2002, 2864, 1996, 10556, 3567, 1999, 9152, 15750, 14289, 1010, 1037, 13321, 12446, 23416, 2013, 1996, 15897, 13321, 1997, 19982, 2863, 3683, 1010, 2029, 2018, 3876, 1999, 17282, 2050, 2146, 3283, 1012, 6643, 9152, 15750, 14289, 4541, 2000, 2033, 1999, 4612, 2008, 2144, 1996, 8285, 10143, 8747, 3560, 12835, 2050, 17282, 2050, 2018, 2042, 10016, 1006, 2381, 1998, 7443, 1997, 14841, 3683, 19312, 1010, 4903, 1012, 15407, 3802, 7367, 4160, 1012, 1007, 2037, 17091, 2020, 24959, 1998, 10439, 25063, 1999, 1996, 10556, 3567, 1997, 2010, 13321, 26693, 2111, 2022, 16475, 16777, 2011, 2068, 1999, 7195, 1024, 1520, 26693, 2057, 2022, 8828, 2011, 1996, 2012, 6692, 1010, 24379, 2138, 1997, 2037, 2273, 2040, 2020, 19668, 1521, 1012, 2011, 1520, 8828, 1521, 2002, 3214, 21358, 29301, 2098, 2007, 7355, 1998, 2331, 1012, 2061, 2043, 1996, 10556, 3567, 5675, 2001, 24843, 1996, 17091, 1997, 12835, 2050, 17282, 2050, 2020, 24959, 2034, 1998, 2216, 1997, 19982, 2863, 3683, 3525, 1012, 1996, 2034, 2516, 1520, 4196, 1521, 2001, 10768, 3489, 1010, 2059, 2234, 19982, 2912, 3726, 28739, 2226, 1010, 2029, 2002, 2056, 2001, 1037, 7268, 2744, 2005, 1996, 9938, 1997, 10768, 3489, 1012, 1520, 2010, 9938, 2024, 5935, 2362, 1998, 2024, 2081, 2010, 4124, 1010, 2809, 9938, 13643, 1012, 1521, 2023, 7526, 28348, 2000, 2070, 6698, 1996, 5860, 2890, 9739, 5666, 3264, 3041, 13557, 2536, 13376, 5421, 4486, 2107, 2004, 10556, 3726, 9956, 3406, 2004, 2108, 1996, 3415, 1997, 2060, 17091, 2084, 10768, 3489, 1012, 6643, 9152, 15750, 14289, 2056, 2008, 1037, 3297, 13032, 1997, 2010, 1010, 1037, 3264, 2712, 23493, 1006, 2147, 1997, 1996, 5932, 1010, 102]}, {"score": 0.965726912021637, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "While there was disagreement and even confusion about the relationship of some female deities, there was a wide measure of agreement in the recognition of a pair primary to Porima lineage, known generally as A Ruanea, as the same dual entity who assumed different titles and roles over many social groups. A description of them, with a list of titles under which they were invoked (not necessarily complete) was given to me by Pa Porima, in great secrecy and fear, and many other men also gave me information about them, either in interview or in working contexts. On three points all were agreed: that these female deities were invoked very generally--\u2018they are in all lineages\u2019; that they were essentially a pair, with balanced titles; and that their powers were great, tending towards illness and destruction. As a mythic corollary, they were usually identified as the sisters of the Atua i te Uruao, and one of them (opinion varied as to which) was the wife of Pu Taufiti, usually said to be Rata (cf. op. cit ., p. 90). According to Pae Sao in 1929 the two deities lived in a cave known as Te Rua sa Akitunu on Reani. They were sisters of the Atua i te Uruao, generated like him from two sticks which rubbed together produced fire (the fire-plough). When a man climbed Reani the leaves of plants striking his body as he pushed his way through them snatched away his spirit ( mauri ) which goddesses put in their basket.

He was concerned about the health of his wife and children, which he related to his possession of a ritual adze powered by a god of malignant temper whose representation was the reef eel. 3 See Tikopia Ritual and Belief , 1967, pp. 222-5. The woman had had dreams in which she was threatened by the eel, and Pa Nukutapu was anxious to know what the reason was, and if he was responsible. He came to the medium's dwelling one afternoon, having been summoned there by a \u2018spirit\u2019 message. I had previously been having a long seance with the medium, who in trance state awaited his visitor. When Pa Nukutapu unexpectedly saw me there he greeted me with surprise, then put on a comic act. He sat up very straight, locked his hands, rattled on the mat, assumed a fierce expression, then relaxed and said, laughing: \u2018The Atua i Kafika has come!\u2019 This imitation was treated as a mild joke by those present, including the medium in his trance state, but we then turned to serious things. After some general conversation the medium as spirit leaned forward and said to his visitor: \u2018I summoned you, brother, to tell you something\u2019. Then he referred to the adze and accused Pa Nukutapu of having used it improperly, by calling on the god without referring the matter to the control of his chief. Pa Nukutapu listened very seriously but denied that he had acted without due care. He said: \u2018Oh! I have not called upon the name of the Atua\u2019. But the medium repeated several times: \u2018I am only just telling you; I have sympathy for you; I am saying this to you, brother, because you asked me....\u2019 With the repeated denials of Pa Nukutapu the theme changed and concentrated on the assertion that the children had interfered with the adze. Pa Nukutapu said: \u2018I tell the children not to go near the place where I sit, but they won't listen\u2019. Further admonition by the medium in trance state followed, with Pa Nukutapu listening very respectfully. The talk was laconic and allusive to earlier discussion between them, and I did not understand it all, as I listened without interruption; but the medium was clearly searching for a way to identify an explanation which Pa Nukutapu would accept as fitting the facts as he knew them. Then Pa Nukutapu said apologetically, referring to his failure to bring a food gift because of the famine, \u2018there's nothing to make it with--you know\u2019. But he extracted from his belt in a fumbling way a short stick of tobacco, which the medium accepted with good grace as recompense for the consultation.

Pa Nukurotoi could not remember an itemized list of his cures; he simply said: \u2018Very many people have been handled by me and made well.\u2019 Other mediums gave me accounts of a dozen or so patients they had treated, and one medium listed nearly thirty, and said there were more he could not remember. His wife, who had prompted him a little on details, said proudly: \u2018When you look at the list, he has done a great deal of healing\u2019. A medium in 1952 even compared his healing activities to those of medical practitioners, saying: \u2018We doctors ...\u2019 using a Tikopia form of the English word.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2021, 1996, 4382, 5396, 2015, 2020, 2788, 2062, 8916, 1012, 2043, 6643, 16371, 18569, 11439, 2072, 6936, 2010, 5022, 2007, 2033, 2002, 2056, 1999, 8281, 2806, 1024, 1520, 2026, 13032, 3133, 2013, 1996, 8391, 1997, 8633, 1010, 5520, 2046, 2033, 2000, 3066, 2007, 1996, 5305, 2711, 1012, 2045, 6279, 2239, 2002, 9411, 2007, 1996, 15556, 1998, 2045, 2001, 7233, 2006, 1996, 7107, 1012, 1037, 9388, 2080, 1031, 8632, 1997, 11286, 1011, 8416, 1033, 2001, 2059, 3591, 2000, 2033, 1012, 1521, 2002, 2409, 2033, 1997, 1037, 2158, 3005, 7388, 15043, 1010, 2007, 1996, 3255, 9359, 2083, 2010, 2303, 1012, 2002, 11441, 4382, 21358, 29301, 3258, 1025, 1996, 2158, 2018, 2908, 2000, 2010, 13142, 2000, 3269, 16985, 2080, 2043, 2002, 2001, 5360, 2011, 1037, 2931, 12764, 2040, 1040, 8545, 7096, 1999, 1037, 2600, 2227, 2379, 2011, 1010, 1037, 7804, 1997, 1996, 5249, 2542, 1999, 1996, 2598, 1010, 2684, 1997, 1996, 24315, 2643, 1997, 11937, 11263, 2050, 1012, 1996, 2158, 2001, 2059, 21391, 1012, 2002, 2649, 2036, 2129, 1037, 2496, 3232, 2150, 5665, 2007, 5729, 14978, 1998, 2303, 20398, 1025, 2002, 2253, 2000, 2068, 2004, 1037, 5396, 1998, 21391, 2068, 1012, 2059, 1010, 2004, 2001, 2691, 1999, 1996, 6214, 1010, 1996, 6757, 3940, 2513, 2188, 2007, 2032, 2000, 12210, 1996, 9526, 1012, 2004, 1037, 2326, 1997, 28667, 25377, 16700, 2027, 7197, 2032, 1999, 14584, 2010, 2160, 1012, 2006, 2023, 6686, 1996, 3287, 5776, 1005, 1055, 2757, 2567, 6643, 29525, 7869, 2072, 1010, 2004, 1037, 4382, 1010, 1015, 14841, 3683, 19312, 8887, 1998, 6772, 1010, 3476, 1010, 1052, 1012, 19711, 1025, 12935, 1012, 10968, 26572, 20281, 4610, 1010, 3912, 1010, 1052, 1012, 6036, 1012, 3133, 1996, 5396, 1998, 1010, 2061, 2002, 2056, 1010, 4196, 1037, 4121, 2695, 2046, 2597, 1011, 1011, 2028, 2029, 1996, 5396, 2370, 2052, 2031, 2042, 19907, 1997, 8304, 1012, 6643, 16371, 18569, 11439, 2072, 2071, 2025, 3342, 2019, 8875, 3550, 2862, 1997, 2010, 9526, 2015, 1025, 2002, 3432, 2056, 1024, 1520, 2200, 2116, 2111, 2031, 2042, 8971, 2011, 2033, 1998, 2081, 2092, 1012, 1521, 2060, 5396, 2015, 2435, 2033, 6115, 1997, 1037, 6474, 2030, 2061, 5022, 2027, 2018, 5845, 1010, 1998, 2028, 5396, 3205, 3053, 4228, 1010, 1998, 2056, 2045, 2020, 2062, 2002, 2071, 2025, 3342, 1012, 2010, 2564, 1010, 2040, 2018, 9469, 2032, 1037, 2210, 2006, 4751, 1010, 2056, 18067, 1024, 1520, 2043, 2017, 2298, 2012, 1996, 2862, 1010, 2002, 2038, 2589, 1037, 2307, 3066, 1997, 8907, 1521, 1012, 1037, 5396, 1999, 3999, 2130, 4102, 2010, 8907, 3450, 2000, 2216, 1997, 2966, 14617, 1010, 3038, 1024, 1520, 2057, 7435, 1012, 1012, 1012, 1521, 2478, 1037, 14841, 3683, 19312, 2433, 1997, 1996, 2394, 2773, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9533402919769287, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "But at this period the interpretation of the Cross diverged in some cases from its ordinary symbolic Christian meaning. It was used not only as a sacred symbol for the Founder of Christianity and for Christianity itself; it was also used as having power in its own right through its associations. The sign of the cross with the hand, as in many other parts of the Christian world, was not only a symbol of power but also the expression of power. It was believed to exorcise and also to be effective in curing the sick. Physical forms of the cross were also thought to have power in what may be described as a magical way. A cross roughly made of wood might be pushed up in the rafters of a Tikopia dwelling and used to exorcise evil spirits from a sick person. In this it was strictly analogous to pagan Tikopia protective compositions of leaves, and was called by the same term, feao . (The ordinary term for the cross used by Christian Tikopia was the Mota word, ualowolowo .) Similarly, a cross worn on a chain round the neck or on the forehead (Plate VI) of a Christian was his feao , his spiritual protection against physical ills. It was regarded as a sacred object. Crosses were often of wood, but those most admired were of copper or of some white metal such as aluminium or stainless steel. They were often home-made. When ready, they were not taken to be blessed by the priest, but were simply hung round the neck. But when a person went to bathe or to relieve nature, he did not take his cross, but hung it up in his house; it was held that it should not be carried into places of defilement (cf.

For them belief in the actuality of their pagan gods and ancestors, and hence in the importance of remembering the titles and roles of these, was kept alive by events such as the occurrence of sickness in their families. In theory it would have been possible for them to have transferred their interpretation of such illness from the field of pagan spirits to that of the operations of the Christian saints, and to the inscrutable will of God. Alternatively and much less probable at the 1952 period, they might have adopted some version of Western beliefs about the physical causation of sickness. For the most part they had done neither of these, but interpreted causation of the illness in terms of their most immediate conceptual experience, the volitional acts of traditional spirit beings. In part it was thought that these spirits beings acted from malevolence owing to their rejection. But the interpretation was usually more neutral; the spirits were regarded as simply behaving in character, as they always were thought to have done. Sometimes the issue was felt to be obscure: the Christian convert sincerely accepted the new faith, with the supremacy of God, but he did not thereby simply cease to believe in his old gods, and was uncertain whether they were still active around him or not. He had a suspicion that they might afflict him or his family, and also a notion that he still could summon their services if he wished to use them against others. So his ritual knowledge had a strong component of belief in its truth, and was tinged with an element of caution, even fear.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2021, 1996, 6032, 1997, 3151, 3412, 3716, 2426, 2280, 8887, 13376, 2001, 2000, 2070, 3014, 1037, 3853, 1997, 2037, 6772, 2025, 3432, 1999, 2049, 10061, 3606, 2021, 2036, 1999, 2049, 10975, 8490, 12644, 3643, 1012, 2005, 2068, 6772, 1999, 1996, 5025, 3012, 1997, 2037, 14318, 5932, 1998, 10748, 1010, 1998, 6516, 1999, 1996, 5197, 1997, 10397, 1996, 4486, 1998, 4395, 1997, 2122, 1010, 2001, 2921, 4142, 2011, 2824, 2107, 2004, 1996, 14404, 1997, 15556, 1999, 2037, 2945, 1012, 1999, 3399, 2009, 2052, 2031, 2042, 2825, 2005, 2068, 2000, 2031, 4015, 2037, 7613, 1997, 2107, 7355, 2013, 1996, 2492, 1997, 14318, 8633, 2000, 2008, 1997, 1996, 3136, 1997, 1996, 3017, 6586, 1010, 1998, 2000, 1996, 16021, 26775, 23056, 2097, 1997, 2643, 1012, 14084, 1998, 2172, 2625, 15596, 2012, 1996, 3999, 2558, 1010, 2027, 2453, 2031, 4233, 2070, 2544, 1997, 2530, 9029, 2055, 1996, 3558, 6187, 10383, 3508, 1997, 15556, 1012, 2005, 1996, 2087, 2112, 2027, 2018, 2589, 4445, 1997, 2122, 1010, 2021, 10009, 6187, 10383, 3508, 1997, 1996, 7355, 1999, 3408, 1997, 2037, 2087, 6234, 17158, 3325, 1010, 1996, 5285, 22753, 2389, 4490, 1997, 3151, 4382, 9552, 1012, 1999, 2112, 2009, 2001, 2245, 2008, 2122, 8633, 9552, 6051, 2013, 3287, 6767, 22717, 11427, 2000, 2037, 13893, 1012, 2021, 1996, 7613, 2001, 2788, 2062, 8699, 1025, 1996, 8633, 2020, 5240, 2004, 3432, 2022, 3270, 6455, 1999, 2839, 1010, 2004, 2027, 2467, 2020, 2245, 2000, 2031, 2589, 1012, 2823, 1996, 3277, 2001, 2371, 2000, 2022, 14485, 1024, 1996, 3017, 10463, 25664, 3970, 1996, 2047, 4752, 1010, 2007, 1996, 22006, 1997, 2643, 1010, 2021, 2002, 2106, 2025, 8558, 3432, 13236, 2000, 2903, 1999, 2010, 2214, 5932, 1010, 1998, 2001, 9662, 3251, 2027, 2020, 2145, 3161, 2105, 2032, 2030, 2025, 1012, 2002, 2018, 1037, 10928, 2008, 2027, 2453, 21358, 29301, 2032, 2030, 2010, 2155, 1010, 1998, 2036, 1037, 9366, 2008, 2002, 2145, 2071, 18654, 2037, 2578, 2065, 2002, 6257, 2000, 2224, 2068, 2114, 2500, 1012, 2061, 2010, 8887, 3716, 2018, 1037, 2844, 6922, 1997, 6772, 1999, 2049, 3606, 1010, 1998, 2001, 22683, 2007, 2019, 5783, 1997, 14046, 1010, 2130, 3571, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9692608714103699, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "Another man, Christian since boyhood, explained to me how a dead brother of his had come and afflicted with sickness another brother, so that he, too, died.

As the Tikopia put it, \u2018his valuables had not been spread\u2019. Hence as a spirit he came and killed his younger brother. The latter had returned from working on Levers plantation with a chest complaint, which was diagnosed by a spirit medium as due to the activities of the spirit, but too late. The illness, already well established in the sick man's body, was being reinforced by the spirit, who would not relinquish his victim. So the sick man died. In the light of the medium's diagnosis preparations had been made to bury ritually the graveclothes of the brother lost at sea, but the symbolic funeral came too late; the \u2018valuables\u2019 were spread only on the same day as the funeral of his brother. Here was a demonstration of how among long-established Christians it was believed that the spirits of Christian Tikopia could behave precisely in the way in which traditional pagan Tikopia spirits were thought to have behaved. It also illustrated how among the Christian Tikopia of 1952 spirit beliefs of traditional type still operated as sanction for the enforcement of traditional funeral customs.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2178, 2158, 1010, 3017, 2144, 2879, 9021, 1010, 4541, 2000, 2033, 2129, 1037, 2757, 2567, 1997, 2010, 2018, 2272, 1998, 21358, 29301, 2098, 2007, 15556, 2178, 2567, 1010, 2061, 2008, 2002, 1010, 2205, 1010, 2351, 1012, 1996, 2034, 2567, 2018, 2404, 2125, 2000, 2712, 2086, 2077, 1998, 2042, 2439, 1012, 1999, 1996, 14841, 3683, 19312, 3670, 2002, 2001, 1520, 2081, 4954, 1521, 2138, 2053, 8887, 8940, 1997, 6542, 23095, 2229, 1011, 1011, 2053, 12613, 6715, 1011, 1011, 2165, 2173, 2005, 1037, 2146, 2051, 1006, 12935, 1012, 2026, 3787, 1997, 2591, 3029, 1010, 4131, 1010, 4903, 1012, 5786, 1011, 1017, 1010, 6390, 1010, 5127, 23409, 1007, 1012, 2004, 1996, 14841, 3683, 19312, 2404, 2009, 1010, 1520, 2010, 7070, 2015, 2018, 2025, 2042, 3659, 1521, 1012, 6516, 2004, 1037, 4382, 2002, 2234, 1998, 2730, 2010, 3920, 2567, 1012, 1996, 3732, 2018, 2513, 2013, 2551, 2006, 15929, 2015, 10065, 2007, 1037, 3108, 12087, 1010, 2029, 2001, 11441, 2011, 1037, 4382, 5396, 2004, 2349, 2000, 1996, 3450, 1997, 1996, 4382, 1010, 2021, 2205, 2397, 1012, 1996, 7355, 1010, 2525, 2092, 2511, 1999, 1996, 5305, 2158, 1005, 1055, 2303, 1010, 2001, 2108, 11013, 2011, 1996, 4382, 1010, 2040, 2052, 2025, 2128, 4115, 15549, 4095, 2010, 6778, 1012, 2061, 1996, 5305, 2158, 2351, 1012, 1999, 1996, 2422, 1997, 1996, 5396, 1005, 1055, 11616, 12929, 2018, 2042, 2081, 2000, 11010, 8887, 2135, 1996, 6542, 23095, 2229, 1997, 1996, 2567, 2439, 2012, 2712, 1010, 2021, 1996, 12613, 6715, 2234, 2205, 2397, 1025, 1996, 1520, 7070, 2015, 1521, 2020, 3659, 2069, 2006, 1996, 2168, 2154, 2004, 1996, 6715, 1997, 2010, 2567, 1012, 2182, 2001, 1037, 10467, 1997, 2129, 2426, 2146, 1011, 2511, 8135, 2009, 2001, 3373, 2008, 1996, 8633, 1997, 3017, 14841, 3683, 19312, 2071, 16582, 10785, 1999, 1996, 2126, 1999, 2029, 3151, 14318, 14841, 3683, 19312, 8633, 2020, 2245, 2000, 2031, 26979, 1012, 2009, 2036, 7203, 2129, 2426, 1996, 3017, 14841, 3683, 19312, 1997, 3999, 4382, 9029, 1997, 3151, 2828, 2145, 3498, 2004, 2624, 7542, 2005, 1996, 7285, 1997, 3151, 6715, 8205, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9605190753936768, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "But clearly the mental processes involved were not without strain, and the wrench in proposing to abandon his traditional rites became apparent in symbolic form.

He turned his back upon his son, angry because the kava was being given up. Then the chief fell ill--he was sore in his chest, his eyes became blurred, his head was swimming and his back ached. Finally, he had something like a boil on his back, at the left loin--a pitted scar was still remaining. He recovered without the aid of the priest--there was no priest on Tikopia at that time. Some of his followers pointed out to me that the atua came to the chief in this way because unlike the Ariki Kafika he had made kava continuously for a long period, so they objected to his abandoning it.

But while Tikopia is rigid in its adherence to the principle of patrilineal descent, it does not confine spiritual benefits so closely, and custom allows help to be obtained by resort to another than one's own lineage or clan head. (This custom has an advantage in that it is part of the mechanism of organization in practice and theory to deal with failure.) On the other hand, \u201cmagic\u201d of protection can also be performed by persons of another social category, the spirit mediums ( vaka atua ). For practice in this capacity no particular status is required, only the ability to enter a state of dissociation and give the appropriate social responses. Here is an opportunity for women. No woman can be a chief or a ritual elder, 6 The status of \u201cFemale chief\u201d -- Ariki fafine, is a special one, with social functions, and ritual significance, but without the political control and ritual duties of the normal male chief. but it is not uncommon for women, of ordinary as well as chiefly families, to be spirit mediums.

This provision of alternative is seen more clearly with the \u201cmagic\u201d of protection. In traditional Tikopia ritual the \u201cmagic\u201d of protection is epitomised especially by the wearing of an oiled leaf circlet, put round the neck of a person by a chief or ritual elder with a formula for health and welfare. This is still done in pagan circles, and has the sociological function of serving as a demonstration of a ritual relation, and up to a point, a political relation between the person so invested and the man of rank. Practising Christians do not normally have such investment. But a similar function for them is fulfilled by the wearing of the Cross. Both it and the leaf necklet are described by the same general term feao , a ritually protective token. A conversation I had with two Christian lads in 1952 will illustrate the point. The Ariki Taumako, one of the three pagan chiefs, was about to hold an investiture one morning. I asked the lads if the leaf circlet was effective, was it \u201ccorrect\u201d? They answered that it was -- \u201cthe blocking of anything foolish\u201d, i. e. of maleficient influences. \u201cThen why don't you two go and get your circlets?\u201d I asked ironically. \u201cThe dark crowd\u201d -- i. e. it's a pagan affair. \u201cHave you got your own protection then?\u201d \u201cYes! the necklet of the Church.\u201d The Cross on a chain round the neck was their feao , their spiritual protection against physical ills. Such a Cross can be made by anyone, they said, from the appropriate materials -- copper and a white metal such as aluminium or stainless steel. When it is made it does not need to be taken to be blessed by the priest; it is simply hung on the neck. But when the person goes to bathe, or to excrete, it should not be taken, but hung up in the house.

But in another direction, that of spirit mediumship for healing, there seemed to have been some enlargement of role. There were three reasons for this. Firstly, the relatively smaller part played by the rituals of the pagan chiefs in the total Tikopia sphere gave those of the spirit mediums more importance. Secondly, in the loosoned state of Tikopia ritual allegiance, they were relatively freer agents, operating outside the authority of the chiefs to a greater extent than formerly. Thirdly, whereas in 1929 spirit mediums were tolerated within the Church, a sharpening of the doctrinal and political issues of Christianity versus the traditional beliefs had by 1952 made their position more controversial. Another reason too perhaps, was that by 1952 the limitations of Christianity as a means of preservation of bodily health were more clearly realised than in 1929, so that many people, Christian as well as pagan, tended to turn in time of sickness to others than the Christian priest and teachers. In the absence of developed medical facilities on the island, they turned to the spirit mediums.

In 1952 my impression was that such accusations were at least as common. One spirit medium, a woman, cited three cases of patients of hers who had been made ill by sorcery. Another spirit medium, a man, gave sorcery as the reason why the shoals of fish -- mackerel and another small pelagic fish -- which he claimed to have brought inshore did not always come in over the reef, where they could be caught. He commented \u201cIf I knew the man who worked sorcery on the fish, I would tell you his name, that you might write it down, but I do not know. A man who practises sorcery, his mind is evil, he's a bad man.\u201d He was a Christian, as also were his family, who shared his views. Another case concerned a girl in the village where we lived. She fell ill, probably with the influenza which was then beginning to be epidemic. By various village people, including her father, she was said to have been affected by sorcery, because she had accused two men of chiefly family of having stolen some of our food.

Both mingle the mundane and the marvellous. A woman must be impregnated to conceive, but her impregnator is a gecko-spirit-man. Children are born by the ordinary route, but they converse while being born, and one bursts out from his mother's head. Both versions make casual use of much Tikopia cultural furniture which logically could come only later in the scheme of things--a wooden bowl, a bark-cloth belt, an assembly to determine the man responsible for a woman's pregnancy. Both versions also provide a traditional referent for major sectors of the Tikopia social system. The tale foreshadows the existence of the four clans by using clan names in referring to the deities, and in one case by stating baldly that they produced the modern chiefs. The tale also draws attention to the social importance of primogeniture in Tikopia, which is emphasized by the device whereby Tafito gained primacy over Semoana who would otherwise have been his elder brother. Perhaps here also is an expression in fantasy of sibling hostility, resolved in the tale by the victory of a younger over the eldest brother, though this victory is achieved only at a price--his disease and death endowment. The tale accounts also for the special association of Fangarere clan and chief with epidemic disease. Attributing hurricanes and other natural afflictions to the untimely breach of the birth process by Tafito, the tale implies a requirement of order in nature. It says in effect that disorder in one natural process is likely to be followed by disorder in another. (As another statement put it, illness and death lie with Tafito. As he sprang from the head of his mother, in anger she called out to him that sickness and death should go with him. And Tafito was the major Fangarere god.) In its second part, the incident with Tikarau the usurper, the tale provides a basis for an understanding of the \u201ctotemic\u201d ascription of certain major foodstuffs to clan control, with attendant ritual procedures. 7 Firth, 1930-1, b.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2009, 2003, 16021, 18300, 3512, 2000, 12826, 2122, 2048, 4617, 1997, 2023, 7321, 6925, 1012, 2119, 11861, 2571, 1996, 24684, 1998, 1996, 8348, 15534, 1012, 1037, 2450, 2442, 2022, 17727, 2890, 16989, 3064, 2000, 9530, 3401, 3512, 1010, 2021, 2014, 17727, 2890, 16989, 4263, 2003, 1037, 16216, 19665, 1011, 4382, 1011, 2158, 1012, 2336, 2024, 2141, 2011, 1996, 6623, 2799, 1010, 2021, 2027, 23705, 2096, 2108, 2141, 1010, 1998, 2028, 19239, 2041, 2013, 2010, 2388, 1005, 1055, 2132, 1012, 2119, 4617, 2191, 10017, 2224, 1997, 2172, 14841, 3683, 19312, 3451, 7390, 2029, 11177, 2135, 2071, 2272, 2069, 2101, 1999, 1996, 5679, 1997, 2477, 1011, 1011, 1037, 4799, 4605, 1010, 1037, 11286, 1011, 8416, 5583, 1010, 2019, 3320, 2000, 5646, 1996, 2158, 3625, 2005, 1037, 2450, 1005, 1055, 10032, 1012, 2119, 4617, 2036, 3073, 1037, 3151, 6523, 4765, 2005, 2350, 11105, 1997, 1996, 14841, 3683, 19312, 2591, 2291, 1012, 1996, 6925, 18921, 7377, 3527, 9333, 1996, 4598, 1997, 1996, 2176, 16411, 2011, 2478, 6338, 3415, 1999, 7727, 2000, 1996, 17091, 1010, 1998, 1999, 2028, 2553, 2011, 5517, 13852, 2135, 2008, 2027, 2550, 1996, 2715, 9058, 1012, 1996, 6925, 2036, 9891, 3086, 2000, 1996, 2591, 5197, 1997, 26927, 5302, 6914, 4183, 5397, 1999, 14841, 3683, 19312, 1010, 2029, 2003, 13155, 2011, 1996, 5080, 13557, 11937, 8873, 3406, 4227, 21111, 5666, 2058, 7367, 5302, 5162, 2040, 2052, 4728, 2031, 2042, 2010, 6422, 2567, 1012, 3383, 2182, 2036, 2003, 2019, 3670, 1999, 5913, 1997, 22941, 18258, 1010, 10395, 1999, 1996, 6925, 2011, 1996, 3377, 1997, 1037, 3920, 2058, 1996, 7310, 2567, 1010, 2295, 2023, 3377, 2003, 4719, 2069, 2012, 1037, 3976, 1011, 1011, 2010, 4295, 1998, 2331, 15108, 1012, 1996, 6925, 6115, 2036, 2005, 1996, 2569, 2523, 1997, 15197, 12069, 2890, 6338, 1998, 2708, 2007, 16311, 4295, 1012, 2012, 18886, 8569, 3436, 17035, 1998, 2060, 3019, 21358, 29301, 8496, 2000, 1996, 4895, 7292, 2135, 12510, 1997, 1996, 4182, 2832, 2011, 11937, 8873, 3406, 1010, 1996, 6925, 12748, 1037, 9095, 1997, 2344, 1999, 3267, 1012, 2009, 2758, 1999, 3466, 2008, 8761, 1999, 2028, 3019, 2832, 2003, 3497, 2000, 2022, 2628, 2011, 8761, 1999, 2178, 1012, 1006, 2004, 2178, 4861, 2404, 2009, 1010, 7355, 1998, 2331, 4682, 2007, 11937, 8873, 3406, 1012, 2004, 2002, 15627, 2013, 1996, 2132, 1997, 2010, 2388, 1010, 1999, 4963, 2016, 2170, 2041, 2000, 2032, 2008, 15556, 1998, 2331, 2323, 2175, 2007, 2032, 1012, 1998, 11937, 8873, 3406, 2001, 1996, 2350, 15197, 12069, 2890, 2643, 1012, 1007, 1999, 2049, 2117, 2112, 1010, 1996, 5043, 2007, 14841, 16566, 2226, 1996, 2149, 3126, 4842, 1010, 1996, 6925, 3640, 1037, 3978, 2005, 2019, 4824, 1997, 1996, 1523, 2000, 18532, 2594, 1524, 2004, 23235, 3258, 1997, 3056, 2350, 9440, 8525, 21807, 2000, 6338, 2491, 1010, 2007, 16742, 8887, 8853, 1012, 1021, 25138, 1010, 4479, 1011, 1015, 1010, 1038, 1012, 102]}, {"score": 0.9690332412719727, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "The personal name of this man-god was Saku, or as some said, Sako; according to Pa Fenuatara, his descendant, he was known on earth as Pu Siku. He was the son of the Kafika chief Asoaso (see Chap. 4). He was a \u201csacred child\u201d (nephew) to the people of Nga Faea, since his mother came from that group, and tradition links his name with that of one section of the modern representatives of Nga Faea, the lineage of Siku. 24 Those who look for similarities may note that according to Codrington (1891, 94-9) a chief of Florida named Siko, who afterwards became a ghost, instituted the seasonal Matambala rites. One member of this group, son of Pa Fangatoto, bore in 1929 the personal name Sako. Ordinarily however, the personal name of the mangod was never uttered by Tikopia. He was known instead as Te Atua i Kafika, \u201cthe Deity of Kafika\u201d, or more familiarly by the people of the clan merely as \u201cTe Atua\u201d, \u201cThe Deity\u201d, no further specification being needed. This is in itself an indication of his supremacy. He bore also several ritual names which were invoked on appropriate occasions by the different clan chiefs. His personal name among the gods, which was consequently that most properly to be invoked in the kava , was Mapusia. By the Ariki Kafika, however, he was called upon often under the honorific title of \u201cToku Ariki Tapu\u201d, \u201cMy Sacred Chief\u201d. The personal name Mapusia was rarely used in the kava on account of its sacredness--\u201cit is not called upon, called upon constantly\u201d said the Ariki in justification of his euphemistic mode of address. Another of these titles was \u201cTe Ariki Fakamataku\u201d, \u201cThe Fear-Causing Chief\u201d. He was regarded as principally responsible for storms and thunder, which was caused by the trailing of his staff as he walked through the heavens clattering it from side to side and making the welkin resound. His anger was believed to be terrible. He could overwhelm an offender by striking him or his family with sickness and death. He could blast the whole island with drought, a hurricane or pestilence. Although he was the principal deity of the Kafika clan alone, he was feared by all the people of the island. Pa Vainunu said, \u201cLook at the chiefly houses--they are respected, it is true--but the whole of the land obeys the one Chief, the chief of the Kafika. In this land which stands here the one god is above all others, the Deity of Kafika. No god can come and supplant him; he is high because he is strong.\u201d This was a partisan statement, from a man of Kafika, but it did express the situation as it actually appeared.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1996, 3167, 2171, 1997, 2023, 2158, 1011, 2643, 2001, 7842, 5283, 1010, 2030, 2004, 2070, 2056, 1010, 7842, 3683, 1025, 2429, 2000, 6643, 21713, 6692, 27115, 1010, 2010, 12608, 1010, 2002, 2001, 2124, 2006, 3011, 2004, 16405, 9033, 5283, 1012, 2002, 2001, 1996, 2365, 1997, 1996, 10556, 8873, 2912, 2708, 2004, 10441, 6499, 1006, 2156, 15775, 2361, 1012, 1018, 1007, 1012, 2002, 2001, 1037, 1523, 6730, 2775, 1524, 1006, 7833, 1007, 2000, 1996, 2111, 1997, 12835, 2050, 17282, 2050, 1010, 2144, 2010, 2388, 2234, 2013, 2008, 2177, 1010, 1998, 4535, 6971, 2010, 2171, 2007, 2008, 1997, 2028, 2930, 1997, 1996, 2715, 4505, 1997, 12835, 2050, 17282, 2050, 1010, 1996, 13321, 1997, 9033, 5283, 1012, 2484, 2216, 2040, 2298, 2005, 12319, 2089, 3602, 2008, 2429, 2000, 19429, 17281, 1006, 6607, 1010, 6365, 1011, 1023, 1007, 1037, 2708, 1997, 3516, 2315, 9033, 3683, 1010, 2040, 5728, 2150, 1037, 5745, 1010, 14948, 1996, 12348, 22640, 11201, 2721, 17105, 1012, 2028, 2266, 1997, 2023, 2177, 1010, 2365, 1997, 6643, 15197, 10610, 3406, 1010, 8501, 1999, 4612, 1996, 3167, 2171, 7842, 3683, 1012, 2030, 18979, 11272, 2174, 1010, 1996, 3167, 2171, 1997, 1996, 24792, 2094, 2001, 2196, 20947, 2011, 14841, 3683, 19312, 1012, 2002, 2001, 2124, 2612, 2004, 8915, 2012, 6692, 1045, 10556, 8873, 2912, 1010, 1523, 1996, 12764, 1997, 10556, 8873, 2912, 1524, 1010, 2030, 2062, 5220, 2135, 2011, 1996, 2111, 1997, 1996, 6338, 6414, 2004, 1523, 8915, 2012, 6692, 1524, 1010, 1523, 1996, 12764, 1524, 1010, 2053, 2582, 12827, 2108, 2734, 1012, 2023, 2003, 1999, 2993, 2019, 12407, 1997, 2010, 22006, 1012, 2002, 8501, 2036, 2195, 8887, 3415, 2029, 2020, 24959, 2006, 6413, 6642, 2011, 1996, 2367, 6338, 9058, 1012, 2010, 3167, 2171, 2426, 1996, 5932, 1010, 2029, 2001, 8821, 2008, 2087, 7919, 2000, 2022, 24959, 1999, 1996, 10556, 3567, 1010, 2001, 4949, 24118, 1012, 2011, 1996, 10488, 3211, 10556, 8873, 2912, 1010, 2174, 1010, 2002, 2001, 2170, 2588, 2411, 2104, 1996, 3932, 18513, 2516, 1997, 1523, 2000, 5283, 10488, 3211, 11112, 2226, 1524, 1010, 1523, 2026, 6730, 2708, 1524, 1012, 1996, 3167, 2171, 4949, 24118, 2001, 6524, 2109, 1999, 1996, 10556, 3567, 2006, 4070, 1997, 2049, 6730, 2791, 1011, 1011, 1523, 2009, 2003, 2025, 2170, 2588, 1010, 2170, 2588, 7887, 1524, 2056, 1996, 10488, 3211, 1999, 19777, 1997, 2010, 7327, 8458, 23238, 10074, 5549, 1997, 4769, 1012, 2178, 1997, 2122, 4486, 2001, 1523, 8915, 10488, 3211, 6904, 27052, 6790, 5283, 1524, 1010, 1523, 1996, 3571, 1011, 4786, 2708, 1524, 1012, 2002, 2001, 5240, 2004, 16552, 3625, 2005, 12642, 1998, 8505, 1010, 2029, 2001, 3303, 2011, 1996, 12542, 1997, 2010, 3095, 2004, 2002, 2939, 2083, 1996, 17223, 18856, 20097, 2075, 2009, 2013, 2217, 2000, 2217, 1998, 2437, 1996, 2057, 13687, 2378, 24501, 28819, 1012, 2010, 4963, 2001, 3373, 2000, 2022, 6659, 1012, 2002, 2071, 2058, 2860, 24546, 2019, 25042, 2011, 8478, 2032, 2030, 2010, 2155, 2007, 15556, 1998, 2331, 1012, 2002, 2071, 8479, 1996, 2878, 2479, 2007, 14734, 1010, 1037, 7064, 2030, 20739, 9463, 5897, 1012, 2348, 2002, 2001, 1996, 4054, 12764, 1997, 1996, 10556, 8873, 2912, 6338, 2894, 1010, 2002, 2001, 8615, 102]}, {"score": 0.929276704788208, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "The chief of Nga Ravenga had married a daughter of the Ariki Kafika (which daughter is not stated), and to her father she fled when her husband was killed.

The child was protected by his grandfather who named him \u201cFakaarofatia\u201d, \u201cOrphaned\u201d. Soon after his arrival the portion of flesh was still hanging up outside the house, and from it the fat dripped, making a little pool on the ground. The infant, crawling about, strayed that way. It dabbled its fingers in the liquid, then sucked them.

Immediately the boys enter the house coils of sinnet cord and paddles are pushed out from beneath the caves to the tuatina . Food from the oven of the morning is brought up too and laid outside for them. In this case Pa Niukapu and others protested and ordered a portion to be divided off for the parents of the boys. The paddles and sinnet cord are apportioned by the principal mother's brother--Pa Niukapu in this case. He takes the coils of cord, about twenty in number, with a paddle, a cylinder of turmeric, and some fish-hooks. To the more important relatives he offers a choice; to the more distant he hands out a particular item. He insists that each person shall go away with his or her sinnet cord. Women are frustrated in their efforts to hand over to others coils they have been given. \u201cEach of you speak for a coil of sinnet for herself,\u201d said Nau Niukapu to the women near her. It is intended that each person of the far tuatina shall receive a gift. He or she goes home, observes it closely, and next day returns with a coil of identical type which is handed in to the father of the boy as a return gift. In each case the binding cord of the coil is different--fish-line, hibiscus, a strip of rau fara, rauparon, siri futi , a piece of net or a hank of grass. This enables the authorship of each coil to be known and reciprocity to be made exact by the boy's father, through whose hands the property passes. The sinnet and paddles are the only goods reciprocated. Fish-hooks are given free. At the initiation of Munakina, Seremata, at the instance of the father, the mission teacher, proceeded to give out two fish hooks to each person of the general crowd who had witnessed the ceremony outside. This was liberality to gain a reputation. Sometimes a man will refuse to go outside in order not to increase the liability of the father; those who stay inside get no presents.

It is a frequent practice of the Tikopia in re-furbishing the graves of their ancestors to bring a basket or two of white coral sand from the beach and spread it on top to give the 1 1 [See p.p. 170-171, Cat.116 -- Analyst] place of burial a neat and cleanly appearance. In the case of the Kafika temple this has been elevated into a ritual procedure, surrounded with severe tapu. In the monsoon season a dozen women, of Kafika or married out of that clan, assembled at the time when the sun was low over the western hill crest and proceeded to Potu sa Kafika, where they each plaited a small basket from fresh coconut leaf. They then set out when the sun had disappeared behind the hills, going in single file along the beach path round the bluff of Fongo-te-Koro till they reached the level expanse of Namo. Arrived at Suakava, the canoe yard of the sacred vessel of the Ariki Tafua, they halted and spread out in line along the edge of the beach, where the low bank of coral boulders met the sand. Facing up towards the canoe shed they sat down in groups of three or four and scooped out several large holes with their hands. It is from this that the rite takes its name. The sand taken out was used to fill the baskets. While this was in progress no one approached them or called out to them nor did they chatter among themselves, save to pass the few necessary comments on their work. For a man, in particular, to have interfered with them would have been the gravest breach of religious etiquette; I received permission to observe the proceedings only on condition that I did not set foot on the canoe ground and made no attempt to talk with the women -- conditions which of course I kept. he would be certain, according to the natives, to have brought on himself death, or at the least severe illness. When the baskets were full the women rose all together and walked in single file up to the canoe shed, where they stood for a moment. A man of Kafika clan approached the leading girl in the line and silently handed her a large met, then retired without a word. She advanced to the canoe shed, laid down the met, and set her basket upon it, after which the other baskets were passed to her along the line and stacked in one by one. This was done deliberately without haste. Another mat was laid on top covering the heap, and the women then withdrew, as they came, in single file, and walked off the canoe ground. Then they sat down in a group and discussed where they would spend the night. They could elect to sleep together in a single house, or go each to her own dwelling. The decision was specifically stated by the men to be taken upon their personal preference. A reasonable interpretation seems to be that the traditional privilege of spending the night together undisturbed emphasises their exclusiveness, increases the amount of public attention given to them, and to some extent allows them an assertion of their female group independence.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1999, 1996, 3944, 4158, 2028, 1997, 2216, 23273, 2838, 1997, 1996, 8887, 2006, 2029, 1996, 12493, 3209, 2293, 2000, 23120, 1999, 21283, 1011, 1011, 8915, 2004, 5575, 2050, 2028, 1010, 1996, 23348, 2075, 1997, 1996, 5472, 1012, 2009, 2003, 1037, 6976, 3218, 1997, 1996, 14841, 3683, 19312, 1999, 2128, 1011, 6519, 18477, 12053, 1996, 9729, 1997, 2037, 10748, 2000, 3288, 1037, 10810, 2030, 2048, 1997, 2317, 11034, 5472, 2013, 1996, 3509, 1998, 3659, 2009, 2006, 2327, 2000, 2507, 1996, 1015, 1015, 1031, 2156, 1052, 1012, 1052, 1012, 10894, 1011, 18225, 1010, 4937, 1012, 12904, 1011, 1011, 12941, 1033, 2173, 1997, 8940, 1037, 15708, 1998, 4550, 2135, 3311, 1012, 1999, 1996, 2553, 1997, 1996, 10556, 8873, 2912, 3379, 2023, 2038, 2042, 8319, 2046, 1037, 8887, 7709, 1010, 5129, 2007, 5729, 11112, 2226, 1012, 1999, 1996, 19183, 2161, 1037, 6474, 2308, 1010, 1997, 10556, 8873, 2912, 2030, 2496, 2041, 1997, 2008, 6338, 1010, 9240, 2012, 1996, 2051, 2043, 1996, 3103, 2001, 2659, 2058, 1996, 2530, 2940, 11146, 1998, 8979, 2000, 8962, 2226, 7842, 10556, 8873, 2912, 1010, 2073, 2027, 2169, 20228, 4886, 3064, 1037, 2235, 10810, 2013, 4840, 16027, 7053, 1012, 2027, 2059, 2275, 2041, 2043, 1996, 3103, 2018, 5419, 2369, 1996, 4564, 1010, 2183, 1999, 2309, 5371, 2247, 1996, 3509, 4130, 2461, 1996, 14441, 1997, 1042, 5063, 2080, 1011, 8915, 1011, 12849, 3217, 6229, 2027, 2584, 1996, 2504, 22944, 1997, 15125, 2080, 1012, 3369, 2012, 10514, 11905, 3567, 1010, 1996, 14347, 4220, 1997, 1996, 6730, 6258, 1997, 1996, 10488, 3211, 11937, 11263, 2050, 1010, 2027, 12705, 1998, 3659, 2041, 1999, 2240, 2247, 1996, 3341, 1997, 1996, 3509, 1010, 2073, 1996, 2659, 2924, 1997, 11034, 22177, 2777, 1996, 5472, 1012, 5307, 2039, 2875, 1996, 14347, 8328, 2027, 2938, 2091, 1999, 2967, 1997, 2093, 2030, 2176, 1998, 20804, 2041, 2195, 2312, 8198, 2007, 2037, 2398, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2013, 2023, 2008, 1996, 14034, 3138, 2049, 2171, 1012, 1996, 5472, 2579, 2041, 2001, 2109, 2000, 6039, 1996, 25946, 1012, 2096, 2023, 2001, 1999, 5082, 2053, 2028, 5411, 2068, 2030, 2170, 2041, 2000, 2068, 4496, 2106, 2027, 24691, 2426, 3209, 1010, 3828, 2000, 3413, 1996, 2261, 4072, 7928, 2006, 2037, 2147, 1012, 2005, 1037, 2158, 1010, 1999, 3327, 1010, 2000, 2031, 28976, 2007, 2068, 2052, 2031, 2042, 1996, 9729, 2102, 12510, 1997, 3412, 3802, 7413, 4674, 1025, 1045, 2363, 6656, 2000, 11949, 1996, 8931, 2069, 2006, 4650, 2008, 1045, 2106, 2025, 2275, 3329, 2006, 1996, 14347, 2598, 1998, 2081, 2053, 3535, 2000, 2831, 2007, 1996, 2308, 1011, 1011, 3785, 2029, 1997, 2607, 1045, 2921, 1012, 2002, 2052, 2022, 3056, 1010, 2429, 2000, 1996, 12493, 1010, 2000, 2031, 2716, 2006, 2370, 2331, 1010, 2030, 2012, 1996, 2560, 5729, 7355, 1012, 2043, 1996, 25946, 2020, 2440, 1996, 2308, 3123, 2035, 2362, 1998, 2939, 1999, 2309, 5371, 2039, 2000, 1996, 14347, 8328, 1010, 2073, 2027, 2768, 2005, 1037, 2617, 1012, 1037, 2158, 1997, 10556, 8873, 2912, 6338, 5411, 1996, 2877, 2611, 1999, 1996, 2240, 1998, 8601, 4375, 2014, 1037, 2312, 2777, 1010, 2059, 3394, 2302, 1037, 2773, 1012, 2016, 3935, 2000, 1996, 14347, 8328, 1010, 4201, 2091, 1996, 102]}, {"score": 0.9665248990058899, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "At Takarito stood the dwelling house of the chief of Nga Faea, close beside the dancing ground, and when the last chief abandoned the lands of his fathers he sent a message to the Ariki Kafika to come and occupy the site, use the food of the adjoining orchard, and perform the ceremonies to the gods. For in addition to its importance as a \u201chistorical\u201d relic, Takarito has yet another claim upon the interest of the people. There, on the site of the ancient house lies the Atua i Takarito, a deity of the most sacred character. He is the abandoned god of the vanished chiefs of Nga Faea, and it is on his behalf that the Ariki Kafika concludes the ceremonial season with the \u201ccarpeting\u201d of Takarito. The atua is embodied in a stone, round and heavy, which is kept covered by cycas leaves and a coconut mat. 2 The account given of this rite by Rivers, H.M.S. I, 338-9, is the first record of it, but contains many inaccuracies of detail. It was based on the description of a Motlav teacher, Ernest Wirit, who had not seen the ceremony, but had been told about it by a Tikopia. It is tapu to disturb this stone or even to look upon it at unauthorised times, and tales are related of how even in recent years inquisitive people have suffered for their temerity. A decade or so ago, so I was told, two girls who were out in the woods were led by curiosity to tamper with its coverings, and one of them even dared to touch the stone with her foot. The girls went home, and soon after they became ill. The one who had been most forward in meddling with the stone died, the other recovered, but with a diseased leg from which she still suffers. More recently, since the establishment of Christianity in Faea, one man in his zeal for the new faith, and contempt for the old, ventured to tamper with the deity. He took it out of its wrappings and rolled it away, some little distance. Then he went away, but told no-one. Later Pa Fangatoto, a man of the \u201chouse\u201d of Siku, the members of which are descended from the forme r chiefs of Nga Faea, and who consequently have a proprietary interest in their atua, found what had happened and hastened to report the sacrilege to the Ariki Kafika, not daring himself to touch the stone. The Ariki came, in great anger at the disturbance of the sacred relic, and replaced it. He complained to the native missionary teacher, a Motlav man, of the lack of toleration which the new converts displayed and prophesied evil would come upon them. The offender had been accused of the deed but denied having taken any part in it. Not long afterwards, however, he became afflicted with frightful yaws in the arm, rendering it useless. In the eyes of the Ariki Kafika, who told me the story, and of many other people, Christian as well as pagan, this was his punishment.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 2012, 27006, 8486, 3406, 2768, 1996, 13160, 2160, 1997, 1996, 2708, 1997, 12835, 2050, 17282, 2050, 1010, 2485, 3875, 1996, 5613, 2598, 1010, 1998, 2043, 1996, 2197, 2708, 4704, 1996, 4915, 1997, 2010, 11397, 2002, 2741, 1037, 4471, 2000, 1996, 10488, 3211, 10556, 8873, 2912, 2000, 2272, 1998, 11494, 1996, 2609, 1010, 2224, 1996, 2833, 1997, 1996, 13562, 15623, 1010, 1998, 4685, 1996, 10912, 2000, 1996, 5932, 1012, 2005, 1999, 2804, 2000, 2049, 5197, 2004, 1037, 1523, 3439, 1524, 24933, 1010, 27006, 8486, 3406, 2038, 2664, 2178, 4366, 2588, 1996, 3037, 1997, 1996, 2111, 1012, 2045, 1010, 2006, 1996, 2609, 1997, 1996, 3418, 2160, 3658, 1996, 2012, 6692, 1045, 27006, 8486, 3406, 1010, 1037, 12764, 1997, 1996, 2087, 6730, 2839, 1012, 2002, 2003, 1996, 4704, 2643, 1997, 1996, 9955, 9058, 1997, 12835, 2050, 17282, 2050, 1010, 1998, 2009, 2003, 2006, 2010, 6852, 2008, 1996, 10488, 3211, 10556, 8873, 2912, 14730, 1996, 12961, 2161, 2007, 1996, 1523, 10135, 2075, 1524, 1997, 27006, 8486, 3406, 1012, 1996, 2012, 6692, 2003, 25405, 1999, 1037, 2962, 1010, 2461, 1998, 3082, 1010, 2029, 2003, 2921, 3139, 2011, 22330, 15671, 3727, 1998, 1037, 16027, 13523, 1012, 1016, 1996, 4070, 2445, 1997, 2023, 14034, 2011, 5485, 1010, 1044, 1012, 1049, 1012, 1055, 1012, 1045, 1010, 27908, 1011, 1023, 1010, 2003, 1996, 2034, 2501, 1997, 2009, 1010, 2021, 3397, 2116, 27118, 9468, 4648, 9243, 1997, 6987, 1012, 2009, 2001, 2241, 2006, 1996, 6412, 1997, 1037, 9587, 19646, 11431, 3836, 1010, 8471, 15536, 14778, 1010, 2040, 2018, 2025, 2464, 1996, 5103, 1010, 2021, 2018, 2042, 2409, 2055, 2009, 2011, 1037, 14841, 3683, 19312, 1012, 2009, 2003, 11112, 2226, 2000, 22995, 2023, 2962, 2030, 2130, 2000, 2298, 2588, 2009, 2012, 14477, 14317, 21239, 2098, 2335, 1010, 1998, 7122, 2024, 3141, 1997, 2129, 2130, 1999, 3522, 2086, 1999, 15549, 28032, 3512, 2111, 2031, 4265, 2005, 2037, 8915, 5017, 3012, 1012, 1037, 5476, 2030, 2061, 3283, 1010, 2061, 1045, 2001, 2409, 1010, 2048, 3057, 2040, 2020, 2041, 1999, 1996, 5249, 2020, 2419, 2011, 10628, 2000, 17214, 4842, 2007, 2049, 5266, 2015, 1010, 1998, 2028, 1997, 2068, 2130, 15048, 2000, 3543, 1996, 2962, 2007, 2014, 3329, 1012, 1996, 3057, 2253, 2188, 1010, 1998, 2574, 2044, 2027, 2150, 5665, 1012, 1996, 2028, 2040, 2018, 2042, 2087, 2830, 1999, 19960, 14423, 2007, 1996, 2962, 2351, 1010, 1996, 2060, 6757, 1010, 2021, 2007, 1037, 4295, 2094, 4190, 2013, 2029, 2016, 2145, 17567, 1012, 2062, 3728, 1010, 2144, 1996, 5069, 1997, 7988, 1999, 17282, 2050, 1010, 2028, 2158, 1999, 2010, 27838, 2389, 2005, 1996, 2047, 4752, 1010, 1998, 17152, 2005, 1996, 2214, 1010, 20510, 2000, 17214, 4842, 2007, 1996, 12764, 1012, 2002, 2165, 2009, 2041, 1997, 2049, 12252, 2015, 1998, 4565, 2009, 2185, 1010, 2070, 2210, 3292, 1012, 2059, 2002, 2253, 2185, 1010, 2021, 2409, 2053, 1011, 2028, 1012, 2101, 6643, 15197, 10610, 3406, 1010, 1037, 2158, 1997, 1996, 1523, 2160, 1524, 1997, 9033, 5283, 1010, 1996, 2372, 1997, 2029, 2024, 9287, 2013, 1996, 2433, 2063, 1054, 9058, 1997, 12835, 2050, 17282, 2050, 1010, 1998, 2040, 8821, 2031, 1037, 16350, 3037, 1999, 2037, 2012, 6692, 1010, 2179, 102]}, {"score": 0.9635699987411499, "actual_label": 1, "passage": "But the most interesting point remains.

The reason given is that the massage practised on the expectant mother some time before makes the afterbirth fall into a position easy for subsequent expulsion. This is the \u201cturning of the child\u201d already mentioned. The afterbirth of male children is buried at once outside the eave on the non-sacred ( tuamu ) side of the house. That of female children is left until the morning\u2014assuming that the birth takes place at night. Then it is observed that certain objects are present in the afterbirth; sometimes there are two, sometimes three, or even four; they are described as being sometimes pale, but more often black, and they move and crawl within the placenta. These are removed and buried separately. They are described as uruuru atua , manifestations of a supernatural being, and are said to be that of Feke, the Octopus Deity. If they were buried with the afterbirth they would affect the health of the child. It would either die or become insane. This precaution applies only to girl children because Feke the atua is noted for his lubricity. (The theme of heterosexual intercourse with supernatural beings resulting in the illness of mortals runs through many Tikopia customs.)

This is done by the women of the household where the birth takes place\u2014in this case in that of the woman's father\u2014and is a mark of attention, one might almost say of honour. Turmeric is used on many occasions in Tikopia to single out individuals who are at the moment of especial social interest and importance. Following on the fakame\u03b7a ceremony comes the asi\u03b7a , which consists in the application by ope of the fare nana of turmeric to the senior woman of the fare masikita\u03b7a. Another application to a different member of this group is of precisely the same kind, the two ceremonies being differentiated in hardly more than name. The latter is called te ama fanau\u03b7a. On the occasion of the accouchement of Nau Taitai it was performed by Nau Ra\u03b7ivete upon Nau Fenuato. About the asi\u03b7a there was some debate. The fare nana said that the turmeric should be rubbed on the sister of Pa Taitai, but her mother objected. \u201cLet it not be put on the daughter,\u201d she said, and selected the eldest daughter of Pa Pa\u03b7isi instead. This was largely by way of paying a compliment to the social status of the leading mission teacher. The girl at first objected strenuously to being the recipient of this somewhat embarrassing honour, but at length submitted. Again Nau Ra\u03b7ivete acted as operator, being the sister of Nau Taitai. As soon as the bedaubing commenced the girl lowered her head and began to wail a dirge, as is the custom. In this case it was a dirge of the grandfather, most appropriate under the circumstances as being of a neutral order, having no direct reference to the relative kin status of any persons present. The object of these two ceremonial acts is said by the Tikopia to be the maintenance of the health of the child\u2014it must be remembered that turmeric is associated with the Atua i Kafika, and its use is pleasing to him. \u201cThe ama fanau\u03b7a is made that the babe may sleep well,\u201d it is said; \u201cthe asi\u03b7a has the same basis, the child. They have one basis.\u201d The differentiation between these two ceremonies is a product of multiplication of effort, not of any deep functional separation. But one very obvious sociological function is the overt offering of tokens of respect by close mother's kin of the infant to close father's kin.

If his body was not hale, then he could not serve efficiently as a representative of his people and a medium for his gods. This was exemplified by an Ariki Kafika, Pepe, about nine generations ago, according to tradition. 3 See We, The Tikopia, Genealogy I, p. 397. History and Traditions in Tikopia. He was said to have been afficted with severe yaws (framboesia), and therefore to have abdicated in favour of his younger brother, Tuisifo. In comment on this story, one of the senior men of rank in Kafika said, \u201cIf a chief dwells and contracts yaws, then he is put on one side to the rear. He is taken to the rear since he has become bad. Even while the yaws is slight he goes to the rear, because it is an evil thing. When the yaws stands in (the body of) a chief, it is the doing of the gods. It is bad, therefore is set to one side that another chief that is good may be taken.\u201d The underlying reason for this setting of a chief aside in Tikopia belief was not that the disease itself was physically contaminating or ritually destructive, but that it was a manifestation of the displeasure of the gods towards the chief. There was a suspicion that he had done something wrong. In any case, his power with the gods must have been ineffective, otherwise he would not be suffering. Yet such a general principle was not necessarily carried out in practice. The Ariki Fangarere in 1929, an elderly man, had been afflicted with a debilitating tropical ulcer in his foot for a number of years, but he still carried on his duties as chief, and I heard no suggestion that he ought to retire. He himself had not expressed any wish to abdicate. This may have been due to the fact that he was extremely active in economic and ritual affairs despite his lameness. Occasionally a concession was made to him as when, during the rites of the Work of the Gods, he came by canoe over the lake instead of walking round the shore with his co-chiefs. As I saw in 1952, such a concession could also be made to a chief on account of the weakness of old age. The affliction of the Ariki Fangarere was treated, then, rather as weakness than as fault. Yet that weakness of old age of the Ariki Kafika was regarded as deleterious to the welfare and prosperity of the land was borne out by opinions in 1952. 4 Reymond Firth. \u201cSome Principles of Social Organization,\u201d Journal Royal Anthropological Institute, Vol. LXXXV, 1955. pp. 9-10.", "predicted_label": 1, "input_ids": [101, 1997, 1996, 2060, 11647, 2008, 2020, 6303, 1997, 1037, 2708, 1010, 2028, 2001, 3558, 2740, 1012, 2065, 2010, 2303, 2001, 2025, 13084, 1010, 2059, 2002, 2071, 2025, 3710, 18228, 2004, 1037, 4387, 1997, 2010, 2111, 1998, 1037, 5396, 2005, 2010, 5932, 1012, 2023, 2001, 28593, 2011, 2019, 10488, 3211, 10556, 8873, 2912, 1010, 27233, 2063, 1010, 2055, 3157, 8213, 3283, 1010, 2429, 2000, 4535, 1012, 1017, 2156, 2057, 1010, 1996, 14841, 3683, 19312, 1010, 26684, 1045, 1010, 1052, 1012, 4464, 2581, 1012, 2381, 1998, 7443, 1999, 14841, 3683, 19312, 1012, 2002, 2001, 2056, 2000, 2031, 2042, 21358, 8873, 10985, 2007, 5729, 8038, 9333, 1006, 25312, 13344, 2229, 2401, 1007, 1010, 1998, 3568, 2000, 2031, 19935, 17872, 1999, 7927, 1997, 2010, 3920, 2567, 1010, 10722, 17417, 14876, 1012, 1999, 7615, 2006, 2023, 2466, 1010, 2028, 1997, 1996, 3026, 2273, 1997, 4635, 1999, 10556, 8873, 2912, 2056, 1010, 1523, 2065, 1037, 2708, 23120, 2015, 1998, 8311, 8038, 9333, 1010, 2059, 2002, 2003, 2404, 2006, 2028, 2217, 2000, 1996, 4373, 1012, 2002, 2003, 2579, 2000, 1996, 4373, 2144, 2002, 2038, 2468, 2919, 1012, 2130, 2096, 1996, 8038, 9333, 2003, 7263, 2002, 3632, 2000, 1996, 4373, 1010, 2138, 2009, 2003, 2019, 4763, 2518, 1012, 2043, 1996, 8038, 9333, 4832, 1999, 1006, 1996, 2303, 1997, 1007, 1037, 2708, 1010, 2009, 2003, 1996, 2725, 1997, 1996, 5932, 1012, 2009, 2003, 2919, 1010, 3568, 2003, 2275, 2000, 2028, 2217, 2008, 2178, 2708, 2008, 2003, 2204, 2089, 2022, 2579, 1012, 1524, 1996, 10318, 3114, 2005, 2023, 4292, 1997, 1037, 2708, 4998, 1999, 14841, 3683, 19312, 6772, 2001, 2025, 2008, 1996, 4295, 2993, 2001, 8186, 9530, 15464, 19185, 2030, 8887, 2135, 15615, 1010, 2021, 2008, 2009, 2001, 1037, 24491, 1997, 1996, 28606, 1997, 1996, 5932, 2875, 1996, 2708, 1012, 2045, 2001, 1037, 10928, 2008, 2002, 2018, 2589, 2242, 3308, 1012, 1999, 2151, 2553, 1010, 2010, 2373, 2007, 1996, 5932, 2442, 2031, 2042, 20694, 1010, 4728, 2002, 2052, 2025, 2022, 6114, 1012, 2664, 2107, 1037, 2236, 6958, 2001, 2025, 9352, 3344, 2041, 1999, 3218, 1012, 1996, 10488, 3211, 15197, 12069, 2890, 1999, 4612, 1010, 2019, 9750, 2158, 1010, 2018, 2042, 21358, 29301, 2098, 2007, 1037, 2139, 14454, 16518, 5133, 17359, 17119, 1999, 2010, 3329, 2005, 1037, 2193, 1997, 2086, 1010, 2021, 2002, 2145, 3344, 2006, 2010, 5704, 2004, 2708, 1010, 1998, 1045, 2657, 2053, 10293, 2008, 2002, 11276, 2000, 11036, 1012, 2002, 2370, 2018, 2025, 5228, 2151, 4299, 2000, 19935, 24695, 1012, 2023, 2089, 2031, 2042, 2349, 2000, 1996, 2755, 2008, 2002, 2001, 5186, 3161, 1999, 3171, 1998, 8887, 3821, 2750, 2010, 20342, 2791, 1012, 5681, 1037, 16427, 2001, 2081, 2000, 2032, 2004, 2043, 1010, 2076, 1996, 17105, 1997, 1996, 2147, 1997, 1996, 5932, 1010, 2002, 2234, 2011, 14347, 2058, 1996, 2697, 2612, 1997, 3788, 2461, 1996, 5370, 2007, 2010, 2522, 1011, 9058, 1012, 2004, 1045, 2387, 1999, 3999, 1010, 2107, 1037, 16427, 2071, 2036, 2022, 2081, 2000, 1037, 2708, 2006, 4070, 1997, 1996, 11251, 1997, 2214, 2287, 1012, 1996, 21358, 29301, 3258, 1997, 1996, 10488, 3211, 15197, 12069, 2890, 2001, 5845, 1010, 2059, 1010, 2738, 2004, 11251, 2084, 2004, 102]}, {"score": 0.8642477989196777, "actual_label": 0, "passage": "The Chukchi know practically no jewelry except glass beads.

The distance to Teriem's was only about twenty-five miles, and many of our friends with whom we had travelled from Aion lived over there, so the next morning I told Gregory that I wanted to drive to some of these friends in order to be present at the funeral of Teriem's wife. But Gregory and Kaankalj had all kinds of silly objections. At last they explained that it was impossible for me to drive alone because the one who arrives alone at a tent in which there is a corpse runs a great 134 risk of taking ill. To be safe, all three of us would have to go together, but this would be intruding for we were not related to the dead. In fact, it would be doubly intruding for us to go, because we should have to stay for several days.

They drink tea in large quantities three or four times daily, sometimes as much as forty large cups a day; but it does not seem to affect their nervous system. This is due to the fact that compressed tea, being prepared of the refuse leaves mixed with sheep or ox blood, contains but small quantities of the alkaloid. Europeans travelling in that country generally consume nearly as much tea without ill effects. Tea is considered by the people as a substitute for food. Its chief importance, however, is that it presents an excellent means of restoring heat after travelling or walking out of doors in the cold. It is considered to be healthy; and the natives believe that in the summer-time, when camping on the damp tundra, plenty of hot strong tea keeps off cold and fever.
