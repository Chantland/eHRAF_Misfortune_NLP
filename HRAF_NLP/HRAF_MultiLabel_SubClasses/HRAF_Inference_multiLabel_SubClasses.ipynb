In the winter of 1915 a Puivlik Eskimo named Wikkiak and the little boy Haugak were both ill at the same time. Wikkiak recovered soon after I visited their settlement, whereupon a shaman announced that his soul had been carried away by the shade of a dead man, but that my dog Jumbo had brought it back. Higilak therefore tied a strip of white deerskin round Jumbo's neck, thinking that perhaps he might be grateful for its warmth and bring back Haugak's soul also. The boy recovered, but a few months later Higilak fell ill herself, and Jumbo had to come to the rescue once again. In the eyes of the Eskimos he was clearly not an ordinary dog, but possessed an unusual amount of vital force. On this occasion, therefore, Higilak rubbed his saliva over her forehead in order that some of this force might enter into her and overcome her sickness. Jumbo's reward was another neckband of white deerskin.”\",\n",

The shaman then has to extract the object, which he does by the aid of his familiar spirits. To prove his success he displays to his audiences pieces of bone, or worms, or similar things that he has secreted on his person before-hand. The laxatives that we occasionally administered answered the same purpose. Both sickness and ill-luck can be embodied in physical objects and carried away. Haviuyak had a boil on his arm which he pricked with a needle as soon as it came to a head, squeezing the pus on to a piece of caribou meat. He asked me to let him give it to Scotty, the biggest dog in my team, who would carry the contagion away with him when I left. One of his own dogs snatched at the meat, but he kicked it away and anxiously watched till the whole morsel had disappeared down Scotty's throat. To propitiate the dog he tied a band of white deerskin round its neck. Some days later he was asked how the boil was progressing, and answered, ‘It has all disappeared, thanks to the dog.’ Another Eskimo, Kaiyoranna, made me a present of two bone pins fastened to the outside of a small deerskin bag. I wanted to look inside the bag, but he checked me and tried to draw my attention to the fine workmanship in the pins. Later, after I had left the camp, I found only four old scraps of skin in the bag. I showed it to some of the natives, and they explained that Kaiyoranna had fastened some one's illness or ill-luck in the bag, and added the pins as a bribe to induce me to take it away.”\",\n",

Sunburn hardly seemed credible when the temperature of the atmosphere remained constantly below the freezing-point; but the sun now shone throughout the twenty-four hours of the day, and its light was doubled by reflection from the snow. So man, like the animals, changed his colour with the season. The faces of the Eskimos during the dark days of winter had been as fair as an Englishman's; now they were tanned to the deep rich brown of a southern European.

That she failed to cure me distressed but did not surprise her, for, as she herself remarked, Eskimo remedies had no efficacy with white men. She showed her sympathy in a more practical manner by giving me the choicest morsels of fish, and by foraging far and wide for dryads in order to cook more frequently. Yet in spite of all her efforts my health failed to improve, and at last I sent The Runner to the Lake of Dancing to bring me a few ounces of malted milk and three pounds of dog-pemmican that I had stored there in a cache. The malted milk lasted me two days, after which I began on the pemmican, prepared forty years earlier for the fur posts of the Hudson's Bay Trading Company. It was brown with antiquity, and consisted merely of dried beef crushed to powder, with here and there fragments of bones; but mixed into a paste with cold water it was more digestible than the half-raw fish on the drying-poles, and more palatable than saltless fish boiled over a smoky flame in a cupful of water. So for a week I ate nothing but pemmican. Gradually the dysentery lessened, my strength began to return, and, though the intolerable thirst continued, there was hope of a permanent recovery if in some way we could improve our diet.\",\n",

He could understand my dislike of raw fish, but not its effect on my health, unless, indeed, my guardian spirit had forbidden its consumption. Yet he would gladly do anything to aid my recovery. It was the end of July; the fur of the caribou was in its prime, and the fishing season nearing its close. He had intended to pass the remainder of the summer wandering in the hills to the north-east, where caribou were numerous but fuel scarce; however, seeing that I might eat nothing but cooked food, we could move southward toward the coast if I wished, and travel over plains amply clothed with heather and willow. We agreed to adopt this second plan and communicated the decision to our companions.',\n",

He visited the harbour, where I had noticed some bearded seals playing in the open water near shore. It was not difficult to shoot them, but to bring them to land was an extremely hazardous enterprise, since a thin sheet of ice covered the water for a distance of a hundred yards out from the shore. Any dead seals that remained afloat, buoyed up by thick layers of blubber, drifted gently against its outer edge. Ikpuck crawled cautiously toward them, testing the ice in front of him with his hunting-knife; then, attaching a long line to a carcass, he retreated a few yards and dragged it out of the water. This was the most perilous task of all, and more than once the ice creaked ominously under the strain; but salt-water ice is less brittle than freshwater, and he escaped with nothing worse than two badly frozen wrists. Out of six seals that flated he landed three, which provided enough blubber to last us a month, even if we kept the lamp burning five or six hours a day. He did not mention the freezing of his wrists, and we did not discover their condition until they turned completely black.',\n",

The father, aided by an elderly medicine-man, set the leg in short splints bound round with a caribou hide. As soon as I heard of the accident I offered to take the lad to our station, where we would care for him until he could walk again; and the parents, who had often been our guests, gratefully accepted, on condition that the old medicine-man also gave his consent. When I asked them why they needed the medicineman's permission they told me that he had under-taken to effect a cure, provided he were given the boy in payment; and that they had consented, much against their will, lest the child should be crippled for life. They requested the old man to release them from the engagement, but he refused, not unnaturally, perhaps, since he hoped that the boy would support him in his declining years; and the parents dared not go back on their word for fear of the old man's witch-craft. So the boy did not return with me, but remained in the settlement; and though his leg healed rapidly, his family lost him for ever.\",\n",

He told me that one of the heads represented himself, and the other his ‘assistant’ in the blacksmith's craft. This ‘assistant,’ among other things, attended very carefully to securing prompt payment for the blacksmith's work. In the case of slow payments, he punished both the workman and the customer. He was apparently jealous because his activity as ‘assistant’ was slightingly treated: therefore he was angry with both parties. In one case, when the blacksmith failed to collect the fee for mending a kettle, the ‘assistant’ became so angry, that while the blacksmith was at work he jumped into his left eye in the form of a red spark. As a result, the eye was seriously hurt, and the dilatory customer was soon afterward stricken with palsy. 364 I bought the charm-string, with the image tied to it, from the blacksmith; but, after accepting the price, he said he would sleep over the absence of his charm, and see in his dreams during the first night whether the ‘assistant’ was angry with him over the transaction. The next morning, however, the blacksmith was taken suddenly ill with influenza, which at that time prevailed in the country, and within twenty-four hours he was dead. His neighbors firmly believed that his death was caused by the revengeful ‘assistant.’ The above story is a good illustration of the way in which the Chukchee invent their own particular ‘assistants,’ and of their ideas regarding them.”\",\n",

In the middle, three large shoals of fish, flocks of various sea-fowl, seal, and walrus are arranged somewhat symmetrically. A plank of the same provenience (Fig. 274, b) has a large seal-net spread on one end. A big shoal of fish and all kinds of game are represented moving towards the net. Killer-whales are charging a group of walruses. According to the explanation by the natives, they want to drive them into the net. Three boats are pursuing a whale. A man is dragging a seal, and 396 another one is paddling on a kayak. The part played by killer-whales is illustrated in a native sketch given before, ... where killer-whales make a similar attack on a shoal of walruses, while another killer-whale asks the paddlers of a boat for a little tobacco. The native artist evidently wished to represent the killer-whales as friendly to men, and as helping them in their hunt in exchange for a small sacrifice. The supernatural rôle ascribed to the killer-whale has been discussed previously. Fig. 275 is from the village of Nu'nligren. It is painted on both sides. The painting represents hunting-scenes. In one a man is shooting a seal with a rifle. The seal is surrounded by rough ice represented in four big heaps made by several concentric circular lines.\",\n",

Then the young men and girls, one by one, or in pairs consisting of a man and a woman, try their skill. For this, the performer plants himself firmly in the middle of the hide, and with a sudden jerk those who hold it send him upward, often to the height of five metres. After that involuntary jump, he falls back on the skin, and is safe from harm. The greatest skill is in coming down on the feet without losing one's equilibrium. Women are more clever than men at this, and there are those who can keep upright for three successive jumps. 411 The ‘tossing on walrus-hide’ often assumes the character of a contest, in which a prize is offered to the winner. Every one who has taken three jumps successfully may stop, and wait his turn to compete with a performer who has achieved a similar success. I was told by the people that the ‘tossing on walrus-hide’ is said to be copied from the ke'let [JMR: evil spirits], after a certain shaman had seen them perform this exercise.

The “windwomen” disturb a man in sleep by assuming the forms of alluring young women, usually a particular woman whom the man desires. She offers him tempting food, but if he eats this food he will sicken and perhaps die. Just as the “eating together” ceremony is symbolical of consummation in marriage, the eating of this food is apparently symbolical of sexual union and the man believes he has connection with the woman.

Her husband appealed to me to drive away the god or his wife's delusion. The Rev. John Hunt was staying with me at the time and we went together to the dwelling of the woman, he armed with a large dose of Epsom salts, and I with a bottle of spirits of hartshorn. On our arrival we found the house filled with people, and the woman on her back in the midst, shouting lustily, ‘Let me alone, that I may return!’ The excitement was very great, but the shouting was considerably checked by the sudden application of hartshorn to her nose. When a light was brought we discovered that our patient was by no means a Venus, which led Mr. Hunt to observe, with dry gravity, ‘Truly she is a beauty: what a fancy the god must have who can desire her!’ A burst of laughter from the spectators, in which the husband outlaughed the whole, followed this remark. The treatment was most successful. The woman's pride was so strong that she at once sat up, assuring us that the god had gone away, and that she needed no more medicine.” 59 Thomas Williams and J.

Three to six women blacken their iaces with ashes, especially the region around the eyes, as a protection from sun. Each woman takes a tatanga net, rolls it around two sticks, and carries it on her shoulder or in her hand. On Kambara the women use diving goggles, called suvimarini (submarine), which are said to have been introduced about ten years ago. The nets are unfolded on the beach. Women prefer to use the nets in water which is about neck high. One stick is held in either hand, the net is open, and the woman walks or dog paddles, watching the water. Suddenly she dives and makes a clever twist with the net. The fisherwoman comes to the surface, empties the net, kills the fish by biting its head, and puts it into the fish basket which is either tied to her waist or is standing on a rock nearby. If she is near the beach where the children are watching the fishing, she throws the fish onto the sand for them to kill. Frequently the children enter the water also and, while swimming toward the women, try to chase the fish into the nets by beating the surface. The tatanga is difficult work. For hours the women work in the glare of the sun and in the often cold salt water. The women say that when no protecting glasses were known the work was more difficult.',\n",

Special priests (wodadín) roam through the countryside, usually traveling through a region with a number of other priests, performing the functions of their office and lining their pockets in the process. They have no influence whatever on the people. Superstition flourishes in the most luxuriant forms, but I would say that even this has no significance whatever, because the natives content themselves entirely with copied amulets and the like. Belief in sorceresses ( komâju, sorceress) is to be encountered here and there since, after all, every old woman is surrounded by the aura of being able to perform sorcery. The Somâli swears an oath (dâr) on the Koran, and the Ogadên on the head of his children and wives. Breach of promise with respect to the Whites or the enemy, however, is no crime. The prayer times are those of all Islamites (9:30, súbbeh; noon, dóhur; 3:30, ássur; 6:30, mágrib; and eight o’clock, asâ ); they are observed only by the most pious. Attempts to convert the Somâl to the Christian religion have never been seriously undertaken. In Zeila, to be sure, a magnificent house has been built for the French Mission, but not in the hope of being able to win the Somâl for Christendom. The building is supposed to serve merely as a way station for missionaries going off to Galla country. The universal complaint is that the Somâli curtly turns away the European apostle of the faith and that, in view of the people’s nomadic way of life, the latter is unable to step in to civilize the natives by getting them in the habit of working regularly. None of the religious ideas of the Galla has been incorporated by the Somâl. Except to celebrate Ramadan there are no festive periods. I heard nothing about divine judgments among the western Somâl tribes. The times of year are mostly distinguished according to the rainy seasons in the manner already indicated, but between these there are also shorter periods ( bil, month) by which time is occasionally reckoned. Their names are not generally known ( 73 . The names of the months given by Haggenmacher, op. cit., p. 28, are not all known to the Ejssa, so I must assume that they are perhaps valid for only a small group of coastal inhabitants. The Êjssa and Hábr Auál use the following designations for the months: dúggo (November), bil dúrroh hôra (December), bil dúrroh dámba (January), rajâl hôra (February), rajâl dáha (March), rajâl dámba (April), sáboh (May), wa báris (June), sunkât (July), sunfûr (August), sid atâl (September), aráfo (October). ).',\n",

One of these parts, the noreshi , is capable of leaving the body; when it does so, the person becomes ill and dies unless it (the noreshi ) returns. The noreshi are inherited patrilineally for males and matrilineally for females. Each human noreshi has an animal or bird counterpart whose life is coextensive and coterminous with that of the human to which it corresponds. Many of the noreshi are types of animals commonly taken by hunters. Thus, when the Yanomaö kill game animals, they believe they also kill the human being to whom that noreshi corresponds. 1 They are not concerned about killing their own noreshi , for humans and their noreshi animals live in complementary distribution. Hence, hunting in the eyes of the Yanomaö is behaving fiercely, for every noreshi animal killed also results in the death of some human, usually an enemy.',\n",

She was believed to overcome men and generate children from them in the spirit world, with the result that they fell ill. Some time after I had returned to Tikopia in 1952 I was asked about my former illness and my ‘sons’ in the spirit world. Surprised, I made further enquiry and learnt that this was a widely believed view. Later a neighbour, Pa Ngatotiu, asked me if I wanted to talk to his deceased father, i.e. a spirit, and learn the names of my children in the spirit world.

For simplicity the rituals of conservation or increase there referred to (p. 170) have been included in this article under the heads of “magic” of protection and production. (This can be done since in a broad sense the aim of all magic is the increase, maintenance or decrease of resources, material or immaterial) Examples of the Tikopia “magic” of production are the formula for inducing plants to grow when they are set in the ground; the formulae for eatching fish. An example of the “magic” of protection is tying on of the ritualised Cordyline leaf necklet to preserve a person in good health. An example of the “magic” of destruction is sorcery directed against persons or food.',\n",
