       " 'passage': ['Occasional offerings are made in innumerable places along roads where the genii loci live, where there is a cave, a rock of extraordinary shape, or a spring of water. Approximately in the middle of the road between two towns, two cultivated fields, two rivers, hills, or lakes, there is always a stone in the road, sometimes literally covered with these offerings made by those who walk along these paths. Often the small bundles of maize leaves do not contain anything but the alúna of the offering which the traveler made when he passed through the place. Near these places they sometimes pull up green leaves and touch their thighs with them for a moment in order to absorb the fatigue. Then the leaf is placed upon the rock, and with it all of the tiredness of the traveler. Little piles of natural stones from 1 to 15 pounds in weight were explained to us as offerings “in order not to get tired” or for the fertility of the plantings of coca, which must be deposited on the ancient cultivation terraces ( 35 . If a man plants coca without having the appropriate sewá or without making the prescribed offerings, his family will become sick and his children “will have toothache.” ).',\n",
       "  \"In the strictest sense of the word, kwák tan is the designation for feeling pain, suffering, being indisposed, being sick. But to our Selk'nam a neat separation of the physical from the psychic pain matters very little: all suffering, especially the latter, causes him an unpleasant psychic condition, and he designates predominantly this discomfort, being depressed, being indisposed psychically , with kwák tan or sickness. The more comprehensive term kwáke is more in general use. The latter, however, considered as effect, in the above association of thought 756 means the same as kwák tan . (25) Other Feuerland /Tierra del Fuego/ travelers emphasize this abstract distinction little or not at all. Cf. Beauvoir (b):48, 127 and Tonelli:116.

On the other hand, k pá en means the use of ordinary remedies for injuries, etc., such as anyone can do.\",\n",
       "  'The Anadendron paniculatum is a plant from which the Andamanese obtain a valuable fibre, which they use for their bow-strings, and for thread with which to make their arrows and harpoons. A number of magical properties are attributed to this plant. Rheumatism is supposed to be due to the “smell” of the plant getting into the system when the fibre is being prepared 1 In preparing the fibre, the skin or bark of the young shoots of the plant is torn off in strips and these are placed on the thigh and scraped with a Cyrena shell. . The “smell” of the green plant, or of the fibre until it has been thoroughly dried for some days, is believed to frighten away turtle. A man who has been preparing the fibre would not dream of joining a turtle-hunting expedition, for his presence in the canoe would be sufficient to drive away all the turtle. A turtle-hunting expedition would be a failure if a piece of the green creeper were in the canoe. A man who has been handling the plant may not cook turtle, for the meat would be “bad,” i.e., uneatable. The same thing would happen if turtle meat accidentally came in contact with a piece of the plant. All this applies only to the green creeper, and not to the fibre after it has been properly prepared and dried. The fibre itself is used for binding the heads of turtle-harpoons, so it is evidently regarded as harmless.',\n",

He said: ‘Indeed, it was the canoe of the spirits--the spirit's name was Tereiteata--it is held to be their canoe.’ But he added: ‘It wasn't sorcery--it's not certain; I just don't know’, and he gave it as his opinion that it was the work of spirits only, and not a result of the action of the Ariki Tafua.\",\n",

Cf. my analysis of the economic aspects of ritual in Frimitive Polynesian Economy , 1939, Ch. V. For simplicity the rituals of conservation or increase there referred to (p. 170) have been included in this article under the heads of “magic” of protection and production. (This can be done since in a broad sense the aim of all magic is the increase, maintenance or decrease of resources, material or immaterial) Examples of the Tikopia “magic” of production are the formula for inducing plants to grow when they are set in the ground; the formulae for eatching fish. An example of the “magic” of protection is tying on of the ritualised Cordyline leaf necklet to preserve a person in good health. An example of the “magic” of destruction is sorcery directed against persons or food.',\n",
       "  'We first began to visit Sulaimani when he was twenty-five weeks old, although he had made several visits to the clinic before that. He wore a tiny pair of printed cotton trunks and had little bags of “medicine” slung across his naked torso. When we first arrived for our visit he sat quietly on the floor, looking about at us and chewing on a tin. Mrs. Kibuka held out her arms to invite him to come to her. He smiled and seemed eager to come. He accepted being held by her and cried when she put him down. She picked him up again, but he became restless sitting on her lap and began to fuss. Mrs. Kibuka handed him to his mother. He sat on his mother’s lap, sometimes fussing, sometimes merely vocalizing. Finally he began to cry in earnest. The cry turned into a tempery scream. His mother tried to soothe him, talking to him and rocking him. There was a perfunctory quality to her soothing, and before long she slung him over her back and rocked him there. This treatment did not quiet him, however, so finally she gave him the breast—he immediately stopped crying and began to suckle.',\n",

The Kicua call them Naccac and the Aymara, Khari Khari .

       "  \"The general impression given by the Finnish Lapps' original methods of curing is that they are comparatively manifold. Most cases are treated now with rational, now with magic remedies, even if the results are far from always being in accordance with expectations. Established Lapps have better opportunities to take care of the sick than do the nomadic Lapps in their inadequate cloth-huts. The reindeer-Lapps, owing to their migrations, are obliged to move their sick long distances in sleds, even when the ground is bare. Patients suffering from chronic diseases, as well as weak, aged people, are often placed by the reindeer-Lapps in families with permanent dwellings. -- Nowadays, when doctors, hospitals and pharmacies are closer than before, the old methods of curing are more and more tending to give way to modern therapeutics. 1 The Chapter “Diseases and Methods of Curing” is based, in addition to the sources in the afore-mentioned foot-notes, mainly on notes of the writer (see Die Heilkunde der Finnlandlappen, Mitteilungen des Vereins für Finnische Volkskunde, 1944-5) and on articles by P.

A simple line even, roughly stitched or cut through a piece of leather, and representing the mouth, is sufficient for an image of a ‘guardian.’ The mouth is considered the chief feature of the image, because it is needed for swallowing the sacrifice. Not infrequently the dog is represented by a small piece of wood or ivory with a head on each end (Fig. 259). The two heads are supposed to protect at the same time both the front and the rear.

While the dead are still known it is possible ritually to revive them as ancestors. A diviner may attribute a sickness or some other misfortune to the neglect of an ancestral spirit; the troublesome spirit is always one alive within a generation or two, usually one within living memory. These diviners, who mediate between the worlds of the living and the dead, are, like the priests, a class of initiates with a special skill or gift. So far as I know, they are always either spirit mediums possessed by gods able to describe the state of the soul in purgatory, or else shamans, usually women who travel in spirit to the other world, and known in Mountainstreet as khan-bong-hun , “drawer-up of dead souls.” Known but unworshipped, the dead are kui. Known and worshipped, they are ancestors.

       "  \"It will have been noted that a decrease in the “magic” of production is associated to some extent with the provision of an alternative, in the form of generalized prayers by mission teachers. This provision of alternative is seen more clearly with the “magic” of protection. In traditional Tikopia ritual the “magic” of protection is epitomised especially by the wearing of an oiled leaf circlet, put round the neck of a person by a chief or ritual elder with a formula for health and welfare. This is still done in pagan circles, and has the sociological function of serving as a demonstration of a ritual relation, and up to a point, a political relation between the person so invested and the man of rank. Practising Christians do not normally have such investment. But a similar function for them is fulfilled by the wearing of the Cross. Both it and the leaf necklet are described by the same general term feao , a ritually protective token. A conversation I had with two Christian lads in 1952 will illustrate the point. The Ariki Taumako, one of the three pagan chiefs, was about to hold an investiture one morning. I asked the lads if the leaf circlet was effective, was it “correct”? They answered that it was -- “the blocking of anything foolish”, i. e. of maleficient influences. “Then why don't you two go and get your circlets?” I asked ironically. “The dark crowd” -- i. e. it's a pagan affair. “Have you got your own protection then?” “Yes! the necklet of the Church.” The Cross on a chain round the neck was their feao , their spiritual protection against physical ills. Such a Cross can be made by anyone, they said, from the appropriate materials -- copper and a white metal such as aluminium or stainless steel. When it is made it does not need to be taken to be blessed by the priest; it is simply hung on the neck. But when the person goes to bathe, or to excrete, it should not be taken, but hung up in the house. If it should be taken to such contaminated places, ill results would occur.\",\n",

This, however, did not yet involve the full incidence of the inexorable fate which is the present lot of man; for old age, bodily decay, and debility do not spell death to the natives. In order to understand the full cycle of their beliefs it is necessary to study the factors of illness, decay, and death. The native of the Trobriands is definitely an optimist in his attitude to health and illness. Strength, vigour, and bodily perfection are to him the natural status which can only be affected or upset by an accident or by a supernatural cause. Small accidents such as excessive fatigue, sunstroke, over-eating, or exposure may cause minor and temporary ailments. By a spear in battle, by poison, by a fall from a rock or a tree a man may be maimed or killed. Whether these accidents and others, such as drowning and the attack of a crocodile or a shark, are entirely free from sorcery is ever a debatable question to a native. But there is no doubt whatever to him that all serious and especially all fatal illnesses are due to various forms and agencies of witchcraft. The most prevalent of these is the ordinary sorcery practised by wizards, who can produce by their spells and rites a number of ailments covering well nigh the whole domain of ordinary pathology, with the exception of very rapid fulminating diseases and epidemics.',\n",

Dreams, for instance, are the experiences of the semengat when, during sleep, it leaves the body and wanders abroad either ‘mundanely in the immediate neighbourhood or further afield in the perilous world of spirits ( antu )’ (Freeman 1967:316). On such occasions, the semengat can become lost or ensnared by a malevolent spirit. Thus, ‘the most common diagnosis of sickness among the Iban is that some misfortune has befallen the soul; as Manang Bungai expressed it: “at the first trace of illness, the soul is already wandering abroad” ( Sepi kitai tabin , lelang semengat )’ (Freeman 1967:316).

Careless handling of an axe must certainly result in a wound; failure to moor a canoe securely, at a time when the floods are rising, will most probably result in the disappearance of the canoe.

       "  'The curious term anea pariki may now be examined to see why it is that a rite of celebrating the firstfruits of fishing should be called “evil things”. The native explanation was that it represents an acknowledgment to the gods of the adze for their efforts on behalf of men.

But if men are slack, and either do not catch fish, or neglect to perform the appropriate rites with them, then the gods become angry. “Anea pariki maori soa E!” said the Ariki Kafika to me. “Evil things truly, friend. If there is no fish, it is made with a man, and the man dies. The man has been struck by the guardian deities of the adze that he may die for the making of their ‘evil things’”. If the anea pariki are not made for some days after the canoes have gone to sea, it is believed that some person will sicken and die; it is known then that the gods have taken their victim.

The object of these medicines is to insure the neophyte against harm from the violent leaps characteristic of the bori dance. They are administered during the first three days of the ritual, while the initiate is in seclusion with the “father” or “mother of the boiling.” During this period he is also taught the songs sung under possession, and the drum rhythms by which the spirits are called or rhythms played on the gàraya, a stringed instrument used mainly at these bori rites.

       "  \"The entrance of the house requires special attention, for certain important customs surround it. The doors are of heavy timbers, swinging on iron hinges, and, lacking a metal lock, are bolted at night with a heavy wooden bar which is kept in place by a second plece above it on a pivot. The outer doorway may have a fuel lamp for night and in many cases is furnished with oharms designed to ward off the evil eye, a belief which will be discussed in a later section. These are oharacteristically a blue porcelain plate, embedded in the mud wall-surfacing, or a pair of old shoes hung on a nail. The popular reasoning behind the second device is that it indicates to a person with the eye that “your malevolent glance is as powerful as our pair of old shoes,” an explanation that probably has little to do with the origin of the custom. Whenever the construction of a house is completed, the new owner sacrifices an animal, a sheep or a goat, by cutting its throat before the door and smears some of the blood on the doorposts and the threshhold. Often he dips his hand in the blood, and applies it to the door, making by its imprint the so-called “Hand of Fatima” (referred, almost certainly ex post facto , to the daughter of the Prophet), a symbol found in almost all parts of the Middle East, particularly in amulet jewelry. The same sacrifice is applied to new additions to the house, and, in case a new storey has been built, the throat of the animal is slit over a window sill. It will be seen that When a bride enters her new home, an animal is similarly slaughtered before the threshhold and the maiden's sandal is dipped in its blood. It is an incredible breach of etiquette, if not criminal, to enter a house without announcing oneself, a usage which is supposed to have an origin in the life of the Prophet, and custom demands that the visitor knock and wait outside until ushered in.

The second problem concerned what may be rather loosely indicated as the psycho-somatic aspects of the illness. Previously these appeared to be catered for fairly effectively by the spirit medium performances; what then could take their place? The Tikopia answer here was clear--the power of prayer.

Likewise it is the one in which aggressive performances are most likely to occur. 1 This interpretation would have it that aguardiente becomes a physical medium by means of which the anger of the witch is transmitted to his target. Most aguardiente I have drunk has swirling hair in it; so foreign substance is not uncommon and thus available for potential interpretation. To restate the matter slightly, we may say: there is a language of aguardiente which depends upon the visual cues in examining the liquid. It is a one information bit language. The bit reads: If the aguardiente is clear when one is offered a drink, drink it and thank the drinker. If the aguardiente is “swirling-hairful,” and one is offered a drink, break the glass or bottle and beat the offerer up. One general performance the drink pourer engages in on most occasions I have observed is as follows: He pours the drink into the shot glass, then examines the liquid to see if it is clean or not. If it is not clean, he will attempt to clean it by picking out the foreign substance (sticks, leaves, hair, dirt, etc.).

In the case of the Kafika temple this has been elevated into a ritual procedure, surrounded with severe tapu. In the monsoon season a dozen women, of Kafika or married out of that clan, assembled at the time when the sun was low over the western hill crest and proceeded to Potu sa Kafika, where they each plaited a small basket from fresh coconut leaf. They then set out when the sun had disappeared behind the hills, going in single file along the beach path round the bluff of Fongo-te-Koro till they reached the level expanse of Namo. Arrived at Suakava, the canoe yard of the sacred vessel of the Ariki Tafua, they halted and spread out in line along the edge of the beach, where the low bank of coral boulders met the sand. Facing up towards the canoe shed they sat down in groups of three or four and scooped out several large holes with their hands. It is from this that the rite takes its name. The sand taken out was used to fill the baskets. While this was in progress no one approached them or called out to them nor did they chatter among themselves, save to pass the few necessary comments on their work. For a man, in particular, to have interfered with them would have been the gravest breach of religious etiquette; I received permission to observe the proceedings only on condition that I did not set foot on the canoe ground and made no attempt to talk with the women -- conditions which of course I kept. he would be certain, according to the natives, to have brought on himself death, or at the least severe illness. When the baskets were full the women rose all together and walked in single file up to the canoe shed, where they stood for a moment. A man of Kafika clan approached the leading girl in the line and silently handed her a large met, then retired without a word. She advanced to the canoe shed, laid down the met, and set her basket upon it, after which the other baskets were passed to her along the line and stacked in one by one. This was done deliberately without haste. Another mat was laid on top covering the heap, and the women then withdrew, as they came, in single file, and walked off the canoe ground. Then they sat down in a group and discussed where they would spend the night. They could elect to sleep together in a single house, or go each to her own dwelling. The decision was specifically stated by the men to be taken upon their personal preference.

       "  'Disappointed at the non-appearance of the caribou, my versatile “father” sought by other means to replenish our dwindling stock of meat. He visited the harbour, where I had noticed some bearded seals playing in the open water near shore. It was not difficult to shoot them, but to bring them to land was an extremely hazardous enterprise, since a thin sheet of ice covered the water for a distance of a hundred yards out from the shore. Any dead seals that remained afloat, buoyed up by thick layers of blubber, drifted gently against its outer edge. Ikpuck crawled cautiously toward them, testing the ice in front of him with his hunting-knife; then, attaching a long line to a carcass, he retreated a few yards and dragged it out of the water. This was the most perilous task of all, and more than once the ice creaked ominously under the strain; but salt-water ice is less brittle than freshwater, and he escaped with nothing worse than two badly frozen wrists. Out of six seals that flated he landed three, which provided enough blubber to last us a month, even if we kept the lamp burning five or six hours a day.

       "  \"As the time for moving from their temporary villages to the eunoto site draws near, the manyat are joined by non-manyata moran and they migrate as a whole age-group. The apprehensiveness of sorcery surrounding this move helps to build up a sense of occasion. The eunoto site itself is kept secret so that it cannot be tampered with beforehand. A protective line of chalky ‘medicine’ provided by the Prophet is traced on every forehead from ear to ear for the move. There is also a false start to divert misfortune from the migration proper that follows. This is a theme that is repeated later that day with the installation of the ritual leader, for he too is thought to divert misfortune from his age mates who follow him to elderhood. This concern with threats from sinister forces coincides with the transformation that the age-group of moran undergo through eunoto . It marks an implicit shift in the distribution of power with age more generally. The juxtaposition of large numbers of older men and younger men sharply differentiated by age highlights their differences. The maturation of the moran is a fact of life that arouses ambivalence, clearly expressed in Episode 2 and other incidents of the kind. Even the firestick patrons, whose future is ritually linked with that of their moran wards, have a vested interest in delaying the reality of the present. This is to suggest that the kind of insight offered by some informants, that the danger from ‘eyes’ emanates from society at large, could logically be extended to interpreting the dangers that are felt to surround eunoto . Episode 4 . Seizing the ritual leaders . The migration to the eunoto site had to take place on the fifth day of a Maasai lunar month, reckoned from the morning when the old moon was no longer visible (24th April 1977). When the time came, moran feasting in the forest nearby were summoned and the number in the villages increased overnight from about 100 moran to perhaps 450. This was the first time that the whole age-group had ever been assembled in one spot. Forty-nine of the moran were selected to lead the procession. Singing emosiroi , they were followed by a herd of forty-eight white heifers and a young black bull, and then by all the other moran. They were blessed by a manyata-mother, who dipped a handful of grass into a milk gourd and flicked milk at them as they passed through her gateway and out of the larger village. This was the false start, and when all the moran had passed out, the patrons ordered them to disband. (Coining the metaphor, the ritual rebirth had been aborted.) The procession proper had to wait until the manyata-mothers packed their donkeys and had left to be at the eunoto site before the moran. During this lull, the patrons directed the moran to process between the villages performing their lion dance. Some patrons, who were trying to slow down the tempo, were visibly moved, two with tears down their cheeks. It was the lion dance, I was told, that stirred their memories - and it was being performed too fast. In other respects, the patrons clearly showed that they had total control and were determined to dominate this occasion. Throughout the day they marshalled the moran for instruction, for dancing, and for the chores of moving, and one or two lashed out with their long whips on impulse. The moran seemed drained of their earlier confidence, for the migration was a prelude to the evening climax when the identities of the ritual leader and his deputy would be revealed. Later, several moran described to me their feelings of apprehension on this day: a dread of the approach of evening and of the awful possibility that they themselves or perhaps one of their close friends might be seized as a ritual leader. One moran whose ancestry made him ineligible expressed his own vicarious fears. Whoever they were, two of his age mates were to be plucked away, violating the manyata bond of sharing in everything including a common destiny. The ritual leaders were to be condemned to an uncertain future, even an early death, and he felt as though a part of his own self was condemned. Eventually all was packed for the migration. The procession was led by a few firestick patrons who knew the secret location, a spot about four miles further south. Then came the manyata-mothers with their laden donkeys, some straggled from time to time, and others stopped to readjust their loads, halting the procession that followed. Then came the remaining patrons, and at their rear a few with whips to control the pace of the moran, so that they did not overtake the straggling women. Then came the moran in four files, two for Maparasha and one each for Meto and Silale, wearing such lionskin trophies and ostrich feather headdresses as they had. They carried their shields, held high their manyata flags, and raised their spears to the rhythm of their lion dance. Each time the procession was halted by the patrons, the dancing would intensify and minor epidemics of shaking broke out: a yelp, some shaking, and then more yelps and more shaking. Possibly thirty of the moran shook, while many more were shivering. Finally at the tailend of the procession, came a file of about thirty girls, escorted by four moran. By the time that the body of the procession arrived at the eunoto site, the women had already been directed by the leading firestick patrons to build their huts in a large circle. This was the point, incidentally at which the violent eunoto affray had erupted in Purko in 1945 when rival manyat competed for the prime position in the village. In Matapato, there was no prime position to be fought over; and here in any event, manyata rivalries appeared to have dissipated before the migration. When the moran arrived, they were directed to fetch logs for the fire and to cut thorn branches for the village fence. In a matter of hours an unremarkable stretch of open bushland overshadowed by the mountain was transformed into a joint manyata village. Meanwhile, the patrons blessed the forty-nine young cattle in the centre of the village; and then holding down the young black bull, they kindled the manyata fire on his back. The manner of lighting this fire is popularly related to the misfortune that dogs the ritual leader. According to one version, it is the unpropitiousness of lighting it on a living bull that has the effect of a firestick patrons' curse. According to another it is ‘medicine’ provided by the Prophet which they put in the flames that has the effect of sorcery. 3 The fracas concerned respectively the Ngorisho R among the Loodokilani, the Meruturud L and the Nyankusi R among the Purko. The Annual Report for 1945 (AR/Kaj-Nar/1945:3) presumably refers obliquely to this last incident. Various moran looked on, aware that their patrons were performing an essential preliminary to installing the two incumbents in a matter of hours. As the shadows lengthened and the new moon was just visible, all the huts had been erected and the moran were called to the village. Most of them were quickly rounded up, but some were found lurking in the bush nearby, apparently hoping that their absence would not be noticed. There were rumours that several had already run away. Once assembled, the moran were mustered round the patrons' fire, singing emosiroi and facing inwards in a double circle, about thirty yards in diameter with a pathway between the outer and inner rings. Then further delays prolonged the suspense when it was discovered that some of the manyata-mothers had not yet taken a flame from the patrons' fire to kindle their own hearths. This prompted a routine check on all huts. Eventually the patrons were satisfied that the procedure for seizing the two ritual leaders could continue. A posse wearing capes and consisting of the three moran spokesmen and four strong aides ambled round the pathway between the two rings. They glanced over the moran as they passed, and were poised at any moment to seize the ritual leader. In the gathering twilight, they continued to circumambulate for perhaps twenty minutes while the other moran continued the slow measured tones of emosiroi with tense shivery expressions. One or two yelped and started to shake from time to time. As darkness closed in, it only became clear that the posse had seized the ritual leader when there was a cry and a scuffle. Other moran near the spot joined in to hold him, while a woman's apron was forced over his shoulders. Shivering, screaming, and throwing his limbs violently in all directions, he was half dragged and half carried to his mother's hut and forced to sit beside her fire opposite three firestick patrons. For a time he continued to scream and seemed almost delirious, while his mother and his young brother, who was a manyata herdboy, were also overcome with grief. About fifteen of his closer moran friends gathered, singing to comfort him, and a cow with male calf was tethered in front of the hut as a gift from his age-group. The commotion eventually subsided and the moran were again assembled into their rings to sing emosiroi ; and the same procedure was followed to seize and instal the deputy ritual leader. Once this too had been completed, the circle was finally broken. With a sense of general relief there was dancing and high spirits in various parts of the village, by groups of moran with their girls, and also by manyata-mothers in their own groups. For the first time that day, the festive atmosphere returned and continued into the night. The Pleiades star cluster was by now barely visible in the evening sky, and the eunoto sacrifice, which formed the next climax, could not be performed until the cluster had reappeared in the early morning in two months time. The sheer size of the gathering in these hard times could not be sustained for more than a day. Next morning, there was a general exodus by both elders and moran, seeking food elsewhere. Some moran made their way back to their forest camps. The parting gift for elders was one mug of tea to be shared among every four men, and it was accepted that there was no point in remonstrating for more. There was no more. Those that remained in the vicinity were primarily the manyata moran and their mothers.\",\n",

       "  \"Not only does aguardiente in some contexts serve as medium by means of which witchcraft can be communicated, but also it has a certain disease producing potential of its own when it is taken in certain amounts within a certain time period. (The ceremonial drinking plus one or more adjacent informal drinking units.) We will now review a few of the disease processes which are interpreted as beginning immediately adjacent to drinking performances. The most common illness that results from drinking is a state that may be glossed as a “hangover” /GOMA, XCAMEL YUUN TRAWO/. This is a minor illness which involves the symptoms of “headache, loss of appetite, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, trembling,” the response to which is selected from the following alternative set. The condition of GOMA is nearly exclusive with the ability to engage in routine agricultural performances. This means that the day after a ceremonial drinking plus informal drinking segment, a man does not work. He has the choice, then, of staying around the house or leaving the house to perform some minor tasks such as gathering poles to support chayote vines, looking at his cattle, or any other task that takes him out of the household setting. This is an important distinction since if a man stays around the house he increases the probability that he will continue drinking by some considerable degree. The confusion of setting with cure for GOMA is further reduced if we consider the specific remedies which are employed. Aguardiente is a “hot” substance. This “heat” causes the illness, and the illness can be reduced by drinking remedies which are “cool” or “cold.” Coca cola is such a remedy. A man may stay around the house and drink coca cola by way of reducing the GOMA. A second remedy for reducing a hangover is to drink as much as onehalf a pint of aguardiente. This is the Tzeltal equivalent to the “hair of the dog” response. Drinking a small amount of aguardiente and staying around the house are the two conditions which make it most likely that the man will continue drinking that day. Drinking coca cola and staying around the house make it slightly less likely that a man will drink on that day. Finally, drinking either aguardiente or coca cola and leaving the house to perform some minor task makes it less and less probable that a man will go on drinking that day. These observations are relevant to an interpretation of the cure for a hangover since they clearly include alternative plans for furth action which either produce further hangovers or do not. In other words, if one wishes to cure a hangover and go on drinkin he drinks aguardiente and stays in his house where his previous day's drinking companions will be sure to find him. If, on the other hand, one wishes to stop drinking, he will drink coca cola and leave the house.\",\n",

With him is the Fakih Adan, a savan of ignoble origin. * The system of caste, which prevails in El Yemen, though not in the northern parts of Arabia, is general throughout the Somali country. The principal families of outcasts are the following. The Yebir correspond with the Dushan of Southern Arabia: the males are usually jesters to the chiefs, and both sexes take certain parts at festivals, marriages, and circumcisions. The number is said to be small, amounting to about 100 families in the northern Somali country. The Tomal or Handad, the blacksmiths, originally of Aydur race, have become vile by intermarriage with serviles. They must now wed maidens of their own class, and live apart from the community: their magical practices are feared by the people, —the connection of wits and witchcraft is obvious,—and all private quarrels are traced to them. It has been observed that the blacksmith has ever been looked upon with awe by barbarians on the same principle that made Vulcan a deity. In Abyssinia all artisans are Budah, sorcerers, especially the blacksmith, and he is a social outcast as among the Somal; even in El Hejaz, a land, unlike Yemen, opposed to distinctions amongst Moslems, the Khalawiyah, who work in metal, are considered vile. Throughout the rest of El Islam the blacksmith is respected as treading in the path of David, the father of the craft. The word “Tomal,” opposed to Somal, is indigenous. “Handad” is palpably a corruption of the Arabic “Haddad,” iron-worker. . The Midgan, “one-hand,” corresponds with the Khadim of Yemen: he is called Rami or “archer” by the Arabs. There are three distinct tribes of this people, who are numerous in the Somali country: the best genealogists cannot trace their origin, though some are silly enough to derive them, like the Akhdam, from Shimr. All, however, agree in expelling the Midgan from the gentle blood of Somali land, and his position has been compared to that of Freedman amongst the Romans. These people take service under the different chiefs, who sometimes entertain great numbers to aid in forays and frays; they do not, however, confine themselves to one craft. Many Midgans employ themselves in hunting and agriculture. Instead of spear and shield, they carry bows and a quiver full of diminutive arrows, barbed and poisoned with the Waba,—a weapon used from Faizoghli to the Cape of Good Hope. Like the Veddah of Ceylon, the Midgan is a poor shot, and scarcely strong enough to draw his stiff bow. He is accused of maliciousness; and the twanging of his string will put to flight a whole village. The poison is greatly feared: it causes, say the people, the hair and nails to drop off, and kills a man in half an hour. The only treatment known is instant excision of the part; and this is done the more frequently, because here, as in other parts of Africa, such stigmates are deemed ornamental. In appearance the Midgan is dark and somewhat stunted; he is known to the people by peculiarities of countenance and accent. When they appear the conversation becomes intensely intellectual: sometimes we dispute religion, sometimes politics, at others history and other humanities. Yet it is not easy to talk history with a people who con-',\n",

       "  'When a number of persons give three different reasons for one and the same action, and are equally sincere throughout, it is to be presumed that the three different statements are so many different ways of saying one and the same thing. We may therefore conclude that the Andaman Islanders believe that there is a peculiar power in foods (or in some foods) which makes it dangerous to eat them. This danger may be expressed by saying that the person who has eaten food will, unless he takes certain precautions, be liable to be ill. Now sickness is believed to be caused by the spirits of the jungle and the sea, and therefore an alternative or equivalent statement of the same belief is that after a person has eaten food he is in danger from the spirits. We may therefore conclude that the word ot-kimil , when it is used to describe the condition of a person who has eaten food, denotes simply this condition of danger, and nothing more. For this we shall find ample confirmation later on. Subject to such later confirmation I will here state what has been maintained, which is (1) that the era-puli patterns are to be explained as being protective, (2) that the eating of food is regarded as dangerous, and (3) that this danger is associated in the minds of the natives with sickness and with the spirits. It will be convenient to leave the first of these three propositions for later discussion and take up the second, seeking to find the meaning of this belief in the dangerous properties of food.',\n",

On the other hand, women suffer more than men from ringworm, mainly in the umbilical region. Nothing is done to rid them of it because the discomfort is slight. I suggested an Indian cure made with the leaves of the neem tree, or Melia azedarach, very common in Southern Asia where it is considered sacred. I imported the plant to Little Andaman, but the Onge displayed no interest in it. I found a single instance of leucoderma, in a woman with whitish spots on her hands and lips. I could get no reliable information about the incidence of cancer, but it appears to be rare on the island. No baldness is to be seen in Little Andaman, and I found few traces of greying hair, as the Onge die young.

The bungai may be represented by a young plant which is placed in a jar on the longhouse gallery for the enactment of a protective rite and is disposed of subsequently.

       "  'The personal name of this man-god was Saku, or as some said, Sako; according to Pa Fenuatara, his descendant, he was known on earth as Pu Siku. He was the son of the Kafika chief Asoaso (see Chap. 4). He was a “sacred child” (nephew) to the people of Nga Faea, since his mother came from that group, and tradition links his name with that of one section of the modern representatives of Nga Faea, the lineage of Siku. 24 Those who look for similarities may note that according to Codrington (1891, 94-9) a chief of Florida named Siko, who afterwards became a ghost, instituted the seasonal Matambala rites. One member of this group, son of Pa Fangatoto, bore in 1929 the personal name Sako. Ordinarily however, the personal name of the mangod was never uttered by Tikopia. He was known instead as Te Atua i Kafika, “the Deity of Kafika”, or more familiarly by the people of the clan merely as “Te Atua”, “The Deity”, no further specification being needed. This is in itself an indication of his supremacy. He bore also several ritual names which were invoked on appropriate occasions by the different clan chiefs. His personal name among the gods, which was consequently that most properly to be invoked in the kava , was Mapusia. By the Ariki Kafika, however, he was called upon often under the honorific title of “Toku Ariki Tapu”, “My Sacred Chief”. The personal name Mapusia was rarely used in the kava on account of its sacredness--“it is not called upon, called upon constantly” said the Ariki in justification of his euphemistic mode of address. Another of these titles was “Te Ariki Fakamataku”, “The Fear-Causing Chief”. He was regarded as principally responsible for storms and thunder, which was caused by the trailing of his staff as he walked through the heavens clattering it from side to side and making the welkin resound. His anger was believed to be terrible. He could overwhelm an offender by striking him or his family with sickness and death. He could blast the whole island with drought, a hurricane or pestilence. Although he was the principal deity of the Kafika clan alone, he was feared by all the people of the island. Pa Vainunu said, “Look at the chiefly houses--they are respected, it is true--but the whole of the land obeys the one Chief, the chief of the Kafika. In this land which stands here the one god is above all others, the Deity of Kafika. No god can come and supplant him; he is high because he is strong.” This was a partisan statement, from a man of Kafika, but it did express the situation as it actually appeared.',\n",
       "  'Under the unhygienic and unhealthy conditions, the Onges keep on struggling with life. They apply their indigenous methods of curing diseases. The most common method of treatment, prevalent among Onges, is to use clay. It is specially done in times of fever. Cipriani has also made a mention of such local practice while stating that, ‘for any kind of fever the Onges turn immediately to their stock remedy, smearing the entire body with the usual mixture of ochre, turtle fat and honey. The legs, arms, chest and abdomen are then tightly bound with strips of Ficus bark, which are removed and renewed from time to time. Whether the patient has pain in the abdomen or in the chest, appropriate part is given a form of vigorous massage by the feet of one of the bystanders. For fever, the red clay is believed to be having more medical value; white clay is meant to save the skin from insect-bite. According to the Onges, the clay, ochre, honey and turtle fat have medicinal value and are used for cure as well as prevention. The clay as such or mixed with other medical substance, is used in case of the bite by some snake or scorpion, constipation and breast infection. It is further believed that honey, too, has some medical value and helps in quick healing of wounds. In addition to the medicinal substances, another method of curing a patient of wounds and pains is to expose him to hot smoke. The other method is through the “holy man” who, with his powers, helps cure some disease. It is also regarded as a chief method of prevention. ‘Kuvera’ is their traditional medicineman and helps cure the patients suffering from the influence of evil spirits. So far, no agency of health or any other department concerned with providing medical facilities to the Onges exists in any of the camps of the Onges. Even in the two major settlements at Dugong-Creek and South-West Bay, not even a compounder is posted. Some medical facilities exist at Hut Bay, which is a far off place from Onge hutments. Because of their traditional beliefs and the distance the Onges are reluctant to go to the dispensary at Hut Bay. In fact the Onges could be better motivated for modern drugs and medicines provided some agencies in this regard could work right in their major settlement areas. Looking to the problem of biological extinction among the Onges, there is an urgent need to establish better medical facilities at least in the two bigger settlements. The health educator has to convince the Onges about the superiority of the modern methods of treatment. Apart from curing diseases, a thorough medical check-up, at regular intervals of time, of the Onges is desirable. In the context of the declining number of the Onges the health programme should be under-taken on priority basis and in right earnest.',\n",
       "  '‘Young women’ is followed by an enumeration of objects used by women, such as the yamstick and various kinds of pitchi . They ‘sing’ these, including their own arm, to fill them with arunkulta and kill the man. The second part deals with various kinds of bushes and with the magpie, which is ‘sitting down.’ My informants did not tell me what this meant. But it is easy to guess from other texts. The bushes are seen by some mythical beings during their wanderings, and as this is an ilpindja, we may add, during their lovesick wanderings. Usually it is the women who rush to the men in this fashion, but as the women are the charmers in this case, it is probably the young men who put the witchetty bush on their heads ( maliara tantana ) and rush to the women. The magpie is either one of the things seen on the way, or perhaps indicates the totemic cycle to which the ilpindja belongs. With the line lunpurgnula manyinila we have a different set of ideas. They are ‘singing’ the bones deposited beside the fire. They are lirinchiri flowing with the life blood extracted from the victim. The word lurpmanjurmankur, translated here as arunkulta , really means the marks of decoration on the bone. When the bone enters the flesh of the victim, these engraved marks stick in his flesh like the barbs of a spear or harpoon, making it difficult for the sorcerer to extract the bone.',\n",

But the butcher made a drink using the red patch of paper from the knife that had been used to kill the pig, and as soon as the man had drunk it, he recovered.” Other measures are taken to protect against danger at this time: wine is poured over rice, and this rice is given to the pig just before the slaughter (an exorcising technique in other contexts); the rope used to tie the pig's legs, the slaughtering knife, and the butcher's apron are all marked with patches of red (often used as a prophylactic); and the pig is offered ritual money.

They even make themselves responsible, relative to the intensity of the sexual intercourse, for the slow dying of the animal struck by the poisoned arrow. The poison is smeared on the arrow point with a wooden spatula, and, in order to protect the dried substance from crumbling or from dissolving in damp weather (since it is very hygroscopic), it is wrapped with a strip of thin antelope skin that is dehaired and made soft by being rubbed with fat. The poison acts very quickly, and, to be sure, by suddenly stopping the heart activity. In the case of a genet shot in the abdomen, breathing difficulty set in after five minutes, along with rapid movements of the nostrils and violent, cramplike muscle twitchings of the body and limbs. With brief interruptions of a quarter to a third of a minute the symptoms were repeated and increased in intensity. The pupils dilated to a circle. Nine minutes and 18 seconds after the shot the pupils, up to then blue-black, suddenly became sea-green, and, with violent twitching, death came. With quite fresh poison death is supposed to come in even a shorter time. In the steppe the poison is tested by shooting an antelope with an arrow newly poisoned. If on the trail of the fleeing animal one finds fresh urine and excrement, teh poison is regarded as acting too weakly. Good poison put in the foot of a live turtle must lead to its death before it has crawled five or six steps away. Neither the Asa nor the Wandorobo are acquainted with a physiological anecdote. For smaller, simple, and penetrating flesh wounds immediate washing with fresh urine is supposed to help. Aged Wandorobo often showed me scars on their own bodies, especially on arms and legs, which are supposed to have been caused by shots with poisoned arrows two to four centimeters deep.

       "  \"Now, to make this Drum useful, there are two Things required; an Index and a Hammer. The First shews the Thing desired by pointing at some certain Figure on the Drum, with the other they beat the Drum. I call that an Index , what Samuel Rheen calls a Bunch of Rings made of Metal . For when they make use of the Drum, they take a pretty large Ring, on which they hang several small ones, all which make up a Bunch. Tho' they also sometimes vary in this Point. One of those I have by me, is made of a thick Piece of Copper, about the bigness of a Crown Piece, with a square Hole in the middle; and instead of the small Rings, it is hung round about with little Copper Chains. The other is made of Brass, on which hangs a round Copper Plate, fastned to little Chains. I have also seen some made of Bones, resembling in shape the Greek Letter , with Rings hanging about them; and of other different Shapes. Mine. I have given you a Draught of, with the two Drums A. B. mark'd with G . However since they most commonly make use of a Ring (those Drums sent me by my Lord Chancellor, having no others than such) this is the reason, why the so often-mentioned anonymous M. S. has call'd them barely Rings. The Ring , says he, laid upon the Drum, did not stand still in any certain Place. Olaus Magnus calls them Brazen Serpents or Toads : For so they call those Rings, not that they are really such, or have any resemblance to Serpents or Toads, but because by those Rings they represent those Creatures, which they look upon to be very acceptable to the Devil, and whose Pictures they frequently make use of in their Magick. Peucerus calls them Frogs, They have likewise , says he, a brazen Frog, fastned to an Iron Bar : Perhaps because there is no great difference betwixt a Toad and a Frog. Which makes Olaus Petri say: In the Center they draw the Picture of their God, upon which they lay a Frog or some other Piece made of Brass. Torn us tells us that the Laplanders call it Arpa. The Index , says he, which they cali Arpa, is composed out of several Chain Rings, made of Copper, Iron, Brass or Silver : Which shews us, that they are not only made of Brass, but also of several other Metals. The Hammer they call that same Instrument, wherewith they beat the Drum, as we may see from what has been alledged out of Olqus Magnus and Johannes Torn us ; the Last of which says; They raise their Familiar Spirits by beating the Skin with a Hammer . But this Hammer must be imagined to have the least resemblance to a Smith's Hammer, as the Engraver of Olaus Magnus's had failly persuaded himself, but it is a certain Instrument so call'd by the Laplanders , and dedicated to this peculiar use, made of a Raindeer's Horn, branching out like a Fork; this being the Head of the Hammer, the rest the Handle. The true Shape of it I have given you in the same Cut, which contains the two Drums under A . and B . the Hammer being mark'd with H. With this Hammer they beat the Drum, not so much to make a Noise, but thereby to put the Ring, laid upon the Skin, into motion, so as to pass over the Pictures, till they are satisfied in what they look for. And thus I have given you a description of the Lapland Drum , with all its Appertinencies, viz . the Ring and the Hammer, such as they use among the Laplanders , subject to the Crown of Sweden . The Finlanders , bordering upon Norway , and subject to Denmark , do likewife use those Drums, but something different of those I have described to you just now; as is manifest from the Description given of them by the learned Olaus Wormius . It is however my Opinion, That the difference betwixt theirs and ours is not real, but rather accidental; arising from thence, that the Drum described by Wormius , was perhaps intended for some particular use. But let us see, for Wormius describes the Drum he makes mention of in the Description of his Study; The Lapland Drum , says he, which they use in their Magick, and by beating which, to a certain Tune, they pretend to discover many Things, is made of an oval Piece of Wood bollowed; its Length is about a Foot, its Bredth ten Inches, having six Ho'es cut in it with a Handle in the middle; whereby they hold it with the left Hand, whilst they beat with the Right. Over this they stretch a Skin. fasined to it with Nerves, painted with divers rude Shap'd Figures, drawn with Blood or some other Red Colour. Upon this lies a Piece of Brass in the Shape of a Rhomboides, somewhat convex, its Diameter being of two Inches, in the Middle of which, and on each Corner, bangs a small Brass Chain. The Instrument made of Bone, wherewith they beat the Drum, is about six Inches long. of the thickness of a little Finger, resembling the Latin T. The Laplanders use this Drum upon divers Occasions. and pretend to do great Matters by the help of it; which makes them have it in great Esteem, and keep it with much Reverence; they secure and wrap it up together with the Index and Hammer in a Lambskin. The Laplanders, says Samuel Rheen, set a great value upon their Drum, for they always keep it wrap'd up, together with the Rings and Hammer, in a Lamb-Skin . Thus it is in my Edition, tho' I have found it in another written Loomskin , which does not signifie a Lamb-Skin, but the Skin of a certain Bird, of the Water Fowl kind, and is in this Country called Loom. Wormius has given us a Description of it in his Study, and I shall perhaps have an Opportunity of describing it more at large, when I shall publish a Catalogue of the Rarities I preserve in my Study. Nay, they look upon this Drum as a Sacred Thing, which for this Reason, must not be touch'd by marriagable Women. No Woman , says the same author, that is come to Age of Maturity, is permitted to touch the Drum . If the Drum is to be removed from one Place to another, it is either carried last of all, and by the Hands of a Man, or else must be brought by a quite different Road, or some untrod Way. The Drum , says the same Author, never goes First, but Last of all, being carried by a Man, and not a Woman; somesimes thro' such Roads as were never made use of before . He gives us likewise the Reason of it, viz . Because they are afraid, that if any Body, but especially a Woman should pass the same way after it, would be in great danger of losing either her Health, or perhaps her Life; and this Hazard they run for the first three Days after; of which they do give you several Instances. They will tell you, says he, that if any Woman Kind, that is come to Age of Maturity, should travel the same Road, thro' which the Drum has been carried, within three Days before, the same would either dye immediately, or at least fall into some great Misfortune, and this they prove by many Instances . It seems as if the Devil would not have his Worship despised, but keeps a strict Hand over those who neglect his Rites, by punishing them severely, as far as God is pleased to permit; so that there is no great reason to doubt of the Truth of those Examples. Now, because it happens sometimes, Women must of necessity travel the same way, the Devil is somewhat more favourable to them, provided they pay him, as an Acknowledgment, a Ring of Brass, to the same Drum, that was carried that way before them. If it so happen , says the before-mentioned Author, that a Woman is forced to travel the same way, thro' which the Drum has been carried before, she is abliged to present a Brass Ring for the use of the said Drum . But since we have told you before, that according to their Opinion, they can effect strange Things, by the help of this Drum, we must take a view, what these Things are, and how they are performed. Olaus Petri mentions Three; relating either to their Hunting, to their Sacrifices, and the enquiring into far distant Matters. They have , says he, a threefold use for this Drum, in relation to their Hunting, Sacrifices, and the knowledge of Things at a distance. Samuel Rheen mentions Four. The First , To enquire what passes in other Places, tho' never so remote. The Second , To know the good and bad Success of any Undertaking, and what issue any Distemper is like to have. The Third , To Cure Diseases. The Fourth , To know what sort of Sacrifice their Gods are pleased with, and what kind of Beasts each God desires for his Sacrifice. They don't all use the same way or Ceremonies, in making their Enquiries. There are however several Circumstances which are to be observed by all. The First is, That they take care to stretch the Skin very stiff, by holding it near the Fire. They hold , says Olaus Petri, the Skin to the Fire, to make it Stiff . Secondly, That they don't always beat in one Place, but round about the Index or Ring. Thirdly, That they first begin to beat softly, and so continue stronger and stronger, till they have done their Business. Torn us says to this effect: He lifts up the Drum a little, and then beats round about the Index, first softly till the Index begin to stir and to move about, and when he finds it removed from the Place where it first laid, to one or the other side of the Drum, the Drummer beats harder and harder, till the Index Points at a certain Sign, from whence they may draw a Conjecture as to the Point they sought for . Another Ceremony they constantly observe, is, That he who beats the Drum, does it upon his Knees, not standing, and so do all the rest that are present. He that is skilful in this Art , says the same Author, falls down upon his Knees, as well as all the rest, and so he takes the Drum . As to the Occasions, of their beating the Drum, we having given you the last of them already; we must now proceed to the rest, the first of which is, to know, what is transacted in far distant Places; concerning which Olaus Magnus speaks to this effect; If they are solicitous to know in what Condition their Friends or Foes are, tho' at 500 or 1000 Leagues distance, they go to a Lap or Einlander, whom they know well skill'd in this Art, and by the means of a Present of a Linnen Sute of Cloths, or some Mony, they oblige him to try his Skill, to know what their Friends or Foes are doing at that time, and where they are . And so he proceeds to give an Account of the whole manner of doing it, of which we shall say A In Deser. Norway. more anon. Peter Clandi , speaking of the Finlanders under the Jurifdiction of Norway , says: They are so Skilful in this Art, that they can satisfie any Body, that wants to know, what other People are doing, at a great distance . He likewise relates the manner of performing it, and gives us an Instance, which happened at Bergen , the chief Trading City of Norway , which is to be seen upon record there, viz . in the publick Register of the German Factory: There was one John Delling , living in that City, in the Quality of a Factor, of a certain German Merchant, who meeting one time with a Friend of his called James Smausuend , who had a certain Norwegian Finlaplander in his Company, he ask'd him, whether he could tell him, what his Master was then doing in Germany? The Finlaplander having answered him he could, began immediately to make a great Noise, as if he were Drunk, then leaping and turning himself several times round in a Circle, he fell upon the Ground without any Sense or Motion; after he had continued thus for some time, he recovered out of his Trance, started up, and told him, what his Master was transacting in Germany ; which being immediately entred into the Register of the German Merchants, was found, upon enquity made afterwards, to agree with what the Finlaplander had told him. A memorable Instance, which deserves the more Credit, as being confirmed by publick Authority. There are besides this many more Inslances of this kind, related upon the Credit and Experience of those now living, among which, that which happned to Johannes Torn us deserves to be taken particular Notice of; a certain Laplander , who is still living, having told him all what happned to him in his first Journey into Lapland ; he never having seen him before, These are his Words; He told me truly and exactly every thing that bad happned to me in my Journey into Eapland: And, notwithstanding I was sensible of the Truth of what the Laplander had told me, concerning this journey, I told him, that what he had said was altogether false; for fear he sbould glory in his Diabolical Art, or rely upon it, as a means to investigate Truth . There is not the least shew of Reason, to Question the Truth of this Relation, being founded upon the Authority' of a Person not in the least addicted to Superstition, who speaks by his own Experience. The Authors however differ in the Method, used in making those Discoveries. Olaus Magnus describes it thus: The Drummer goes into some private Room, accompanied only by one Person, besides his own Wife. Then by beating upon the Anvil with his Hammer be moves the Brazen Frog or Serpent about the Figures, muttering at the same time certain Words; till he falls into a Trance, lying extended on the Ground, as if Dead: His Companion in the mean while taking great Care, that no Gnat, Flie or any other living Creature touch him. By the force of his Charms, his Soul is by some evil D mon or other carryed into some distant Place, from whence he brings back (as a Token that be has executed his Commission) a Ring, Knife, or some such Thing; which, so soon as he rises from the Ground, he shews, and declares to his Companion. Peter Claudi gives us the following Account of it: He falls upon the Ground without any Life or Motion, turning quite yellow or Black in the Face. Thus he continues for One or more Hours, according to the distance of the Place, of which enquiry is to he made. When he recovers from this Trance, he is able to tell what passes in that Place, and what those People transact there, of which Enquiry was made . Here no mention is made either of a Drum, Song, his Companions, or any Tokens of the Performance of the Business; which difference must be attributed to this, that each Author gives an Account of what seem'd most worth taking notice of to him, without excluding the rest, mentioned by others; so that from what has been said already, the use of the Drum can scarce be call'd in question; but what Olaus Petri relates of the Drums, made for this particular use, viz . That they have a Handle shaped like a Cross, deserves our special Observation. The Drum they make use of, says he, is the same as I deseribed to you before, with this difference only, that the lower part of it is divided into four Parts, by a Cross, by which the Sorcerer bolds it with one Hand . Here you find a Handle made in the shape of a Cross, of which make is the Drum, which I told you was prefented to me by my Lord Henry Flemming , Colonel of a Finland Regiment of Foot, the Draught of the lower Side of which you see in the next following Figure.\",\n",

       "  \"“According to Iban belief, every person has a semengat , or separable soul. This semengat , during life, inhabits the body, though it does have the power of wandering abroad; and dream experiences, say the Iban, are evidence of this But in addition to the semengat , there is another entity called the ayu, which is a kind of secondary soul or soul-substitute. Everyone has both a semengat and an ayu as an old manang , or shaman, put it: ‘Our semengat and ayu share the same breath’ (‘Semengat enggau ayu kitai saum seput’) . But the ayu does not reside in the body. It takes the form of a kind of plant - it is usually likened to the bamboo (buloh) in appearance - and it is believed to grow on a far off mountain. On the slopes of this vast mountain grow the myriad ayu of all the Iban people, and there they are tended by an aged and beneficient supernatural being named Manang Betuah. The ayu of each bilek-family are conceived as of growing in a separate and compact clump, and when a child is born a new shoot appears at the base of the clump, just as it does with the bamboo plant itself. The health of the various members of the family - so it is believed - is controlled in a kind of magical symbiosis by the state of growth of their various ayu . If, for example, the ayu should become overgrown with creepers, the individual whose soul-substitute it is, will become ill; and shamans (manang) are frequently commissioned to visit the ayu of sick persons to free them from encumbrances, and generally to tend them. It is the soul of the shaman that carries out this task, while the shaman himself is in a state of trance. The purpose of the nusop ayu ritual, which often accompanies adoption, is the cutting away of the child's ayu from the ayu clump of his natal group, and the replanting of it with the ayu clump of his adoptive bilek-family .”\",\n",

       "  'The chief of Nga Ravenga had married a daughter of the Ariki Kafika (which daughter is not stated), and to her father she fled when her husband was killed. According to one account she carried with her an infant son; according to another the child was born after she had reached Kafika. The child was protected by his grandfather who named him “Fakaarofatia”, “Orphaned”. Soon after his arrival the portion of flesh was still hanging up outside the house, and from it the fat dripped, making a little pool on the ground. The infant, crawling about, strayed that way. It dabbled its fingers in the liquid, then sucked them. Hence, it is said arose the morbid disease which afflicts the chiefs of Fangarere, owing to the fact that they touched and actually absorbed some of the liquids from their dead father. This is the disease termed te mataora , an ulceration akin to yaws. (In 1929, the Ariki Fangarere was a sufferer from it, his foot being so ulcerated that he tended to travel as much as possible by canoe.)',\n",

One was that of a little girl who was afflicted with a bad headache by the spirit of her grandmother. She recovered very quickly, and I heard no details. Another was the case mentioned in an earlier chapter of a young woman who nearly had a miscarriage through the use of native medicines. In her case, there was not at first any general agreement as to the cause of her illness, and she was taken to the local maternity centre by her father and her mother’s brother. Here she was examined by the visiting European supervisor, who wanted her moved to a hospital where she could have European attention. This necessitated consulting her husband, who would have had to pay for the treatment, and he flatly refused to allow it, holding that the disease was supernaturally caused. Shortly afterwards, she recovered sufficiently to walk home.',\n",
       "  'The means of achieving ritual purity and strength include, besides the rules for sexual activity, certain food prohibitions, and withdrawal into the temple, confession, which consists of an acknowledgment of sins. It takes place only when one is sick or otherwise has misfortune. It is not because sin in itself oppresses the Kágaba and he wishes to be freed from it that he confesses, in order to be able to live as a pure man, but because otherwise it would go ill with him. The most important sins known to him are forbidden cohabitation, especially unnatural sexual satisfaction with close relatives or with animals ( sagá sagá ), as is given as the cause of the great flood, and adultery. Another expression for “to sin” is zinkuali . The fact that precisely sexual excesses are regarded as sins and the cause of sickness and evil undoubtedly lies in a basic view of the Kágaba which is also to be found among other tribes, namely, that cohabitation and intercourse with a woman weaken the strength of a man and endanger the success of every undertaking. This accounts for the magical strength of the novices, as long as they have not yet had intercourse with a woman.',\n",

       "  'The method of treatment for both mayembe and mizimu is to induce the spirit to speak through the victim and identify itself so that a medicine may be prepared or the person who sent it may be induced to remove it. I was called to see an elderly woman who had had severe stomach ache. She was surrounded by women neighbours who had covered her head with a cloth and were giving her inhalations of burning peppers in order to make things so unpleasant for the spirit that it would reveal itself. At the time of my arrival she was extremely agitated and was making a series of incoherent barking noises and did indeed seem possessed in some way. From lack of time and out of consideration for her son who had taken me there I was obliged to interrupt the proceedings. Palpation of her stomach revealed that there was no gross illness. I therefore reassured her and those around that she was recovering and gave her the only medicine I had with me at the time, a tranquillizer tablet (chlorpromazine 100 mgm). She apparently made a quick and uneventful recovery with no recurrence. The interruption, however, had made some of the women neighbours angry because it had prevented the act being played out to the full. The true diagnosis therefore could not be made, since it was assumed that the spirit had been about to reveal itself. It is quite likely that her barking would have become coherent enough for some, possibly cryptic, information to have been gathered from it. This kind of an attack by a muzimu is known as kigalanga . Mair (Note 27 Note — Mair (1934, p. 226). An account of the capturing of mizimu by causing the patient to vomit them into a gourd is given by Kagwa (1934, p. 126). Ssekamwa (1967, p. 37) also describes a case of the capture of mayembe . The involuntary shivering which comes with fever may be interpreted as empewo which means a cold wind and so by extension a ghost. Dr. J. Bennett tells me that the word is also used occasionally for cases of kwashiorkor in infants. The Baganda recognise that this comes following the weaning of the child. The body swells and because of this the skin feels cold so that it is thought that the illness is due to the child getting cold at night now that it is separated from the mother. The word empewo in this context merely means that the child gets cold and does not refer to the extended meaning of a ghost. The illness is properly known as obwosi and also as omusana, the sun, because the stretched pale skin shines like the sun. ) says that “the spirit is supposed to enter the stomach by the mouth and cause a kind of indigestion known as kigalanga, whose first symptom is said to be a very cold feeling. This is regarded as the manifestation par excellence of spirit possession . . .” Indeed the word empewo is used for both a spirit and a cold wind. A muzimu can attack people of either sex seizing them by the throat and killing them instantly. In the case of kigalanga however time is available to treat the condition, and “the first thing to do on such an occasion is to ‘make the spirit speak’.” (Mair, ibid).',\n",

       "  'Weaning is done when the baby is about one year old or somewhat less, but long before this he is beginning to get solid food occasionally. Alternating at first between the breast and small quantities of masticated food, the former is withdrawn more and more. But as a general rule the process is not so easy and is almost never managed without a violent protest from the babies, who cry, shriek, and kick in order to gain access to the breast. The mothers then frequently try to explain to the baby, by estures and words, that they ought not to nurse in the presence of other people “because the breast is very obscene.” By taking the breast abruptly away from him when another person enters, and making appropriate gestures and indications of embarrassment, disgust, and displeasure, the mother thus shows the baby that this is now a matter of a prohibited and secret act of which society does not approve. Thus a baby finally is allowed to nurse only on the very rare occasions when the mother is alone with him. If the baby nevertheless insists and rejects larger quantities of solid food, the father, the mother, or any other adult present tries to frighten him with threats: “If you continue nursing, the snakes will come. If you go on nursing, the toad will eat you.” The next step is the most effective one: the mother rubs her nipples with pepper ( 8 . Capsicum . ), lemon, or any other substance which has a bitter taste. With this, nursing ends completely. The babies react with fits of anger, and many times with violent vomiting, which, as we shall see below, is repeated still later as a sign of protest. If the mother should become pregnant while she is nursing a baby, the latter is always weaned one or two months before the birth, since it is said that otherwise the baby would get sick, and in these cases the pepper or lemon method is always used. Nonetheless, it does occur that after this period and after the delivery, both the first baby and the newborn child nurse simultaneously, although the first one 191 might have been weaned already and fed only solid food. If the mother of a baby should become sick during the period of nursing, the child is immediately weaned, since it is said that the baby can catch the sickness from his mother’s milk. If the baby becomes sick, he is likewise immediately weaned, generally causing his death. The first food given to a baby during the process of weaning and following this is panela water or malanga soup, a broth of ripe platano or of uncooked platano, or pieces of cooked potato. It is always his mother herself who gives him this food, first putting it into the mouth of the baby with her fingers and later using a small spoon made out of a totuma /fruit of the calabash tree/. Older sisters of the baby are never entrusted with this task, and other adult women only very rarely. The food of the baby is cooked separately and not together with that for the family.',\n",

In telling me this he said that the night before he actually saw an atua about five yards away and it fled before him; he accelerated its going by waving his firestick at it. Atua , he said, were frightened of fire and of all pungent scents, too, though they had their own. But in 1952 Pa Fenuatara asked to borrow my electric torch one night, saying he was afraid, of atua .

Standardized personal differences of response to an experience of atua were recognized. I was told how a man going at night sees an atua standing, is frightened, retreats and yells. But another man sees the atua and calls out to it ‘Wait for me, friend’ or questions it; the atua , seeing this stoutheartedness, disappears. Still another man may see the atua and faint, falling over. Folk come up and grasp him, bear him away and press his limbs, asking, ‘Lad, lad, what is the matter with you?’ He wakes up, and answers, ‘I was overcome by an atua who appeared; I was standing in the path and he overcame me.’ (The term for fainting is puroua , literally, ‘covered over’.)',\n",

Simply to look at the lists and prescriptions is to gain two impressions. Firstly, they would not have been recoverably in this form if much of it had not worked; secondly, with no notion of dosage, the risk of failure even if the active principle was right was thereby increased. 71 I own this point to Dr A. de Vente. I own this point to Dr A. de Vente. But here, as in those cases for which the prescription was wrong, there was a sequential series of blocks to falsifiability: if the specific treatment failed, this would be a sign that the affliction was not simple and it therefore required specialist treatment. If the healer's specifics failed, this was a sign of evil interference which had to be identified by divination, and in this way a structural block could be invoked, even if the patient died. Thus a difficult case would move along one axis of the table from individual to communal and the other from symptomatic to non-symptomatic treatment, hence diagonally. The line could be extended off the table since for affliction beyond the norm, such as the early 1890s smallpox epidemic, recourse could only be through appeal to the unseen powers and there divinatory practice merged with the other functions of the royal graves.\",\n",
       "  'To begin with, all people must periodically visit a priest for confession—in private or in public—of all their actions and intentions. An important mechanism of control is introduced here by the idea that sickness is, in the last analysis, the consequence of a state of sinfulness incurred by not living according to the “Law of the Mother.” A man will therefore scrutinize his conscience in every detail and will try to be absolutely honest about his actions and intentions, to avoid falling ill or to cure an existing sickness. Confession takes place at night in the ceremonial house, the máma reclining in his hammock while the confessant sits next to him on a low bench. The other men must observe silence or, at least, converse in subdued voices, while between the priest and the confessant unfolds a slow, halting dialogue in which the máma formulates several searching questions about the confessant’s family life, social relations, food intake, ritual obligations, dreams, and many other aspects of his daily life. People are supposed to confess not only the actual fault they have committed, but also their evil intentions, their sexual or aggressive fantasies, anything that might come to their minds under the questioning of the priest. The nagging fear of sickness, the hypochondriacal observation and discussion of the most insignificant symptoms, will make people completely unburden themselves. There can be no doubt that confession is a psychotherapeutic institution of the first order, within the general system of Kogi religion.',\n",

Pteropus, a giant bat very common in the Andamans, said by Radcliffe-Brown (p. 273) to be eaten by the Andaman Islanders as a protection against rheumatism, is never killed. For some superstitious reason the Onge are simply horrified at the thought of touching such an enormous flying bat. Among the fruits, those of a plant whose wood has such a revolting smell that it is known, in English, as “stooltree”, are believed to have exceptional protective properties for the human body. The fruits themselves smell even worse than the wood, but this, to the Onge, makes them appetizing rather than disgusting. Concerning honey, and the many sugary fruits of the jungle that are available all the year round, the Onge luckily ignore the simple method of distilling alcohol. No intoxicating drink reaches Little Andaman from the outer world, whereas in Great Andaman alcohol, together with imported syphilis, was one of the main causes of depopulation. No syphilis appears as yet to have reached Little Andaman. This is also confirmed by the research carried out by Dr. Hermann Lehmann of London's St. Bartholomew's Hospital, during February 1953 in my Onge camp in Labanare (north-east coast of Little Andaman).\",\n",

According to them, there was ‘a circumstantial tradition among the Baganda of a pygmy tribe called the Banakalanga inhabiting the Mabira forest of Kyaggwe’. Thomas and Scott based their conclusions partly on the views of Johnston and Pitman and partly on a traditional legend which they unfortunately misunderstood. The inhabitants of Kyaggwe believe that the dwarfness of the Banakalanga is a disease caused by the Mbwa fly ( Simulium damnosum Theo ) or by the river god, or by a combination of both. The Kiganda legend regarding the Banakalanga is authentic in so far as it suggests pathological causes and implicitly speaks against any ethnological origins for the stunted growth of the Banakalanga. 4 Banakalanga derives from the verb okulanga, to grow thin. The etymology of the word is significant because it stresses thinness rather than shortness.',\n",

Some translate it as ‘a sleeping disease’ and in fact some types of epilepsy (particularly petit mal ) cause the sufferer to have periodic absences which could well be described by this Luganda name. The illness is said to be brought by eating the bird, it having been put in the food by an enemy. Sleeping is said to be a function of the heart, not the head, which continues the work of dreaming during sleep. This illness is said therefore to affect the heart. It is of interest to note that amongst the Baganda closing the eyes of one’s own volition is not considered necessary before going to sleep; rather the eyes are left open until one goes to sleep and then they close naturally.',\n",

How this has been arrived at can best be understood from the expression hiséi huvá (covering of the dead) for the stone powder wrapped in maize leaves. What comes from the dead protects against death and the dead, just as the demon masks influence the demons. And the stones have many connections to the dead. The ancient forebears were once stone people or changed themselves into stones after death, so the little stones and stone beads used for this mostly come then from the old graves of the coast, from which the Kágaba themselves get them, if they do not perhaps buy them from the Colombians. My whole supply of these magic stones came from the Colombians; the Kágaba, however, had specific names for all of them, and for them themselves their own were not for sale. Finally, the stones were also puma-like creatures and as such brought sicknesses (see pp. 121 ff.). But the little magic stones could do much more than just cure sickness and give protection from it.

       "  \"The Inuit response to these improved medical services has been extremely positive. The nurses report that, at least in Holman, residents are conscientious in attending clinics and responsible in abiding by the nurse's advice when sick. Now that housing conditions have improved and people are spending more of their time in the settlement, most homes are clean and neatly maintained. Consequently, the squalor that was prevalent in the early settlement period has virtually disappeared. There are, however, a number of health problems that remain chronic with the local Inuit population: 1) Ear Disorders--Despite the inroads that have been made in other areas of Inuit health, ear infections, most notably otitis media, have become increasingly common among the younger members of the population. A disproportionate number of children have had serious infections resulting in partial loss of hearing. In the past 10 years, it has been quite common to send children out of the settlement for various kinds of ear surgery, such as tympanoplasties and myringotomies. Many adults have also suffered varying degrees of hearing loss as a result of overexposure to snowmobile engines, outboard motors, and high-powered rifles. 2) Dental Health--Dentists who have worked in the settlement universally comment on the abysmal state of teeth and gums, especially among Inuit children. The incidence of dental caries, abscessed teeth, and peridontal disease is exceptionally high and primarily attributed to poor dental hygiene and the high consumption of sugars in the form of candy and soft drinks. It is not uncommon to find teenagers who have had one or more fully decayed teeth pulled out. Although many adults and children have toothbrushes in their homes, the daily brushing of teeth is a rare occurrence. 3) Attitude towards Infectious Disease--Even though most individuals are aware that many diseases are transmitted from one person to another, practices involving the isolation and containment of sick individuals are seldom followed. Social visitation is rarely curtailed if an individual is indisposed. Children are the most flagrant violators of this simple rule of preventative medicine. Since most parents have little direct control over their children, it is difficult for them to keep children contained in their homes for any length of time. Interestingly enough, one teacher noted that many children intentionally attend school when they are sick in order to get attention from teachers and other children. For these reasons, a contagious disease that enters the settlement will inevitably incapacitate a large number of residents and will even go around several times before disappearing altogether. 4) Alcohol Consumption--Deaths from accidents, injuries, and violence are the leading causes of mortality throughout the N.W.T. An unusually large proportion of these are alcohol related. Although Holman does not yet have the same alcohol-related problems as other, larger settlements, the degree of alcohol consumption is definitely on the upswing. Many local residents, drinkers as well as nondrinkers, frequently comment that much more alcohol is being consumed now than in the recent past. With this increase has come a concomitant rise in alcohol-related accidents and violence. More detail on the nature of alcohol consumption is given in a later chapter. 5) Other Health Problems--Other health problems that are on the increase are such things as obesity, acne, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and myopia. Since most of these are related to changing nutritional patterns, they are discussed in the following section.\",\n",

Skulls have been found with as many as five successful trepanations--which argues for a certain skill in the surgeon, as well as for the vitality of the patient. Krogman 313 Krogman, 1939, p. 12; Ronhaar, 1930, passim . Without having examined the physical evidence which might prove this contention, I believe on other evidence (such as the frequent and severe migraine of the Aymara) that a very plausible case might be made also for the alternative purpose. There is every reason to believe, however, that both motives could have operated. In this connection it is interesting to recall the legend, reported by Vara Cadillo, of the Ichik Ol'qo or child-demon, which inhabits waterfalls and foundtains, growling angrily, and throwing out a rainbow from his navel, by which he exerts an evil influence upon men through the crowns of their heads. Note also the Aymara belief in a vampire-head which sucks blood from the occipital region. considers that the purpose of trephining was to relieve compression fractures of the skull caused by warclubs, but Ronhaar believes that trephining was performed most often for epilepsy or migraine (if the epilepsy were traumatic, it comes to the same thing). Trepanation was done by sawing, cutting, scraping, and drilling with chips of flint, obsidian, quartz, and possibly blades of copper. A gourd, shell, or plaque of silver controlled the herniation of the brain through the operation. Similar is the bleeding performed upon the root of the nose, although this may have been to relieve the swelling in this area caused by a disease called “Gundu.” Another surgical procedure was to tie off multiple lipomata with horse-hairs until they sloughed off.\",\n",

       "  'The cure of a case of spirit possession is accomplished by a method curiously similar to that used in psychoanalysis. The Lauan theory is that the doctor must draw a confession of the name of the spirit from the patient in order to release the spirit from his body. The doctor sees the patient every day, tries to allay his fears, encourages him, talks to him about the spirit, gives him potions of herbs to drink, and rubs his body with medicines. Finally in the course of the treatment, when the doctor touches the part of the body in which the spirit dwells, the patient will cry out. The doctor presses the affected part until it hurts and asks “Who is it?” and in great distress the patient calls the name of the spirit. Immediately the spirit leaves him and he begins to recover.',\n",

It will be recalled that while mahamba are traditionally ailments resulting from possession by ancestral spirits, the modern version are caused by possession by other spirits and may be considered to reflect a tension between the society of the victim and that of the group represented by the spirit. Sufferers from bindele , which is the Luvale word for ‘European’, 1 The Lozi term for both European and bindele is mulua . are believed to be possessed by the spirit of an European.

       "  \"We finally arrived. Before our eyes were a beautiful beach and the majestic river. We lay down, very tired, on that white and soft sand and rested a little ... The sun was about to set ... We needed to think of wood for the night fire ... It was probable that some ounce would want to pay us an unwanted visit: the fire would protect us and give us the coals for roasting the fish. We told the Indians that they should immediately take care of the fishing: they were masters at that; we would go to look for firewood... So it was done: our job was very easy: firewood is not lacking in the thicket; we piled up enough and afterwards remained watching the Indians with their lines cast into the dark-green waters of the river ... By the movement of the lines, held surely in the Indians' hands, one could see perfectly that the fish were abundant and that they were biting constantly. In those moments the superattention of the sylvicolists was remarkable ... Suddenly, a line becomes taut; the Indian, alert, gives the pull of a master; the fish is caught on the hook. The savage makes a Herculean effort to conquer the resistance which the fish puts up against being brought to the surface. All of us, curious, were waiting for the last pull which would put the fish on dry land ... At the instant when the flattened head of the fish emerged a few meters from the beach, the Indian, unexpectedly, lets go of the line, makes a jump backwards, turns his back to the river, runs a few 118 cont. steps in toward the beach, and remains motionless, covering his face with his hands ... The scene was so fast that, when we saw it, everything had already happened: the fish had gone away with the entire line. The other Indians gathered up their fishhooks, which they had in their hands, and, without saying a word, went to lie down near the fire. Disturbed, even more impressed by what we had witnessed, we asked the why of such great and harmful extravagance. After a few moments, as if not to seem ill-mannered, they answered quite low, barely to be heard: “ bope (spirit of the evil) Kidokia, pirarara (smooth-skinned fish of the nature of the jaú /Paulicea lutkeni/. These two words were sufficient to explain everything, and we did not inquire any further. Kidokia is a forbidden fish, it is the food reserved for the bope , the most vengeful of the evil spirits and the chief of all. Woe to the boróro who would have dared to pull such a fish from the waters! The spirit of evil would have punished him with sickness and death. As much as we insisted that they try fishing anew, it was impossible to convince them: they remained hungry and did not even want to drink water; such was the dread that seized them. We, however, did not abandon at least killing our thirst; as for the rest, we had to resign ourselves to our bad fate.

       "  'Informants report experiencing a variety of sensed states as a disease process begins. Among these are depression (mental), cough, dry throat, diarrhea, fever, vomiting, stomach ache, loss of appetite, swelling, headache. At this stage in the disease process, no one, least of all the patient, knows what developments of successive units of time will be like. That is, the patient may have a headache and it will disappear (that is, no longer be reported) in some successive unit of time. On the other hand, the headache may be compounded with a stomach ache in some successive unit of time, resulting in a redefinition of the disease process. Generally speaking, sensed states which occur early in the disease process and which are not divisible into other sensed states are equivalent to symptoms , whereas sensed states which occur later in the disease process and which are a sum of other sensed states may be equivalent to illnesses .

We do, however, recall a few cases in which sick men claim to have received such powers; but none of the more important rituals are assigned to such origins. The attitude toward alcoholic intoxication is uncertain because there seems to have been a gradual moral awakening to its evil effects, which may account for the present tendency to consider experiences so induced as of no particular consequence.

Paredes' belief that these attitudes result from missionary teaching is almost certainly incorrect. 3 Paredes, 1936, 228-229. Far from being so uncomplicated, the explanation of this fear of the dead is complex, and several component beliefs must be considered independently. First, the corpse itself, as well as associated objects, is thought to be a potential source of a certain disease, orixa , to which children are particularly susceptible. Second, all ghosts of adults, irrespective of the dispositions of their former earthly counterparts, are naturally malevolent, and may send disease or, according to folk tales, cause death in other ways. 4 Informants were undecided as to whether or not children produced ghosts; at any rate, the ghosts of children (if they exist) are not feared (11, 43). Finally, the souls of the dead, either out of sheer jealousy of the living, or because of loneliness, frequently attempt to drag relatives and friends along with them to the hereafter. 1 As is shown below, it is close relatives who are most apt to be harmed by the dead. Similarly, it should be noted, in cases of sorcery the first suspicion of guilt falls upon close relatives. Indeed, as lias been demonstrated, the Aymara today is forced to compete for his very livelihood with his close relatives. It seems possible, therefore, to regard this fear of corpses, ghosts, and souls in part as a projection of repressed hostility towards parents and near relatives into the realm of the dead. This is especially true of the souls of children, and many omens are interpreted to mean that the deceased child desires the death of a sibling. 2 Perhaps this belief is to be understood as a projection of sibling rivalry, a phenomenon of which the Aymara themselves are well aware. There is, on the contrary, no evidence whatever from Chucuito to indicate that the dead ever seek to benefit the living (except to warn them of impending disaster) or that souls are regarded as guardians or protectors. 3 Paredes writes that the souls of the dead are believed to watch over and protect their relatives and the community as a whole; while they never abandon their kinsmen, these souls may punish the living if they deserve it. Paredes, 1946, 211-212. Indeed, the return of the souls during All Saints fiesta in November is believed to prevent rain when it is most meeded and the exposed bones of the dead are thought to cause drought (2). It is also desirable to slaughter livestock for meat before All Souls day, since the returning souls are said to steal the fat of these animals (43).\",\n",
       "  'God then in Somali eyes is remote, all-powerful, judging, and just. Men turn to Him in sorrow and distress as well as in joy and thanksgiving. He is the ultimate focus of causation, the ultimate source of life: men, for instance, ‘beget’ children, but God ‘creates’ them. Sickness and health, ill-fortune and good, exist only with His consent and are ultimately in his control to withhold or bestow. Luck ( nassiib ) is in the gift of God; and although magico-religious procedures are resorted to to remove sickness or to palliate it, misfortune and illness are rarely ascribed to the action of sorcery or witchcraft. These themes indeed emerge only in a few special contexts and are relatively unimportant in Somali life as a whole.',\n",

       "  \"Boys and married men frequently shave their heads so that the hair is scarcely more than an inch long.

Hair style el babet. a sharpened little piece of sheet iron which is called ol moronja (Fig. 62). Before the shaving the hair is moistened with water. The head is usually shaved during the es sobia days, the 18th to 20th day of the month, so that on the unlucky day, ol onjugi , the 17th day of the month, the head is not bald. The shorn hair is tossed into the thorn fence of the kraal. Beard hair and such lashes that grow back into the eye are plucked out with tweezers (Fig. 63 [ ol bud et ]). An exception to this is made by the men of the El kiboron lineage, who are not permitted to pluck out their beard hair because otherwise they would lose their power, in particular the supernatural one that enables them to bring and to conjure away rain. 147 cont. Axillary hair 148 and eyebrows are shaved. Women also shave the pubic hair, whereas men pluck it out with the fingers or tweezers. Young warriors let the hair grow and, when it has the necessary length, twist it between two fingers, through which apparently arise little balls, which, on closer inspection, prove to be spirals interlaced and rolled together. Somewhat later it is twisted together into strands ( ol babet, el babet ) with red paint, a mixture of animal fat and red earth, which hang entangled around the head. Furthermore they are lengthened by twisting in fibers of the bark of the baobab ( ol m es er a ) and of another tree called ol retéti , in order to form out of that the braid-coiffure peculiar to the Masai warriors, but adopted by many neighboring tribes (Fig. 64, 65, 66 [ ol daiga, el daigan ]). For this the hair is parted crosswise over the head from ear to ear, and then that of the front half of the head is divided into three parts, one over the forehead, the other two at the 148 cont. temples, whereupon the tips of the strands are wrapped with bast to the length of an inch. The back hair, lengthened up to 50 centimeters, is placed around a foot-long stick and on this wrapped tightly with bast or goat leather scraped thin, so that it forms a stiff braid ( ol daiga ) reaching to the waist. Over this braid one not infrequently finds one to three smaller ones. Often the tips of the little temple braids (sing. ol babeda; el babed l e n goscho ) are joined with that of the little forehead braid ( ol babeda l e n gomum ) and the former tied together under the chin with a string (made of fibers) 1 This hair style has the purpose of protecting the head from the harmful influences of the sun's rays. For that, one first let the hair grow long and, since the long strands fell annoyingly into the face at every movement, put it together into “braids.” The Tatoga helped themselves more simply, in that they shaved the front part of the head and left the protection of the thick padding of hair at the back part of the head. .

The technique of “blowing” has, oddly enough, full magical efficacy in the hands of the layman but is altogether uncertain when used by a medicine man. The point, of course, is that the layman uses simple magic against a manageable nonhuman adversary, whereas the medicine man is called in to pit himself against a formidable human adversary. The human adversary is formidable in Cubeo eyes for two reasons: it acts out of directed passion and it is devious. The nonhuman spirit world, by contrast, is stirred up to a generalized anger. The river anaconda is angered at newborn children and at menstruating women but not at any particular child or woman. The anger of spirits is, finally, direct.

       "  'The principal cultural mechanism for any economic, social, or religious activity is priestly divination. Divinatory techniques are many and consist of simple yes-or-no alternatives, but often take the form of complex interpretations of signs and symbols, such as the reading of cloud formations, animal voices, or the shape and number of air bubbles rising from a tubular necklace bead which has been submerged in water. Other mechanisms are muscle twitching, deep meditation, and the listening to sudden sounds or voices from within. Divination is practised mainly to ascertain whether or not a certain action is fesible. The decision may concern the planting of a crop, the clearing of a field, or any aspect of a wide range of major or minor alternatives of resource management, housing, family affairs, travel, trade, or other activities. People must continually consult these priestly oracles in order to have their actions guided by divination; should they disregard these rules, symptoms of illness will soon come to express the displeasure of the divine forces and the priests will impose penalties which, occasionally, can be very harsh. Priestly divination undoubtedly introduces a random element (Moore, 1965) but much of it appears to be manipulated and the final decision most often represents a personal choice made by the priest. This is almost always the case in matters of mate selection; in agricultural and general subsistence decision making, divination is an effective device in ecological planning because the priest’s practical environmental knowledge is truly outstanding. Priestly divinations provide guidance not only for small-scale decisions in daily life but may determine major strategies such as the foundation or relocation of settlements, the intensification of a certain crop, or the nature of trade relationships with neighbouring creole settlers. The effectiveness of this, to a large degree, ritually controlled agro-ecosystem (Rappaport, 1969) is recognized by most Kogi Indians. In fact, the underlying reason why Kogi culture has been able to resist harmful change, is that it gives a strong backing to priestly authority.',\n",

Moreover it is even possible to apply a quantitative test and show that the more important the place a thing occupies in the social life the greater is the degree of protective power attributed to it. Finally I shall be able to show that as different materials are used for special purposes so they are supposed to have certain special powers of protection against certain sorts of danger.

To the mind of the Andaman Islander, therefore, the social life of which his own life is a fragment, the social well-being which is the source of his own happiness, depend upon the possession of fire, without which the society could not exist.

By the Ariki Tafua he was invoked under the name of Feke in the kava, in particular for the sacred oven in his canoe yard. As the husband of the Tafua goddess Nau Fiora ( op. cit ., p. 123), he was adjured to furnish a material contribution in the form of a shark or other large fish. The Ariki Tafua identified Feke with the sun and said that he invoked the god also under the title of the Sacred Ray (Kaveitapu). I did not obtain titles of Feke from the kava of the other two chiefs. Pae Sao told me that the title used by the Ariki Fangarere was Black Ray (Kaveiuri), and by Pa Fenumera of Fangarere I was told that Te Urungaru (ordinary term for headache) was a title for Feke used by a former chief of that clan. The Ariki Taumako, who did not invoke Feke in his normal kava, did so, however, when he performed the kava in Niukapu, a lineage offshoot from the chiefly lineage of Taumako, which had settled in Faea long ago. Pa Niukapu explained to me in 1929 that since the autochthonous Nga Faea had been expelled ( History and Traditions of Tikopia , pp. 136 et seq .) their deities were invoked and appeased in the kava of his lineage lest people be devoured by them in revenge: ‘lest we be eaten by the atua , exasperated because of their men who were slain’. By ‘eaten’ he meant afflicted with illness and death. So when the kava formula was recited the deities of Nga Faea were invoked first and those of Taumako subsequently. The first title ‘lifted’ was Feke, then came Taukaveivaru, which he said was a collective term for the rays of Feke. ‘His rays are gathered together and are made his sons, eight rays collectively.’ This explanation reconciled to some extent the discrepancy noted earlier whereby various elders translated titles such as Kaveitoto as being the names of other deities than Feke. Pa Niukapu said that a famous ancestor of his, a noted sea voyager ( Work of the Gods , p. 377), had gone at his death to Nukutureki, a dwelling of Feke beneath the ocean, and that this name formerly had been applied to an open space near his house (where later the church of St Mary stood).

On the one hand, there are those who have a specific status entitlement -- ritual elders of lineages ( matapure ) and especially chiefs of clans ( ariki ) -- to care for the welfare of their group members. But while Tikopia is rigid in its adherence to the principle of patrilineal descent, it does not confine spiritual benefits so closely, and custom allows help to be obtained by resort to another than one's own lineage or clan head. (This custom has an advantage in that it is part of the mechanism of organization in practice and theory to deal with failure.) On the other hand, “magic” of protection can also be performed by persons of another social category, the spirit mediums ( vaka atua ). For practice in this capacity no particular status is required, only the ability to enter a state of dissociation and give the appropriate social responses. Here is an opportunity for women. No woman can be a chief or a ritual elder, 6 The status of “Female chief” -- Ariki fafine, is a special one, with social functions, and ritual significance, but without the political control and ritual duties of the normal male chief. but it is not uncommon for women, of ordinary as well as chiefly families, to be spirit mediums. Nor is this thought abnormal, or disapproved of, and they attend male as well as female patients. The “magical” procedures of protection and healing are more highly specialized and individualized than those of production. Much of them is common knowledge in the society at large, but the practitioners are regarded as having the special entitlement by status or capacity which secures them from imitation. No-one would use a procedure he had just “picked up”, as he might with some “magic” of production.

The message in folk-terms is more concrete, compact, and familiar to the client, and thus is more easily understood and accepted. Although the interpretation may be “supernatural” and not “rational” from a modern scientific point of view, it is more meaningful and useful to the client. Also, there is psychological significance in citing a supernatural power as the cause of the client's problem. A devil or a ghost can merely be the external aspect of any person in a real-life situation. However, such an interpretation is more easily tolerated and accepted by people who live in a society where close relationships between family members are maintained and overt conflict between persons is prohibited. A successful shaman knows how to make use of his sensitive perception to discern the client's problems, and also knows how to give advice relevant to his client's cultural background.\",\n",
       "  'However, in the Hubeer case, the category of the wild and unknown is not found in the boundary between otherwise unambiguous categories, as suggested by the theories of Douglas (1966) and Leach (1964). Rather, the ambiguous is defined as an inherent part of the world view where it opposes concepts of the familiar and known. The duur (bush) is both the domain of wild animals and of health restoring plants. Plants themselves can be used for malicious as well as healing purposes. Similarly, the system of cosmic correspondences suggested in the therapies based on the Sufi traditions, have the character of truths which have been hidden in the world by God. Strangers, although they may be potential enemies are also those with the most powerful medicines. Whether it is dressed in the shape of social, spatial or temporal categories, the contrast between the familiar and the unknown pervades Somali culture, and the power of the unknown is not restricted to contexts of healing. Hypothetically, it could be suggested that “the incorporation of the unknown” for healing purposes parallels the incorporation of strangers into southern Somali clans. Strangers, shisheeye, no matter how ambiguous they may appear, are a resource that adds to the numbers and prestige of the adopting lineage. The suggestion of such an analogy, if further substantitated, could help to account for the differences between southern Somali medicine and some other African medical traditions that I have pointed to above.',\n",

(62) Among the Selk'nam there is a well-developed “social welfare,” which attends to not only orphans and the sick, but also widowed and needy persons. This has already been confirmed (p. 680). For illustration I add an observation by Spegazzini (a):175, who remembers a very old man who was accompanied everywhere by his grandson. The life of the individual person stood and stands in special estimation among those around him, which is why atonement is always demanded for a murder and harsh revenge is taken (p. 629). If an inveterate thief (p. 622) or a person who betrayed the Kloketen secret (p. 1273) was murdered, the generality consented to it, with a view toward warding off greater harm. Suicide seems never to have been practiced (p. 686). (63) Cf. Gallardo:133. Calvi:51 writes very generally: “Gli Ona considerano mancanze gravi l'omicidio volontario, escluso, ben inteso, quello commesso in guerra /The Ona consider voluntary manslaughter a grave offense, except, of course, that committed in war/.” Precisely like life itself, one also prized health and, if necessary, reached for remedies . Feuerland /Tierra del Fuego/ offers only very few of these; true medicinal plants are lacking altogether, (64) The fact that medicinal herbs and minerals are not present at all on the Great Island is shown by a study of the country and its flora and fauna. Dabbene (b):260, Del Turco (BS; 1904), Gallardo: 302, and others expressly confirm this. Only Holmberg (a):59 mistakenly and without specific references speaks of “ramas de plantas medicinales /branches of medicinal plants/.” Just like European pleasures, for “they have a horror of tobacco or other druggs / sic /” /quoted in English/ (Barclay [a]:74), they also reject medicines, which usually taste bitter and for that reason alone do not please them (p. 1068). and the Selk'nam as well as the Haus make do with other things.

       "  \"3. Before the coming of the Japanese, there were no plague-like diseases on Taiwan, but recently a number of people have died from this kind of diseases. This is the punishment of the god Kuan Kung. For this reason as Japanese become more numerous, the Taiwanese become fewer in number. There is a direct relationship in the number of deaths of Taiwanese and the number of Japanese on the island. This is because Kuan Kung hates the Japanese. This being the case, Taiwanese must not on any account fraternize with Japanese. This kind of ignorant nonsense of course has not one iota of value, but the stupid common people can be affected by such empty words and their hearts moved. Accordingly let us make a more thorough investigation of the manner in which the spirit writing cult was propagated. It is certain that the most frenzied activity was in Taichung province. From about April of 1902, the cult overran Miao-Li , Tung-Shih , Chang-Hwa Lu-Kang , Pei-T'ou , Pei-Kang , etc. By mid-June it had penetrated to the area of the north of Tainan, i.e. Chia-Yi . Officials earnestly discussed measures to stem the tide, but there was no easy way to do this. By the end of July the cult had reached as far as Ma-Tou (near Tainan). At this time the police office in Ma-Tou forbid the spirit writing cult to meet. By making the utmost efforts, the officials were able to dampen the movement a little. From then on the southern penetration of the cult began to slacken. It was not until August or September that the cult reached the southern end of the island. When it entered the Heng-Chun district, its fury was visibly less, and the bad effects comparatively lighter. But in the Pescadores, a strong impulse emanated from the Tainan area. Gaining the endorsement of several sympathizers, the cult was established in the temples of the fortress of MaKung. On the basis of its reputation for curing opium addicts, a great number of addicts assembled there and before the gods made a vow to quit the habit. Daily the number of pilgrims grew more numerous, but suppression was so effective that by the end of August 1902, the cult had practically ceased activity.

       "  'There is a further conclusion to be drawn here that is somewhat surprising. It is often demonstrated that African medical therapy looks at the whole of the patient and his social situation. An abnormal symptom is referred back to social relations in the immediate environment and the therapy is aimed at restoring these relations to a normal condition (see e.g. Ayoade 1979; Conco 1979; Dawson 1979). Famous, too, is Evans-Pritchard’s example of how the Zande choose to regard only domestic plants as materia medica (1937: 448). Even where this may not be directly the case, healing is “in any event, organically bound up with basic political and economic processes” (Feierman 1985:116), thus echoing what the same author calls “the social roots of health and healing”. Certainly such trends can also be traced in Somali medical practices, but as we have seen here a dominant trend is not to seek for remedies in the familiar and mundane. 9 . Some such techniques that seek to relate the affliction of the person to social relational problems seem to be less concerned with the healing as such and are better thought of as “divination”. This applies to, for instance, the fal or soothsaying (cf. fallow, “soothsayer”) which is obviously what Antoniotti has in mind when he writes “at the beginning of every therapy, the sick person must recognize the source of the illness” (1984:160). Rather, it is by drawing upon the explicitly wild, the strange and the unknown that one attempts to restore health. Significantly, Tresalti reports from a village in southern Somalia that the absence of privacy at modern clinics inhibits many people from choosing that type of therapy (1984:205). This suggests that healing may be regarded as something inherently private, something which deliberately should be concealed from the eyes of the public.',\n",
       "  \"Thus, for example, each of the years in the sixty year cycle is supposed to be controlled by a heavenly bureaucrat, the “god of the year” ( Thai-soe ). In the case described above it could be said that one or more of the victim's eight characters anger the god of the year who then dispatches ghosts to afflict the victim. The naturalistic interpretation offers grounds for prescribing medical treatments by means of traditional herbal remedies. The explanation in terms of angry spirits opens the possibility of ritual curing. An angry god of the year, for example, can be propitiated or the ghosts he sends to afflict his victim can either be bribed or otherwise forced to leave the victim alone.\",\n",
       "  'Agressions against strangers, however, are not punished and instead are regarded as suitable conduct. The lack of economic collaboration is severely punished in the following situations: husband-wife, parents-children, sons-in-law -- fathers-in-law, but it is considered a minor offense when other combinations between persons or families are involved. Lies or defamations are generally regarded as examples of diplomacy and justified caution, but are not offenses properly speaking. Unadapted individuals, or those who conduct themselves in an unusual or extravagant manner in the culture, are not considered as offenders, but are fully responsible in case of a direct infraction. Malevolent magic does not exist as an aggressive action. Offenses against property are always interpreted in terms of food and are punished severely whenever it is a question of thefts of foodstuffs, fruits, or domestic animals. Thefts of utilitarian objects occur frequently, but are considered of less importance. The principal political offense is treason. An individual may be accused of treason if he maintains friendly contacts with strangers who are not natives and communicates religious knowledge to them or takes them to sacred sites or gives them ceremonial objects. In these cases they may go as far as capital punishment. Sexual offenses include masturbation, prenuptial sexuality, adultery, incest, homosexuality, contacts with animals, and obscene language. Coitus must be done in 146 certain places, intervals, and positions; and certain personal rites must be observed in relation with it. Religious offenses, finally, include innumerable actions, and ultimately every offense, no matter what it is, is interpreted in religious terms, especially if it is a matter of negligence in offerings and personal rites, in rites of purification, fasts, diet, and sexual abstinence. The concept of immunity does not exist for any person. Suicide is considered a social and religious offense, since the individual is thus trying to escape from his responsibilities. Offenses are brought to public knowledge through direct accusation by the person offended, occasionally assisted by members of his family, without their necessarily being affected by the offense. Public opinion can similarly exercise sufficient pressure to bring a collective accusation before the authority. Another means of ascertainment would be the confession of the delinquent, which in serious cases may obligatorily be repeated in public. The Kogi do not only consider evident acts as offenses, but also thoughts and intentions. Thinking about adultery is as serious as the consummated act, and the individual who thought about stealing a yuca is as guilty as if he had in fact stolen it. These thoughts, like all offenses, must be confessed periodically to the máma, and, in order that this confession be truthful and detailed, he has the backing of supernatural punishment with illnesses. The Kógi have a great fear of sickness and death and are concerned daily about possible pathological symptoms. Thus confession is really an extremely efficient means of control, since the eventual punishment will not be carried out in some remote beyond, but immediately. After having fasted, spent the night awake, and confessed for hours, the individual, very understandably, will feel a headache. This ache is immediately interpreted as a punishment for not having confessed well, and the same individual will go back again to the máma to repeat his confession and to scrutinize his mind, trying to remember the slightast offenses, in order to communicate them to the máma and thus free himself of all evil. Thus the máma, by means of confession, can ascertain all of the offenses which they commit, committed, or intend to commit in his town. Nonetheless, an individual can never be accused by means of divination, and it can only be applied to a collectivity. A máma could punish an entire town 147 with fasts, offerings, or other abstinences, if he divined that the collective conduct was not suitable.',\n",

At times these bindings contain little black beads, and the Máma also gives the father some little dry seeds which are pierced so that they may later be put around the baby’s neck in the form of a small necklace. The baby is given a small totuma /vessel made out of the fruit of Crescentia cujete / containing sugar-cane water to drink, and with this act the “baptism” is considered ended.

Good speech only is made to her. The basis of the father's sister is the father. I do not speak evilly to my father, nor do I speak evilly to his sister, my aunt. I again do not speak evilly to the child of my father's sister. It is done in this fashion because she is of weight. Should I speak evilly to my father and my father's sister, when my father's sister dies, and I have spoken evilly to her, then it reacts and I become ill. That is its basis.

What is sought is to rupture the envelope and to reincorporate the patient into normal life. There is one single word — mahsári —meaning to cure and to be born. Moreover, it is believed that, in order to produce a rebirth, it is necessary in many cases to symbolically effect coitus with the patient, an act which introduces into his organism an element of vitality and growth. These two concepts, that of the patient conceived as a foetus and that of the cure as a birth produced by a new coitus, are based on the underlying assumption that the illness itself was caused by a sexual act, a kind of contagious insemination. The sex of the sick person is not taken into account under these circumstances for it is believed that all sick people have an essentially feminine character.

If a king lived in a capital where he frequently fell ill, he would build a new capital at the advice of the medicine men or of the gods or of his chiefs or of his own accord. Kings Tebandeke, Kamaanya and Mutesa I’s illnesses may be quoted as examples. King Kyabaggu’s decision to settle in Busoga was partly influenced by his belief that there was a ghost in Buganda which tormented him. “Let my sons take over the kingdom” he said; “myself I shall stay in Busoga. I will not return to the country where there is a ghost which wants to kill me.” Sometimes, a king would change his capital for strategic considerations.

Literally: female hill = mound of Venus. ) of the wife of Songela ” runs the description of a cohabitation ( 11, 10). 121 But the general designation gazahi, gaitsahi (to practice cohabitation), expresses the process more clearly, for the literal translation says: to eat excrement, from gai, ga (excrement) and zahi (to eat). Cf. also gai-misi, ga-misi (to make excrement) and huízi misi (to make urine). That is why the female sex organ is also called gaimiskuí (that which makes excrement) or sotá (= sautá ) [the eating, the food]).

Sometimes it is extremely expansible and can be stretched into a very long thread, like a strip of rubber, approximately to the breadth of an arm-span. Occasionally I heard: “The kwáke hurled toward a certain person by a n is like an arrow point. This penetrates into the body. It settles in a certain spot and grows so that the person feels pain. In the body it usually acts like a living animal, like a cururo, rat, or beetle, like a lizard, dog, or young bird.

       "  'With these same directions are associated the winds, and with these in turn definite colors and attributes, which are also associated with rain showers ( 1 . The Kógi say: “There are rain showers of every color, but the color is not visible. The dark showers are bad. At the end of the World, showers of all colors will fall, and then they will be visible.” ). The wind from the East is white and good; the wind from the West is black and bad; the wind from the North is blue and bad, and the wind from the South is red and may be good or bad. These winds are imagined as women wearing long skirts, who come dancing from the four directions where they have their homes, each bringing certain gifts. Thus the wind from the East “brings good,” the wind from the West “brings evil,” the wind from the North “brings sickness,” and the wind from the South “brings the heat.” These qualities, the good, the bad, sickness, and heat, are thought of as substances, and, in fact, it is said that these substances cling to the clothing of the four women and spread from them like “seeds.” The winds thus have the character of fertilizing forces in a benign and malignant sense. There are many mythical examples which express this concept. Thus, for example, Búnkua-se blows on Kashindúkua, when the latter falls unconscious, and makes him revive; then he blows upon the bones of Kashindúkua and again resuscitates him. Tamiséi blows upon the bones of Sekuishbúchi and revives them; the breeze blows on Duginávi, the solar hero, when he comes forth, unconscious, from the sea monster and brings him to life. In the myth concerning the creation of the first man, it is said of the Universal Mother: Blowing, she gave him life.” But this same blowing can also be a defensive action: Sangaraména blows into the eye of his enemy Matúna and converts him into a blue ball; the máma who protected Námaku blows against the attacking enemies and transforms them into fruits of the field, which Námaku eats ( 1 . Cf. the myths of Kashindúkua, Námaku, Sekuishbúchi, and Duginávi /see 2: Reichel-Dolmatoff in this file/. ). “To blow” sometimes has the direct meaning of “to sow.” The fine mineral dust of which many offerings consist and which represents “seed” is sometimes placed on the hand and blown into the air, either so that it will penetrate in a certain direction or so that it will impregnate the soil of a certain place. The lime powder which is mixed with the 252 coca is similarly blown into the air in order to attract rain ( 2 . Cf. “Religion,” offerings. ). All sickness is regarded as having been brought by the winds, and it is especially the humid wind from the sea, the “blue wind,” which is considered the most dangerous of all. The association of the directions with good or bad events is similarly expressed in various myths. In the creation myth it is said that the “End of the World” lies beyond the Magdalena River, in the West. Aldauhuíku, a culture hero, came from the East. In the West lived the evil Ubatáshi and other mythical tribes who were considered to be endowed with evil magical powers. In the myth of Duginávi it is said that his body was carried to Guajira where it was buried, and, of course, seen from the Kógi habitat, Guajira is the place where the sun is reborn each day.',\n",

From the reports of medical acquaintances and my own observations, the following diseases are known to me: catarrhal, gastric, and rheumatic fevers, pneumonia, diseases o the heart, liver, and gall bladder, consumption, cancer of the throat, uterus, and stomach, and diseases of the eye... Slight inflammations of the eye are cured very successfully by licking the pus from under the eyelid with the tip of the tongue. Sometimes this is done by particular specialists who have a particularly soft and thin tongue. People come purposely to the houses of such people and pay as much as thirty kopecks for an operation. Despite the abundance of water, swamp fever is comparatively rare; sufferers are cured by frightening them, or pouring cold water over them; even oftener they are not treated at all. Fever belongs to that class of diseases against which shamanism acknowledges itself to be powerless. Rheumatism is extremely widespread; finally, the terrible disease, contraction of the throat, is not a rarity; its victims die a death from hunger. This malady is apparently found most often in those places where cattle raising is the exclusive occupation, where the supply of wild animals has been exhausted and they do not raise grain; I think it appears as a result of eating liquid foods exclusively. Besides this, it is a rare Yakut who does not suffer from tape-worm or round worm - a result of eating meat that is raw or not sufficiently cooked; the local cattle suffer equally severely from these parasites.

Old ones . They wash them many times with the water in which has been boiled the water-edge cipo called Mõõ öx’sé-kapoarí (paraiba whiskers). 289 b) Against snake bite . 1st. Of Jararaca : they crush the leaves and the yellowish root of a shrub called precisely Añakó , jararaca remedy, and for this reason they cultivate it in the clearings. They apply them to the bites, and the sap or infusion of these leaves is also given as a drink. A variety of black root has an even more vigorous action. They also use the infusion of the sororoca root against the poison of the jararaca. For snake bites in general, they drink the sap of a cipo called P ï rõ-dá (snake cipo), with a thick stem and abundant and pleasing sap, which they likewise use to quench their thirst when walking through the forest. In spite of these remedies of theirs, every year there is a certain number of victims of the snakes, and if this number is not larger they owe it to the remedies and serums obtained from the Mission. c) For toothache . They use a plant that burns like pepper, Pixkõ-kó , remedy-for-teeth. They burn the leaves and apply the ashes to the aching tooth. d) For sore eyes . 1st. If it is a matter of children, they scrape the bark of the minhoca cipo, Ahwã-da , leave it in infusion in mother’s milk or, lacking this, in water, and afterwards they put some drops in the ailing eye, using a small funnel made out of arumã leaf. For an identical purpose, and with the same process, they also use the guapuí , a parasitic plant with long aerial roots. When the patient is an adult person, they apply to the eye, in drops, an infusion made from the root of the cipo Waxsyã-dá , after it has been washed well and grated. They also apply salt to the ailing eyes, pure or mixed with well-pulverized chicken manure. Probably the use of salt would be a suggestion from the civilized, applied, however, according to the native concept. e) For dysentery . They mix the latex of the plant Yoá-motõ with water and take it warm. Or they eat tapioca mixed with the latex of the cipo Pixkõ-s e- dá (cipo of the bird “tesoura” / Muscivora tyrannus /). f) For stomach-ache .

       "  'From birth to walking the Hausa infant appears to be regarded not so much as an immature member of society, but rather as the material from which, with the proper treatment, a member of society may ultimately be produced, and the adult’s function is not so much to care for the personal needs of the baby, as to do to the baby those things which will ensure its entering society in proper condition. First, then, the baby must be prepared ritually. Morning and evening ritual washing will continue for forty days, three days after birth the tribal marks are incised and the uvula removed, and seven days after birth, when the child is given its name, a Malam intercedes with Allah and asks him to protect it, while the maternal and paternal lineages express their goodwill towards it. Beyond this the parents will usually provide a number of charms to be worn round the baby’s neck or loins, but the number and kind is not rigidly prescribed. Next, the baby must be prepared physically, that is, it must be given enough food to ensure its growth, it must be given appropriate treatment if it is ill, and it must be protected from physical harm. After the first few weeks it will also receive its first training leading to sphincter control by being held in the proper position for defaecation. There is no attempt at super-ego formation during this period, there is no aura of “good” or “bad” either explicit or implied, and the emphasis is on the skill of the adult in so arranging things that only the desired results are obtained. A crying baby is a grave reflection on the mother, and the slightest whimper results in the baby being offered the breast, often in fact having the breast thrust upon it so that it is forcibly fed and promptly brings it all up again as soon as its mouth is free. So that, though in the main it is true that the baby gets what he wants by crying for it, he also receives badness from the mother even in conditions where the ideas of punishment and training are absent.

In Somaliland there is a fairly well-developed ritual of exorcism conducted mainly by women who have previously suffered from the disease who are considered to have ‘authority’ over the spirit. Such a woman is called alaqa . The exorcism of the spirit—which may not be permanent—and the treatment of the disease are usually conducted by these women who charge very considerable fees. The saar spirit is held to like all good things; all luxuries, perfumes, fine clothes, dates, coffee etc., and livestock are sometimes also killed so that blood may be given to appease the spirit.

       "  'The remaining festivals of the Santal year do not make the same stir throughout the countryside. Mokor is the name used in the area by Santals and non-Santals alike for the festival which takes place in mid-January. In some places it is called the Sakrat . At this time offerings are made to the ancestors in each house, and the celebration is accompanied by a display of stick dancing, which has replaced the former “sword and shield” dance. At the end of the following month the Mag Sim, the hen at the end of the month of Mag, is offered. In former times the village officials used to resign at this time and could be either replaced or reappointed, but the only relic of the old practice that has survived is that the headman has to treat the whole village to beer. Contracts with servants are renewed during the festival, and they receive the cloth that is always a part of the contract. In connection with rice cultivation there is the Erok’ Sim, the hen that is offered at the time of sowing, and Nãwãi, when the first fruits of the first rice crop are offered in the sacred grove. Before this takes place the new rice must not be eaten. The village priest cuts the first handful of the crop and offers some at the foot of each of the chief trees. A sprig is also tied round the trunk of the trees and remains there. While the prayer is being said, milk is poured on the offering. After the priest has done his part, similar offerings are made in every house to the house spirits and the ancestors, the rice being taken from the crops belonging to the family. In varying degrees the Santals share in some of the festivals and practices of the low-caste cultivators around them. In the early monsoon days, during the period of Rohini, which is an auspicious time for sowing rice, they make a mark round their houses with cowdung as a protection against snakes. The snake goddess festival occurs in late August, and although its observance is not widespread among the Santals there are some local celebrations, especially when there is an ojha in the village. The ojhas all keep this festival, and others go to them at this time to ask for medicines against snakebite. Some Hindu festivals, as we have seen, furnish the occasion for large gatherings of Santals. At Sarenga, in addition to the Lakshmi Puja, a somewhat smaller gathering takes place during the hot weather in connection with the celebration of the Siva Gajon at a local temple. At this time the Charak, or hook-swinging festival, otherwise known as the Pata, takes place. The practice has almost died out within the last fifteen years. It had been prohibited by the government, but as long as the old generation, which was accustomed to the practice, remained it continued with gradually diminishing fervour. The Santals gather now to sing and to dance. They also join the throngs of pilgrims, sightseers and traders who collect at the Bogri mela, or fair, some thirty miles from Sarenga. This fair, which is one of the most famous in Western Bengal, takes place at the time of the Dol Jatra near a temple dedicated to Krishna. The last day of the mela is chiefly renowned for the fact that on that day there is a great concourse of Santals for dancing.',\n",
       "  'When the Santal ojha is called in about a case of sickness or of sudden death, his first function is to try to determine the type to which the particular misfortune belongs. He consults the oracles in order to discover whether natural causes are to blame, in which case it is called plain rua, or sickness, or whether it is necessary to lay the responsibility on a witch, a bonga or a displeased ancestor. He sits down in the courtyard and waits until two sarjom leaves and some mustard oil in a leaf cup are brought to him. Holding one of the leaves in his left hand, he dips his right index finger in the oil and sprinkles some drops on the ground as an offering to the spirits. While doing so he asks for guidance in determining the correct cause of the illness or fatality. He then puts a drop of oil into each of the compartments of the leaf that he is holding, one drop representing one possible agency of evil. There is one for natural causes, three or four for different bongas, and other drops represent households in which there may be a witch, including the sick man’s house, his father-in-law’s house, the houses on the other side of the village street, and so on. When the drops are in position the ojha rubs the two leaves together and then holds the first leaf up to the light to discern the shapes that have been taken by the oil. He pronounces the cause of the disease in accordance with the pattern that he sees. If he decides that the bongas are displeased, he performs the ceremony known as bul mayam in much the same manner as the village co-priest does during the festivals. The blood which he draws from his arm, chest or thigh is mixed with some sundried rice until the whole is saturated. The ojha then proceeds to scatter the rice on the ground and prays to the spirits to spare the sick man from further interference. He confirms his diagnosis by oracle by examining the patient and in particular by feeling his pulse, and apart from his power with the spirits he has a stock-in-trade that includes many remedies, spells, and also powers of exorcism. This is resorted to at once in certain cases such as snake bite. The ojha squats down beside the sick person and takes in his left hand a peacock feather or sometimes one or two twigs from an old broom, and these he passes along the patient’s body without touching it, moving from the head to the feet and chanting the correct spells as he does so.',\n",

The symptoms are headaches and swelling of parts of the body; sisongo affects the legs of the patient, siyaya and tundundu affect the chest or stomach. Divination shows the cause, and exorcism and skilled treatment by an ng'aka are required. These mahamba would appear to be true ancestral spirits for, according to informants, siyaya is known to have existed among the Lozi of Lewanika's reign in the early years of the century. Its acceptance by the luyana was such that Kuntz (1932.131) considered that it was a Lozi ailment. In Mankoya, on the other hand, Symon (1950, 72-73, 76-77) noted that liyaya appeared only to affect the immigrant Wiko ( lunda-luvale ) peoples of the district. He records that the exorcism is assisted, in cases of sisongo and liyaya , by medicine taken orally and by hot fomentations applied to the affected parts of the body. He does not, as does Kuntz, mention inhalations. Modern mahamba , such as, ‘ ndeke (aeroplane), which is derived by infection from areas where planes are frequently seen. This lihamba is said to cause weakness of the legs when walking (McCulloch, 1951.78), were also encountered during the investigation, and one of these, bindele , is fully discussed in Chapter VI.\",\n",

The story goes this way: Guo Ching has a son who lives in Taitung and who is already married. I have heard that this boy had struck up with a girl in Taitung who already had a husband, so her husband divorced her. Although the girl's husband had already divorced her, her husband's mother became very angry, and as a result fell sick and died. Before this old mother died, she was particularly angry with Guo Ching's boy because the latter had damaged their family. For this reason she used some superstitious method (the kind of [Taiwanese aboriginal] wizardry you photographed when you were in Taitung) to wound Guo Ching's son's wife. The objective was to cause his wife to become sick and die so that Guo Ching's son wouldn't have a wife. Not long afterward Guo Ching's son's wife took sick (a neurosis like the one Guo Tong-ming died of). Guo Ching's boy saw that his wife had already developed a neurosis and was terrified, so two weeks ago he sent his wife back to our village. After this woman got to our village, she upset the family every day, and struck people. So Guo Ching's family had three gods come down. Two [ tâng-ki ] were from our village: Guo Tian-huah [Third Prince] and Guo Ching-shoei [the Great Saint], and one tâng-ki from another village. I hear that these three gods used very peaceful means in taking care of this matter to implore the ghost who was bothering the woman's body to leave. Finally the three gods used impolite words and told the ghost who was bothering the woman's body that if she didn't leave, the three of them would be impolite to her. At length the ghost left, and the three gods [left and their tâng-ki ] sat down to rest. After the three tâng-ki had stopped, they had some refreshments, and when they had finished their refreshments the three left together to go home. But...they had only just arrived at the pond behind Guo Ching's house (for it was the road beside the village pond) when the ghost, who had been standing there waiting for them, struck the Third Prince's tâng-ki, Guo Tian-huah. Tian-huah was knocked to the ground by her, but just as the ghost was about to strike the other two tâng-ki their two gods possessed them, so they began to fight vigorously with the ghost. The two tâng-ki fought very boisterously [ Rehnaw ], sometimes chasing into the trees, sometimes onto a roof, sometimes chasing her through the fishpond. Finally that invisible ghost lost the fight and ran away.\",\n",

       "  'Social contrasts, however, separated the south people from their northern neighbors more effectively than did the natural conditions mentioned. There was always a certain tension and lurking irritability between the two. Though, to be sure, outward sociableness prevailed at times, serious hostility not infrequently broke out. This opposition arose rather unconsciously from economic causes. The north people subsisted primarily on the meat of the cururos and used the soft skins of these animals for cloaks. This prompted the south people to make fun of their northern neighbors and look down on them as “cururo eaters.” A transitory penetration of individual south-people into the north country never occurred for hunting purposes, much less, as Tonelli:9 believes, for the stealing of women, though a medicine man from the other region was not infrequently held responsible for sicknesses or cases of accidents and death. There is no reliable clue for guessing at the frequency of such disputes or hostilities. For all this was hidden from the eyes of the but recently arrived whites, and thereafter earlier conditions changed. Nevertheless, the missionaries felt this ancient hostility. They established their first settlements in the territory of the north people, who continued to prevent their southern neighbors from visiting the mission; as Beauvoir (BS: XX, 37; 1896) complains, “non si presentarona più in corpo di tribù intera, perchè quelli del Nord imposero loro con minaccie la partenza, e passato il Rio Grande, pare si siano scambiate alcune frecciate, lasciandovi alcuni anche la vita” /they no longer appeared in a body of the entire tribe, because those of the North forced departure on them with threats, and, having crossed the Rio Grande, it seems some arrows were exchanged, some persons even losing their lives/.',\n",

Water for washing the baby is heated in a pot by the fire until mildly warm. The mother then washes the baby from stem to stern with her hand rather than with a rag. In place of soap she uses c'opak root for the first year or so. Even the clothing of the infant cannot be washed in the river, although soap may be used for it, because the river would carry away the dirt and defecation from the clothes, bringing it far from the home of the child.

Sometimes before he is in sight, the patient declares the leech is coming, and refuses to have him, saying “the place smells bad,” referring to the medicine; he struggles. When the leech arrives, the patient tries to escape. As he is held down, he calls out the names of great grandparents, or forefathers, or Tutumatua, or the Wind Women.

There are also many fears resulting from traditional beliefs, such as the very great possibility, if one is successful in some venture, of being bewitched by others who are motivated by jealousy; or the fear of the coincidental, such events being thought to have been planned in some way. Large numbers of people in the rural as well as urban areas complain of persistent, diffuse symptoms which in Europe would be regarded as of neurotic origin. In an area where the prevalence of some form of parasitic infestation and anaemia is so high it is, of course, easy to treat such patients for something physical; having failed to experience a cure, the patient is unlikely to return to the out-patient clinic, but will continue with his round of private doctors if he has enough money to pay for the coveted injection. Neurotic conditions are hardly likely to be diagnosed by a doctor who has to see a hundred patients in a morning, as they file past in a line, many receiving aspirins and a purge, particularly when the doctor may have had no training whatsoever in psychiatry. Many symptoms are much more worrying to the patient than the doctor often realises, and attempts should be made to reassure patients about them. There is the fear that dizziness may lead to epilepsy, that a mild skin disease may turn into leprosy, that a persistent cough is tuberculosis or that a persistent headache is spoiling the brain. The consequent anxiety may aggravate the symptoms further so leading to severe neurotic disorder of a hypochondriacal nature.',\n",

Rituals of affliction are performed on a non-automatic basis and are prompted by the diagnosis of a spiritually caused illness. During such rituals the formerly ill administer to the currently ill, and so it is that religious status in the bori cult is achieved through affliction. Thus, as Turner observes, affliction has a double meaning: it is both a punishment for some kind of neglect or transgression-for bori spirits do not possess a victim without provocation-and it is evidence of a spirit’s selection of his victim as a cult member (1967: 10). But initiation also marks the transition from one social status to another, from outsider to insider, at least as far as cult membership is concerned. Most social transitions fall under the heading of life-crisis rituals (birth/naming, marriage, death) and are concerned with ascribed statuses, but the bori initiation is a ritual applied to an achieved status.',\n",

After a short while he takes them up again, salutes and removes the covering leaf; after having scrutinized the leaf, he announces the result. It is unnecessary to say that the ojha arranges the result, and that he does it according to what he understands is the common opinion of those who have engaged him.

At the apacheta on leaving a town, the parents cry “[child's name] hutani hutakim haniu qeparatati!” (“Come! Come now! You must not stay”) so that the child's soul will not linger behind. Sometimes when a child is sick they believe that its soul has been “caught” ( katatau ) by the spirit ( kata ) of the road, a church, a certain field, river, lake, or mountain. If it is “caught” by the earth ( oraqen katatau ), there has to be a trukaqaña to “change the health.” This is an offering of colored wools, candy, coca leaves, etc., which is left at the spot by a yatiri or laliri doctor, and a traveller should avoid this offering if he sees it at a crossroad lest he be endangered thereby. Sometimes a child has a multa (“fright”) and falls at a certain spot; then they ask it “where did you fall?” and take some earth from that spot and give it to the child to eat so that it will not become sick. Another remedy is the milucana ritual. In this a piece of milu or alum is placed on the sick child's chest, left there two or three hours, and then rubbed all over its body. After this the alum is put in a large bowl or lamota of putrified urine, covered up with a cloth, and taken out at the end of twenty to thirty minutes. The alum swells up into a sponge-like mass which the yatiri studies for a diagnosis. Then he says: “The child was frightened at this spring,” or “It will get well,” or “It will die.” When the augury is bad the yatiri takes a knife and cuts the mass with exorcisms, makes a hole in the ground and buries the milu .\",\n",

Since the masks are intended to portray all the living creatures of the Cubeo world the number of masks is potentially vast. No one ceremony uses them all. There are, however, key characters that are most commonly represented. These are Jaguar, Dung beetle, Carrion vulture, Butterfly, Aracú fishes, Eagle, Sloth, Parrot, Dragonfly, Minnows (who are not masked but are an important element in the ceremonial dramatization), Pyénkü (a small black fish), Frogs, and a variety of cannibalistic ogres or forest demons, the Abúhuwa . Informants would not say which of the masked representations was most important, presumably because invidiousness is, to the Cubeo, in poor taste. Judging, however, by their prominence, I would say that Jaguar, Butterfly, Abúhuwa, Dung beetles, Carrion vulture, and Aracú fishes were most important, more or less in that order. Except for the aracú, the esteemed fish of the region, these creatures all have an association with death. The jaguar is, of course, the dreaded sorcerer. The sorcerer is called yaví (jaguar) and the Cubeo regard any jaguar as likely to be either a sorcerer or a sorcerer’s dog. The morpho butterfly with its beautiful blue wings is a creature of sorcerers and of evil. The information Koch-Grünberg received was that the morpho butterfly ( tatárako ) lives at Yuruparí cachoeira on the Vaupés, where he brews malaria in a calabash and strews it over the land (1909, II, 181).

It is to be found in the fact that pig-arrows are used in fighting, so that the tree comes to have a special relation to the shedding of blood. Plumes of shredded Tetranthera wood (made from an old arrow-shaft) must be worn by a homicide during the period of “purification” as a protection against the dangers that are believed to threaten him because he has shed blood. The same plumes were formerly always carried in a dance preceding a fight, and at such times the natives used to rub their bows with the shredded wood in order to ensure success in battle. Thus it is clear that there is a special connection between this tree and the shedding of blood, due to the fact that pig-arrows, of which the shafts are made from it, are used in fighting as well as for killing pigs and other animals. It is probable that this is the explanation of the use of the leaves during the ceremony at a girl's first menstruation.\",\n",

Every person has a unique identity, based on the year, month, day and hour of his birth. In the traditional system of calendrical calculation, each year of the sixty year cycle is ruled over by a different ‘Lord of the Year’ ( Tai-Sui ). An individual born in a certain year may ‘clash’ with ( Ch'ung ) the Lord of that year, and thus make it necessary to ‘hide his fate’ ( kham un ), to avoid any unpleasant fate which might be in store for him. In this particular case, a man's fate had been ‘hidden’ earlier in the year, but it was felt that some mistake had been made and that the measure had been ineffective. So the gods were being asked to ‘hide’ it again this evening. The ‘fate’ was in a small ceramic jar, represented by a few grains of rice and beans, a few small nails, a coin or two, and a piece of red paper with the year, month, day and hour of birth of the individual written on it. The jar was covered with a piece of red cloth over the mouth, tied down with 12 strands of black thread. Pasted across the top was a ‘seal charm’ ( hong-hu-a ) made of a strip of yellow paper with a ‘charm’ written on it. A bamboo incense holder was tied to the side of the jar. In this case, the fate was thought to have escaped from the jar, thus allowing the Lord of the Year to see it and to make trouble for the involved. As a result, the man had become ill. The god directed that the seal and the red cloth should be removed and the jar placed on the sand planchette. The god used the peach branch to write a lengthy charm over the open mouth of the jar. He directed that the red cloth be re-tied, and while this was being done, the god called for the ‘red pen’ ( Hung-Tsu-Pi ) helper immediately took a writing brush which had been dipped in red ink and attached it to the end of the stylus. The god called for strips of yellow paper about an inch wide and six inches long, to be placed on the sand tray. He then wrote out three charms on the yellow paper with the ‘red pen’. These charms he had pasted over the top of the cloth covered jar to ‘seal’ ( Feng ) it. The peach branch (now bereft of the ‘red pen’) was used to trace another ‘charm’ in the air over the jar.

In my analysis of the rites, I have placed great emphasis on the significance of beeswax, an emphasis that reflects the importance that the Barasana attach to this substance themselves. Again, whilst I know that the ritual use of beeswax is common to all the Indian groups of the Pirá-paraná area, I cannot find any direct evidence for its use in Yurupary rites elsewhere. The Barasana burn beeswax on a number of occasions outside the context of Yurupary rites (see ch. 7) and it is significant that many other authors mention the use of ‘smoke from burning embers’, ‘resin and embers’, ‘burning resin’, ‘fumigation’, etc., in exactly these same contexts. Considering that the beeswax in question (cerumen) is made largely from resin, these references suggest that its ritual use may be more widespread than might at first be supposed. Whether or not beeswax is, or was, also used in the context of Yurupary rites I cannot say, but there is evidence from myth for the existence of something like the beeswax gourd amongst the Tukano (see ch. 7, nn. 22 and 30).

The disease is sometimes diagnosed in people suffering from tuberculosis or pneumonia and the general symptoms are coughing, sneezing, and vomiting with occasional lapses into unconsciousness. This ailment is treated by wadaads, particularly those who have previously suffered from it, who adjure the spirit to quit the patient by reading potent verses of the Quran and bathing him with perfume. Perfume in Somaliland has a ritual significance and is associated with religious celebrations.

The bope possesses a bari and eats the dishes in question with the bari's mouth. These spirits also appear in dreams and reveal the future, but they take no interest in the social life of the Indians and do not in any significant way figure in any myth. A bari becomes such through visitations of a bope. He must scrupulously observe the rules laid down to him on pain of loss of power and catching an incurable disease. However, the bope may render him invulnerable and give him the power to hunt game in the guise of a jaguar. The bari may inflict disease and death, but also cures and confers other benefits on the tribe. A client will offer him a cigar, whereupon the shaman calls on the bope, a number of whom led by a spokesman then possess him. In doctoring, the bari smokes the cigar, then the spokesman of the spirits asks why they have been called. One present explains, then the doctor sucks the afflicted parts, expectorating the putative cause, e. g., a beetle, which he scans, announcing his prognosis. Certain feminine diseases, however, he must not attempt treating lest he impair his supernatural powers.

All illnesses except those caused by Vaí-mahsë are produced by Vihó-mahsë who serves as an instrument. His field of action being the Milky Way, he is thus associated with the harpies and buzzards, consumers of all that is rotten and represents the essence of all that is sick and pathogenic.

Sore mouth, sore eyes, blindness, boils, etc., are generally regarded as resulting from such, and for anyone to be so afflicted is of itself evidence of such violations. Curiously enough, the violation, if such it be, cannot always be laid to the victim himself, since by social usage he may be forced to keep his seat while another is doing the very thing his medicine prohibits. For example, if metal must not be struck in the presence of a certain paintedtipi owner, it is not likely that he himself will violate the injunction, but he may be unable to prevent others from doing the striking.

Great numbers of people of all ages and both sexes assemble, and as the men of the community go to join this crowd they each grasp a weapon and on arrival at the scene brandish it fiercely.

The threatening gestures of the fakaveve are intended to frighten off any such evil-minded atua and so preserve the health of the land.

       "  'Illness gets into the body from the opening of the skin and orifices, and, correspondingly, it tends to show itself in malfunctioning of the skin and orifices. Stephen Hugh-Jones has shown, for instance, that when initiates are ritually opened up they are prone to a type of illness in which the body literally drains away through the excessively open anus (1979: 198ff). There are other ways in which illness is a repetition of events which precede it: some foods can introduce items of material equipment used in their production into the body and these implements attack the internal organs. Thus, if boiled maniocstarch drink is drunk on the wrong occasion (when the individual is ‘too open’), the stick that was used to stir it will stir up the s of the drinker. Again, there is a significant category of foods described as ‘grease-filling’. These are fatty foods, but more important seems to be the fact that they exude grease while cooking. When the individual eats these foods he or she is ‘filled with grease’ and then jaguars and snakes magically see the grease and perceive the eater as ‘edible game’ Thus, the food exudes grease while cooking and then the consumer exudes grease after eating. These examples illustrate the general principle that relations and processes outside the body can be transferred to the body itself.',\n",

When one of these illnesses strikes, a Western-style doctor is called in to administer penicillin or some other drug. The general feeling is that Western medicines, if they are appropriate for the illness, effect fast cures. While many villagers insist that Chinese medicines are just as effective if not more so in the long run, in that they produce a more permanent cure, they readily admit that Chinese medicines are slower to work than Western ones. If the Western medicines fail to help and the patient does not seem to recover quickly enough, or if the illness is very unusual, the villagers conclude that the disorder is caused by some supernatural agent and must be dealt with by magical means.

The term pansa utai (something passed by) refers to a spirit encounter of which the Iban concerned may not even be consciously aware (Jensen 1974:147). Nevertheless, they might have been ‘struck by a spirit sword’ or ‘wounded by an arrow from the spirits blowpipe’ (Nyuak 1906:168). Or the spirit might have deposited a physical token -- a piece of bone, wood, cloth, hair -- in the person's body (Jensen 1974:147). Using the quartz crystal ‘seeing stone’ ( batu ilau ) and stroking the patient's body with objects from the medicine box, a manang is thought to locate and then remove any troublesome foreign matter. Jensen reports that the manang first bites the blade of a knife for strength (1974:147). In a case Brooke Low describes, the manang called on a spirit familiar to divine the fate of the patient and reveal the location of the intrusive object (Ling Roth 1896:I,267-268). If a spirit itself is causing the problem, the manang may propitiate it with sacrifices, entice it into a wooden figure, try to will it away, bark and growl at it or otherwise frighten it away, and in some cases even attempt to kill it (Brooke Low in Ling Roth 1896:I,266; Jensen 1974:148; Richards 1981:262-263). Just as these forms of attack are directed against spirits who interfere with the physical person ( tuboh ), so they are used to overcome spirits who ensnare a wandering soul ( semengat ). In the latter case, the confrontation occurs among the spirits, as part of the manang 's efforts to retrieve the soul. Thus, ‘occasionally on emerging from his “trance” a shaman will relate his adventures, telling in graphic language of the menacing demons he encountered and how he snatched the lost soul from their grasp, just as they were preparing to devour it’ (Freeman 1967:316).\",\n",

       "  'To a considerable extent marriage removes a woman from her father’s moral authority and places her under that of her husband. Throughout her marriage she is expected to obey, honour, and respect her spouse, and to be particularly scrupulous in this regard in the early years of marriage. Immediately after the wedding her subordination to her husband is emphasised in the traditional beating which her husband administers on the wedding night with a ceremonial whip ( jeedal ). In practice this instrument is rarely seen today, but is said to have been proudly carried by all newly married husbands in the past as a sign of their new marital authority. Today the bride may receive no more than a token cuffing. Other gestures of submission are expected by the husband. His bride should remove his sandals on the wedding night and in the early days of marriage. In contrast to their own exuberance, men even regard the pain which a bride experiences on her first nights of intercourse through the opening and enlargement of the infibulated vulva as a further expression of male virility and female submission. 1 . Men sometimes boas! that their virility is such that they can, unaided, force an opening in the infibulated vulva. Generally, however, the bride’s mother, or if the marriage is celebrated at the husband’s home, his mother, opens the vulva with a small knife. This is said to be something that amother readily does for her daughter as the wishes to make everything ‘smooth’ for the couple. Sometimes, however, the incision is made by a woman of the despised occupational group who, amongst other things, specialise in infibulation. There is no doubt that in the early weeks of a first marriage most women experience much pain. In addition, the forced removal of a bride to her marriage hut by her husband’s friends, which is reported to take place in some weddings, although I have not witnessed it, can be seen to emphasise the dominant role of the man and the subservient, even captive, status of the woman. 2 . Cerulli who reports this amongst the Majeerteen argues from it to a former state of marriage by capture (Cerulli, 1919, p. 73). But as far as I know, there is no sound evidence to suggest that marriage by capture was ever a general process in northern Somaliland.',\n",

This is a broad hint that in Aymara medicine one of the major functions of trephining may have been to relieve compression fractures of the skull caused by these weapons. In defence against them the natives had a light shield, called “kherari” according to von Tschudi, which protected most of the body.

On three points all were agreed: that these female deities were invoked very generally--‘they are in all lineages’; that they were essentially a pair, with balanced titles; and that their powers were great, tending towards illness and destruction. As a mythic corollary, they were usually identified as the sisters of the Atua i te Uruao, and one of them (opinion varied as to which) was the wife of Pu Taufiti, usually said to be Rata (cf. op. cit ., p. 90).

During his residence there, many children were born to him such as Gogombe, Kiyimba, Wampamba and many others. On leaving the capital of Bunwa, he built another one at Manja, after which he lived at Nsaggu for a long time. When he left Nsaggu, he built another capital at Mpumudde, and lived there again for a long time. After Mpumudde, he lived at Kisubi. While he was there, his full brother Lutimba went to fight him. When he learnt of Lutimba’s approach, Kiggala himself fled to Kigungu in Entebbe and stayed there. A few days afterwards, Kasongovu, the prime minister, brought a doctor to the king, and gave him a fetish called Simuwune . Having received the fetish, the king told Kasongovu to “plant” it on Wassozi hill. After it had been planted, Kasongovu returned to Kigungu and reported to the king that he had carried out the task. Hearing that his fetish had been planted, the king left Kigungu and came to Kisubi to fight. He appointed his sons, Gogombe, Kiyimba and Wampamba to attack Lutimba. As soon as they set off, they met Lutimba on the way and fought him. The honours being even on that day, they resumed on the next, but again the battle ended in a stalemate. But during the night of the third day, Lutimba’s army had diarrhoea and also were very badly bitten by red ants. Hence some spent a sleepless night by the fire, while others suffered terribly from diarrhoea. When fighting resumed on the morrow, Kiggala’s sons defeated Lutimba and he fled. When he reached Wassozi village, he spent the night there because that was where he had food to eat. For three days since fighting had begun, Lutimba and his armies had not eaten any food.

If she answers, she will go mad. Do you understand?’ She said she understood. The next day she returned to him and he gave her the medicine. He said ‘It is not my responsibility’. She said ‘I will find her’. She returned home and called her co-wife. Silence. Then she began to dance in the open space of the compound, then madness seized her. The co-wife’s father was a malam also, and he had told her ‘Don’t take anything she gives you, don’t reply if she calls you’. When she heard the other wife calling her name she remained quite quiet. When the jealous wife went mad she went off into the bush. That is a tale of long ago; they still do that sort of thing, but not in the same way as they did in the past; nowadays women get charms, but only to drive out their co-wives.

Moreover, no man may sleep face downwards there 1 [in the sheds of the sacred canoes -- Analyst] a position which is quite allowable in a house. The reason for these observances is to be found in the belief that female deities sometimes desire to have connection with mortal men, end in this event the man sickens and may die. Positions such as the above are suggestive, and might be construed as invitations to the goddess; hence they are to be avoided. The general principle obtains in Tikopia religion that male atua are peculiarly dangerous to mortal women, and female atua to mortal men on account of this sexual bias.

       "  \"Another example of spirit medium behaviour in the domestic field was the consultation of the medium Pa Nukufuti by a member of the chiefly lineage of Taumako, Pa Nukutapu. He was concerned about the health of his wife and children, which he related to his possession of a ritual adze powered by a god of malignant temper whose representation was the reef eel. 3 See Tikopia Ritual and Belief , 1967, pp. 222-5. The woman had had dreams in which she was threatened by the eel, and Pa Nukutapu was anxious to know what the reason was, and if he was responsible. He came to the medium's dwelling one afternoon, having been summoned there by a ‘spirit’ message. I had previously been having a long seance with the medium, who in trance state awaited his visitor. When Pa Nukutapu unexpectedly saw me there he greeted me with surprise, then put on a comic act. He sat up very straight, locked his hands, rattled on the mat, assumed a fierce expression, then relaxed and said, laughing: ‘The Atua i Kafika has come!’ This imitation was treated as a mild joke by those present, including the medium in his trance state, but we then turned to serious things. After some general conversation the medium as spirit leaned forward and said to his visitor: ‘I summoned you, brother, to tell you something’. Then he referred to the adze and accused Pa Nukutapu of having used it improperly, by calling on the god without referring the matter to the control of his chief. Pa Nukutapu listened very seriously but denied that he had acted without due care. He said: ‘Oh! I have not called upon the name of the Atua’. But the medium repeated several times: ‘I am only just telling you; I have sympathy for you; I am saying this to you, brother, because you asked me....’ With the repeated denials of Pa Nukutapu the theme changed and concentrated on the assertion that the children had interfered with the adze. Pa Nukutapu said: ‘I tell the children not to go near the place where I sit, but they won't listen’. Further admonition by the medium in trance state followed, with Pa Nukutapu listening very respectfully. The talk was laconic and allusive to earlier discussion between them, and I did not understand it all, as I listened without interruption; but the medium was clearly searching for a way to identify an explanation which Pa Nukutapu would accept as fitting the facts as he knew them. Then Pa Nukutapu said apologetically, referring to his failure to bring a food gift because of the famine, ‘there's nothing to make it with--you know’. But he extracted from his belt in a fumbling way a short stick of tobacco, which the medium accepted with good grace as recompense for the consultation. It seemed to me that the diagnosis had been rather inconclusive, and had been precautionary rather than explanatory, but it seemed to have given satisfaction. It illustrated an important role of the spirit medium--to act as a recipient of confidences and complaints, to suggest alternative explanations, and to give some advice about conduct and reassurance about the future. This role came to a peak in cases of actual illness.\",\n",
       "  'The common traits of the three types of therapeutic form would seem to be that they all make use of secrecy and obscurity and have connections with the “abnormal” and unknown. Such similarities may be one of the reasons why “traditional” healers show willingness to acquire Western medical knowledge (Tresalti 1984). In some parts of Africa this has proceeded to an extent which now makes it possible to speak of a “professionalisation of African medicine” (Bernardi 1984; Last & Chavunduka 1986). To some extent this is also related to the ways in which experts build up their status. Their function as mediators between the known and the unknown, the safe and the uncertain, implies that healers of any kind gain a particular prestige. As Duerr puts it: “knowledge awaits the one who returns from the wilderness” (1985:74). Exploiting this knowledge - for good or for bad (Jackson 1987c) - is what therapy is about.',\n",

These amulets were valued so highly by the people that, when the disease was healed, the medicine was not cast aside, but decorated and worn as an ornament, and was thus ready, should there be any return of the old symptoms. As charms they were used chiefly for the prevention of disease; their medicinal properties had brought them into notoriety, and they were afterwards regarded as possessing powers to avert the evil which they had originally been meant to cure. One amulet partook of the nature of a fetich, it was called Luzalo, and was designed to insure fecundity. It consisted of a piece of wood, often sewn into a small cat-skin bag, at times decorated with cowry-shells, and worn tied round the waist, so that the amulet rested in front of the wearer. Other amulets having the same purpose were small packets of powdered herbs, which were worn by the woman round her waist; some of the powder would be mixed with water, and drunk from time to time.

All during this time young men would go out very early in the morning with their bow and arrows to act as sentinels, watching particularly for the Sioux, who lurked about to attack women going to and from the fields. Victory Call always took along his bow and arrows should there be a surprise attack. The Skidi fields were located north-west of the villages. Going out early in the morning, one could see the boys picketing about on the high bluff to the west. That morning as they looked up at a big hill west of Genoa, they would also see someone stationed, scouting around for the enemy. The night before Mad Bear and another man had made up their minds to do this. Before dawn they climbed the high bluff west of Beaver Creek and sat down and looked toward where they were roasting corn. “Look at that smoke. Afterward, we can get some corn,” they said. Their legs were hanging over the bluff. There was a little creek that ran from the southwest into Beaver Creek running parallel with the edge of the bluff where the two men were sitting, and a Sioux had been hiding in a trough and watching them. The two men were talking about the cherries on the side of the bluff and the big yellow plums in the bottom and how they would eat them next day. As they were talking, they heard the Sioux making a noise like a crow. Later Mad Bear told his story. “I got frightened and I never thought of my bow and arrows. I was transfixed with fear when I saw all of them. But all at once I got over it. The other man didn’t get over it. We ran down the bluff to the creek. The other man left his bow and arrows there.” Mad Bear continued: “I don’t see why the other fellow left me and ran away to get under the brush. The Sioux caught him. As I ran down the bluff, I felt a shot through my back. It came out of my chest, but I got into the water anyway and they let me go. The other fellow had disappeared.” We looked in the water for him but couldn’t find him. Long after when someone came back to Nebraska, they thought they saw him and he had been scalped and was ashamed to come back. The Pawnees took Mad Bear over the creek and he was doctored by Heavy-Trophies and Herd-of-Horses. As Mad Bear described it, “The doctor put his mouth against mine and blew some water with some medicine in it into my mouth and made me swallow it. I had been sleepy all along, but this woke me up. Then they gave me some medicine to chew and water to drink and I felt better and never worried about it again. I sent the doctors home.” Finally the Pawnees came out and killed a big tall Sioux. His bones remained there a long time afterward. One Sioux was killed and one Pawnee killed or scalped.

       "  'Although wizards and witches alike are believed to abound in the Trobriands, the power of the wizards, according to Malinowski, is \"extremely poor\" when compared to that of the witches. Thus, whereas a wizard can, at best, inflict a lingering disease, which is easily cured by counter magic, there is \"little chance\" of combating the malevolent activities of a witch ( SLS :4,5-46). Witches-called mulukuauso (Malinowski 1955), or mulukwausi (Malinowski [1922] 1961) -- are \"actual living women who may be known and talked with in ordinary life \\'\" but who, in a disembodied form, \"are extremely virulent, powerful, and also ubiquitous. Anyone who chances to be exposed to them is sure to be attacked\" (Malinowski 1955:152-53). Dangerous on land, these \"terrible women\" are even more dangerous on sea, where they destroy shipwrecked sailors (Malinowski [1922] 1961:chapter 10). Although, on land, witches may sometimes cause such ailments as toothaches, swelling of the testicles, tumors, and genital discharge ( SLS :47), more typically they kill and eat their unfortunate victims. Pouncing on them from some hidden -- usually high --place, the invisible witch removes their insides, together with their eyes and tongue, before eating them ( SLS :45). Possessed of \"ghoulish instincts,\" witches not only eat their living victims, but also devour entire corpses, thereby be-coming \"more than ever dangerous to the living\" (Malinowski 1955:153). That is why, following a death, Trobrianders refuse to talk about the village or to enter the surrounding cultivated land.

       "  \"In contrast to Lewis's cross-cultural study, Freeman's own work deals with Iban shamanism in its socio-cultural context. Unlike Sutlive's view of the physician who heals himself, Freeman describes the manang as a ‘healer of the spiritually afflicted’ and sees the practice of shamanism as oriented to the needs of the clients (1975:283). He notes the Iban belief that all humans have separable souls ( semengat ), which may wander abroad and become ensnared by a malevolent spirit. Should this happen ‘the owner will become ill and it is with the recovery of souls and the returning of them to their rightful owners that Iban shamans ( manang ) are principally concerned’ (Freeman 1979:235). In the article ‘Shaman and incubus’, Freeman briefly describes the diagnosis and ritual typically performed by a manang in order to discern the state and whereabouts of the missing soul and to effect its return (1967:316). He then recounts and analyses an instance of a quite different manang performance, in which the shaman slays an incubus spirit. This spirit ( antu buyu ) is thought to seduce Iban women and later to claim the soul of the women's offspring, resulting in miscarriage or the death of a child (1967:317-318). Freeman describes Manang Bungai, the shaman concerned in this instance, as ‘a strongly masculine figure’ in both bearing and personality (1967:320). From the time of his arrival in the longhouse to perform the ritual, he was ‘the imperturbable master of the scene’ (1967:325). Manang Bungai specialized in the slaying of incubi, a formidable task which few shaman were prepared to tackle (1967:319-320). This suggests that the manang role may be interpreted by individual shaman in terms of their own personality and disposition. So Nyala, an aggressively masculine longhouse-headman and renowned head-hunter, confided to Freeman that, if in a dream he were ordered to become a shaman, he would, like Bungai, specialize in the slaying of incubi. ‘But then’, observes Freeman, referring to head-hunting and shamanism, ‘the two pastimes have much in common’ (1967:340).\",\n",

The tail of a wolf is used in the cearar or “left-handed” ceremony with a reverse-twisted llama-wool thread, as an amulet to avoid bad luck. In the north of the Department of La Paz, on the day of his saint, a young Aymara puts on a bead necklace with a olemunaci (a little hand holding a Spanish real ), and if a male a warmimunaci (that he may obtain a wife), or if a female a cacamunaci (that she may obtain a husband); ole means “money,” warmi “woman,” caa “man,” and munaci is derived from munaña , “to love,” that is, such an amulet causes the wearer to be beloved of money, a woman, or a man, as the case may be.

Some informants added a very interesting observation here. They said “Before, there were no illnesses. Illness came with the plants. They brought it with the plants, from the sky.” ), and are always interpreted as punishments and never as a malicious or inimical attack. Any of the personifications of the religion, the Fathers, Mothers, Masters or Heiséi (Death), can send these evils, which then come with the winds, principally with the “blue wind.” For this reason sickness itself is designated as “an ill wind,” a substance like a “seed” which impregnates a person and which, after a brief period of incubation, appears with its symptoms. All illnesses are classified according to the four colors, white, red, black and blue, no matter from what direction it is believed they might have come. Only illnesses of “light colors,” such as white and red, are believed curable; but illnesses which are diagnosed as of “dark color,” that is to say, black or blue, are believed fatal. The Kógi believe that the whites classify illnesses in the same way since they have heard them talk of “yellow fever” and the “red curse” ( 3 . Dysentery. ). Fevers are for them, 274 of course, “red” sicknesses, since they are “hot.” Exhaustion, lack of appetite, lack of strength, thinness, debility, “headache,” are regarded as “black” or “blue” illnesses. In digestive disturbances, which are very frequent, the illness is classified according to the color of the excrement, which is always examined carefully, and perhaps the classification by colors is derived from such examinations. Perhaps the most feared sickness is dysentery ( 1 . Apparently only amoebic dysentery exists. ), since the loss of blood means that “the body is drying up.” In order to produce more blood, the sick person swallows water in great quantities. The Kógi men complain frequently of “headache,” and this same “ache” is often mentioned as the cause of death among adult men. The women do not appear to suffer from this ailment, which leads one to believe that it is associated with the use of coca.',\n",

When there is some unusual or obstinate disease, or when a woman has had miscarriage, the manangs declare that Buyu is the cause of the trouble, and must be killed. A large number of witch-doctors are called together, and the feat is performed in this way: The patient is taken out of the room, and laid on the common veranda, and covered with a net. In the room is placed an offering of food, and the manangs walk in procession up and down the whole length of the house, chanting their incantations, and inviting the evil spirit to come to his victim, and also to partake of the sumptuous repast that is prepared for him. This occupies some time, for the spirit may be far away, on a journey, or fishing, or hunting. All lights are extinguished, and in the darkness the manangs walk up and down the public hall of the Dyak house. At intervals one of them peeps in at the door to see if the spirit has arrived. In due time the demon comes, and then the manangs themselves enter the darkened room. Presently sounds of scuffling, of clashing of weapons, and of shouting are heard by the Dyaks outside. Soon after the door is thrown open, and the demon said to be dead. He was cheated into coming to torment his prey, and instead of a week and helpless victim he met the crafty and mighty manangs, who have done what ordinary mortals cannot do--attacked and killed him. As a proof of the reality of the deed lights are brought in, and the manangs point to spots of blood on the floor, and occasionally to the corpse itself in the shape of a dead monkey or snake, which they say was the form the spirit took for the occasion. The trick is a very simple one. Some time in the day the manangs procure blood from a fowl or some other animal, or it may be from their own bodies, mix it with water in a bamboo to prevent congealing, smuggle it into the room, and scatter it on the floor in the dark. This can safely be done, as no one but the manangs themselves are in the room. Neither lights nor outsiders are admitted, on the plea that under such circumstances the demon could not be enticed to enter. The trick has often been detected and the performers openly accused of imposture; consequently, it is not now practised so often as in former times. When this victory over the spirit is won, the Pelian goes on in the usual way till the morning hours.',\n",

The pain made it impossible for her to sleep, so she was treated by covering the burn with the usual mixture of clay, turtle fat and honey, and exposing it to hot smoke. The smoke was provided by burning the fresh seeds of a creeper, each as big as a horse-chestnut and of the same colour, but of a lenticular shape.

A “daughter of the bori” called Ku'ba had a son, Mak'eri, whose wife, Tinay, had left him. The spirit `Dan Musa, angered at this result to his “mount,” afflicted Tinay's little daughter with stomach trouble. Tinay, therefore, came to Ku'ba and was told to buy the speckled cock requïred by this spirit as a sacrifice. She neglected this advice, whereupon her daughter became more seriously ill with c'oc'a , 31 C'oca' means, literally, “milking” and is therefore a disease appropriate to 'Inna, a Fulani milkmaid. It seems to be a kind of paralysis. caused by `Inna, the mother of `Dan Musa. In giving this account, it was emphasized that Ku'ba herself had not sought to inflict any harm on the girl, but that the bori who were “on her head” took this means of avenging the insult offered to their “mount.” Thereupon, Ku'ba's daughter-in-law came to her again, and was told that a bori performance was necessary, and that she must have a white sheep for `Inna, a black cock for Gajimari, a speckled cock for Duna and a red and white cock for K'ak'ari. These animals were all supplied by Tinay's husband Mak'eri as he was anxious for his wife to return to him and for his child to recover.\",\n",

Then “the world is stricken as with mist,” the eyes blink much less frequently than usual and the person easily becomes tired ( rav'gâluvvä ) -- to such an extent that he will have nose-bleeds and be unable to sleep. He should be given a cold compress (snow inside a piece of cloth) on his eyes and should lie down in the shelter or at home for at least 24 hours. To prevent snow blindness ( t sâlbme-sud'dom ; t sâlmiht suovgâ h tuvveh , I. t salm eh koddojeh ) in early spring, the Lapps remain in a dark stable or look inside through a steaming sheep-barndoor until their eyes begin to fill with tears. If there are no sheep, they will wash their eyes with their own, warm urine, as many as three or four times a day. Other Lapps dye a piece of cotton fabric black and make a cap ( peäi've-suo 'gâ ) which they press down to the nostrils on bright days. The ordinary cap is placed on top of the black one (I. reind.-L.). Snow blindness may also be avoided if the eyes are not washed between February and Midsummer (I. fisher-L.), or if the lower eyelid is covered with soot (E.). The Utsjoki-Lapps used alum water. 1 ANDELIN, Oulun Lehti, 1881, n:o 1. -- A few drops of mother's milk are dripped into a sore eye, after which it is covered with a woolen cloth and blown upon. Another method is to throw cold water in the patient's eyes unexpectedly, e.g. when he opens a door (U.). If the disease of the eyes is due to cold, they should be rubbed with the water obtained by boiling white, black and red stones. 2 ANDELIN, Oulun Lehti, 1881, n:o 1. A kind of cataract ( tsâlmi l anstârduvveh ) may form in the eyes in clear spring weather. When the patient enters a smoky hut, the cataract will break as a result of the flow of tears, and it is licked away (I. reind.-L.). The real cataract ( smäi'ti ) is healed by boiling birchashes in water. When the dregs have settled a pin is dipped into the surface layer (= lye) and one drop is let fall on the cataract. A minute amount of mercury has the same effect (U.). Formerly a louse was placed in the eye; it was believed to wear out the cataract when it moved. 3 Oulun W.-S. 1857, n:o 34. Tobacco-spittle may also be put in an eye afflicted with a cataract. 1 OINONEN, Kolmen valtaku nan ota-Lappia, p. 169. If the eye was injured while looking at a solar eclipse, it was healed by looking into a well or a copper kettle in moonlight, where the reflected image of the moon was shining. 2 PAULAHARJU, Taka-Lappia, p. 164. Some Lapps suffer from night blindness . The Kolt-Lapps believe that this is due to the fact that newborn children are brought at once close to the dazzling hearth. 3 Idem. Kolttain mailta, p. 175. A bit of dirt in the eye is taken away by blinking the eye in lukewarm water. At the worst, some skillful old woman will turn the eyelid inside out ( forgu h tih ) and take away the particle with the tip of her tongue. Some Lapps have tweezers to remove dirt particles; they may also be taken out with a golden ring. The Utsjoki-Lapps aripped mother's milk in the eye.

The manang is expected to effect a cure by identifying the cause and determining the site of the complaint in his batu ilau before removing from the patient's body the physical token deposited by the spirit. The token may be almost anything: a piece of wood or cloth, perhaps translated as a squirrel's hair ( bulu tupai ) or the sting of a bee ( butoh manyi ). The rite itself is simple. The manang bites the blade of a knife for strength; he also puts to his mouth the objects from his box with which he strokes the patient to discover the place of the illness. A mixture of blood from a fowl, turmeric, and spittle is prepared as ointment. The same treatment is used in other straightforward cases or where the cause is believed to be similar: when, for example, a child does not grow normally, or imprecise symptoms are experienced over a period of time.\",\n",

       "  'The same truth is evident in all the Santal’s dealings with things that he cannot understand. The attitudes summed up in the terms “magic” and “religion” are both in evidence. It is not usual in these days to distinguish sharply between them. 3 Cf. G. and M. Wilson, The Analysis of Social Change, Cambridge University Press, 1945, p. 72: “Magic for us, though it may not postulate any transcendent reality, is an integral part of primitive religion.” Magic is used by the Santal as a tool to accomplish many and varied ends. It is not absent from his dealings with the spirits, and it can be used for social as well as antisocial ends. It does consequently overlap the sphere of “religion”, which, however, covers experiences where the arts of magic do not reach, while magic also works independently in some situations. For the most part, the various approaches to the problems of living are simultaneously pursued, by individuals as well as by society. “Charms” are in almost universal use as a precaution against sickness; one finds the shell of a land tortoise hung in the cowshed to ward off smallpox, or cowrie shells worn as a protection against the evil eye, and amulets worn round the arm as a matter of routine and called ran, or medicine. A double attitude is most apparent in efforts to control the weather that plays so great a rôle in their life. In a period of great drought the Santals probably arrange for a special festival to be held, with sacrifices offered to the “Five”. At the same time they busy themselves in other ways which are quite independent of the sacrifice. Unmarried girls plaster the dancing floor with cowdung, while the married women do the same to their own courtyards. An investigation is made as to whether any woman has tied a rope on any roof. It is taboo for women to climb on roofs in the ordinary way, but some of the cowsheds and outbuildings have low roofs on which it would be possible to tie the straw to a rafter without climbing up. If it transpires that any woman has done so, she is made to climb up on to the roof and undo her work, first removing her clothing. Other investigations are made too. It may be that someone has stored dried matkom on the floor in her house instead of placing it on a plank or on stones; or it may be that oil has been stored in a sealed pot, in which case the covering must be removed. Underlying all these activities is the conviction that the welfare of society and of the individual depends on establishing a balance between man, nature and the spirit world, and they witness to a faith that such a balance is possible of achievement.',\n",

In this case, the spirits directly concerned were a grandmother, whose grave was not kept clean, and a sister of the girl’s mother, whose heir had not received her share of the beer brought for her betrothal.

Often in the shape of a tapir he allows himself to be pursued by the hunters and even to be killed. Then he resumes his normal form and eats of the slain tapir.

       "  'The fibre of the Hibiscus is used mainly in the hunting of turtle and big fish. Consequently the tree itself from which the fibre is obtained is believed to possess the power of warding off all dangers connected with turtle and the sea. There is a custom that turtle flesh may only be cooked with wood of the Hibiscus , otherwise it will be uneatable. In the turtle-eating ceremony the initiate who, as we shall see later, is in a condition of danger by reason of having eaten turtle for the first time after a period of abstention, is seated on Hibiscus leaves and holds a bundle of the same leaves before him. At the same ceremony the leaves of this tree are used in the dance, and the initiate is given a skewer made from its wood with which to feed himself. If for any reason the leaves of the Hibiscus are not obtainable when the ceremony is performed those of the Myristica longifolia are used instead. Now this is the tree from which the natives always make their canoe paddles, which, like ropes of Hibiscus fibre, are used in hunting turtle. This specialisation is therefore easy to understand; the natives habitually make use of the Hibiscus and the Myristica in turtle-hunting; they use the intrinsic qualities of these trees in their actual struggles with turtle and large fish, and by means of these qualities they are able to succeed in overcoming their prey; they therefore come to believe that these trees possess special powers which not only enable them to conquer the turtle itself but also are able to protect them from the evil influences that they believe (for reasons to be explained later) result from the eating of its flesh.',\n",

Naturally, many points mentioned under previous heads may be considered as bearing upon this topic. On approaching the tipi of a stranger, it is proper for a man to pause some distance away and call out to know if the head of the family is at home. If he is out and there is no adult male to act instead, the visitor is upon such information not expected to enter but may, of course, carry on a conversation with the women on the outside. When one is acquainted, or where the man is known to be within, he enters without ceremony and takes a place to his right of the door. Should the entire side be unoccupied he moves up to a place opposite the host; should it be occupied he takes the first vacant place. However, a man’s status and age may make it incumbent upon those seated to make a place appropriate to his rank. 1 1 The ownership of certain medicines may determine the seat. Thus, as guests, the medicine pipe men are given a seat opposite the host and must give way to no one. Should they go out for an interval, no one should occupy the seat. As the penalty will be disease, we have here what may be considered a taboo. The fire is the dividing point of the house: hence, to pass between a guest and the fire is very impolite. Should a man of some importance be smoking, one must not pass between him and the fire, he may, however, take the pipe in his hands and pass between it and the smoker. As soon as a male guest enters, the host begins to cut tobacco and fill a pipe, which when lighted is passed to the guest, back to the host etc., until it has burned out.

       "  \"To the Layar-Skrang Iban the ayu is a ‘life’ which cannot be seen even by manang , though like the bungai , it is cared for by mythical shaman. Represented by a young plant placed in a jar in the bilek apartment, the ayu may be tended by a manang , then planted and fenced until it is well established. This rite is carried out for the ayu of children only; it is enacted if a child's growth or constitution is weak or if the child faces danger of contamination through another person's death (Uchibori 1978:25-26). The description of this protective rite for an endangered child recalls the pelian bejereki rite discussed earlier (Sandin 1978). In that instance, the sabang ayu was placed in the public gallery rather than the bilek , but it was subsequently planted outside as a visible symbol of the child's vitality and longevity. The use of a sabang cordyline plant in the pelian bejereki is consistent with the concern to establish a ‘ladder of the gods’ at the same time, while the rush or bamboo used by the Layar-Skrang Iban is consistent with their concern to evoke a cool/wet environment and, by analogy, ‘coolness/health’ in the socio-spatial setting of the bilek and longhouse group (Uchibori 1978:32). Despite such minor variations on the theme of health and security, I take the pelian bejereki rite (the report of which comes from the Rimbas, like the Layar a tributary of the (Saribas) as indicative of a similar concept and practice in relation to ayu throughout the Saribas-Skrang region.\",\n",

The Indians showed with apparent satisfaction even those cicatrices which the palometa fishes had inflicted on their body with their sharp teeth when they were bathing in the river. It is clear that according to the idea of the Indians not only the bleeding purges the body from impure matter and strengthens the limbs, but that the very scars which remain after the operation possess some mysterious power to keep off evil influences, a power which is much the same as that ascribed to real tattooing marks. This Indian view is especially conspicuous in regard to an operation which the whites sometimes perform upon Indians who have come in contact with European civilization, namely, vaccination. I could myself appreciate the extraordinary importance ascribed to scars when during my stay at Esperanza I vaccinated a number of Chaco Indians who were employed as labourers at the sugar factory. The Christians probably have no remedy which the natives understand so well as this one, and they therefore as a rule submitted to the vaccine inoculation without remonstration, in fact, with pleasure.

       "  \"To the Iban, then, the domain in which human beings live and the realm in which spirits ( antu ) roam are spatially coextensive although perceptually distinct: it is a different way of seeing which characterizes the spiritual vision of the world. Furthermore, as Freeman points out, ‘the Iban world view recognizes no firm boundary between phantasy and reality, between the imagined realm in which demons roam and the natural world of everyday experience’ (1967:317). It is in the context of this shared domain that the Iban seek to establish, by ritual means, barriers of limited provenance and application so as to separate or conceal particular elements of this multi-faceted environment, as and when they deem it necessary to do so. In this way, precautions may be taken against threatening antu , as well as against hazardous exposure to the dead. I have already discussed the shielding rites ( bedinding , literally, to make a protective wall) in which a shaman uses textiles to enclose an Iban woman threatened by an incubus, or applies a talisman ( engkerabun ) to make an Iban invisible to evil spirits and so cure him/her of bad dreams. Similarly, Heppell reports that after an ordeal by diving ‘all the supporters of the winning principal receive a payment ( lantan ) which is made to create a barrier across which any curses made by the loser cannot pass’ (1975:332 ch.9 n.1). The payment is thought to strengthen the souls of the victor's supporters, making them immune from the consequences of the loser's curse. Again, men leaving a graveyard after a burial perform acts intended as ‘the putting of a barrier between the world of the living and the Land of the Dead. For the border between the two realms has been dangerously opened by the digging of the grave’ (Uchibori 1978:68). Finally, when the troop of the dead come to collect the newly deceased, they find themselves unable to enter the longhouse, since ‘the entrance is blocked by a mythical shaman with ceremonial fabrics which have fearful designs of crocodiles and tigers’ (Uchibori 1978:184). When no such measures are taken, the border between the world of the living and that of the dead is said to be ‘[n]o thicker than the skin of the brinjil fruit’ (Freeman 1970:39) and as penetrable as ‘the inner skin of a lemayong fruit’ (Uchibori 1978:219). Likewise, a ritual chant describes the door of the sky as ‘thinner than the skin of a banana plant’ and ‘thinner than the skin of the fruit of an eggplant’ (Masing 1981:243). Nevertheless, this same door of the sky is simultaneously depicted, in the chant, as ‘a formidable door’ which only Lang Singalang Burong is powerful enough to break through (1981:243). Thus, even normally fragile borders may be metaphorically exploited as the means to represent superior skills.\",\n",
       "  \"“For the forerunners of death, accidents and sickness, the Eskimo knows of only one cause, the malignant activities of evil spirits or of the shades of the dead. Many of Higilak's seances in Victoria island were held for the purpose of propitiating or intimidating these shades and dispelling their influence. The natives have no knowledge whatever of medicine, and very little of surgery. A head-ache is sometimes cured by bleeding, broken limbs are set in splints and frozen members are amputated. Aksiatak, for example, disloc ated his ankle while wrestling in the dance-house; he pulled it back into place, covered it with a long deerskin sock and laid three splints around it, one on each side and one at the back, keeping them firmly in place by means of a raw-hide lashing; a second cord running from his hand to the sole of his foot enabled him to raise his leg without bending it. A year later his son Nakitok fell from the roof and broke his thigh; the Eskimos set his leg in splints also. Both accidents were ascribed to the machinations of evil spirits and the shamans were asked to appease them. A painful swelling on the arm of the old shaman Ilatsiak was cured by lancing. For snow-blind-ness the natives use counter-irritants, flooding the eyes with the smoke of burning heather or of the Dryas integrifolia, or tying a louse to a thread and letting it scratch the sclerotis. Complaints that are considered magical in their origin, however, find their surest remedies in counter-magic, so a shaman is usually called in at once to diagnose the cause and prescribe a cure.

Her food at two or three rupees per month ‘because she was ill and could not work’. 2. Cloth - if the girl was ill for a long time and a new cloth became necessary. 3. Medical treatment including the cost of roots and powders (if purchased), the ojha’s fee and the value of the sacrificial animals. * The ojhas fees are normally five four anna bits in minor cases and five rupees in major. Further fees, however, may be settled by private negotiation and the number of sacrificial animals also varies with the illness and the ojha. At the time of visiting parents-in-law for taking a wife back after illness, an account is struck and the husband must then meet it.

In other words, it is not the pagar api that is used for this purpose. Furthermore, Uchibori's explanation is specific to the Layar-Skrang concept of the bungai as a plant growing at the foot of the fireplace post.

Yet the pagar api is so named and common to manang rites in the Baleh as well as the Layar-Skrang.

Thus, although less violent, the illnesses the balubaale produce are more difficult to cure and consequently many say that they are the most dangerous (Note 28 Note — It must be emphasised that ideas of causation are vague and it is impossible to draw up an ordered system.

He was created by the all-mother Mameumán and was set in the sky by Sintana, who also shows himself superior to him on earth (cf. p. 98). Therefore he is obliged to serve mankind, and one can influence him. The most natural thing that one wants from him is dryness for clearing the fields, and furthermore that the heat will not be too great, in the wider sense rain. He in fact accomplishes all this, induced to do so by the masks representing him or related to him. But he is also capable of other services, since still other things belong to him and start from him. Through his course in the sky he can see to it that the sicknesses do not approach from the four cardinal points and that the directions, that is, the world, do not collapse. Sicknesses particularly, which can be summed up in the term fever-heat, are directly from the nature of the sun’s heat. Therefore they are also called mulbatá, from the stem mul, mun (white, gleaming, hot) ( 1 .

The Chukchee regard it as indigenous, though its name.... ‘Chuvantzy....substance’....Suggests the tribe who in earlier times were mediators between the Russians and the Chukchee, and probably, after obtaining the disease from the Russians, introduced it among the Chukchee. However this may be, one afflicted with syphilis was regarded as unclean. At home he was provided with bedding of his own, with a separate dish and bowl, and was kept aloof, lest others should contract the disease. A family having several syphilitics among its older members was considered as ‘subject to shunning’....Their fire especially was regarded as tainted. They were not allowed admission into clean camps, lest the odor of their hearth and the shadow of their entrance might prove infectious to their neighbors. Nowadays syphilis has evidently decreased; but elderly men and women with deformed noses and ugly scars on their foreheads, showing the third stage of the disease, are frequently met with everywhere. Even now these are considered unclean, though the precautions against them are not observed. The outbreaks of syphilis which occasionally occur among the younger people are considered simply as a different sort of disease, milder and less contagious.”',\n",
       "  'Parents of a child who is prone to illness but not really kui mia: often approach a woman who has successfully reared several healthy children and ask her to take their daughter as a “dry daughter.” After a minor ritual and the exchange of gifts, the “dry mother” and her new daughter assume a mock parent-child relationship. In effect this amounts to little more than the “dry mother” including the child in family events like marriages, birthday celebrations, and feasts during religious festivals, and the child giving her “dry mother” little gifts and paying her visits. In some cases as the child grows older she outgrows the relationship and has little more to do with her “dry mother” than she does with other women. Often, however, a warm bond of affection develops between the “dry mother” and her charge, and the tie that was merely formal becomes real, lasting until death. In asking about the “dry mother” relationship in Peihotien, we discovered that it was not always initiated by the parents of an ailing child. Sometimes a woman who has a favorite among the children of a friend asks to be made her “dry mother.” One woman in Peihotien who had the misfortune to never bear children of her own had at least two “dry daughters” that we knew of; now adults, they were still frequent visitors to her home. We also found several cases in which older women who had become particularly fond of village teen-agers (and in one case of a young bride) formalized their relationships by referring to themselves and their favorites as “dry mother” and “dry daughter.”',\n",

The mother then goes and sits on a chair near the fire and is handed the baby to hold in her arms. She spreads her legs facing the fire to hasten the expulsion of the afterbirth. When this occurs a thread is used to tie the cord close to the baby's stomach. Then the measure of the distance between an outstretched thumb and the middle finger (a hoht ) is applied to the umbilical cord that has been tied. The cord is then cut at this distance, about six inches, from the thread. If the cord is cut short, then when the baby grows up it won't be able to shout very loud, an ability that is important for shouting communications across valleys, on the trail, and between houses. The afterbirth and what remains of the cord are put in the ashes next to the flames of the roaring fire and having dried a little are burnt. If it were not burnt up then the child would be subject to stomach aches throughout its life.\",\n",

It may be covered at first by the same ‘attitude’ block common to most therapy in human history: a link to natural effects (natural recovery indicates success of therapy). If the patient worsens or dies, i.e. if one moves from ‘low’ to ‘high’ intensity, then the ‘structural’ block comes into play. But this does not account for symptomatic treatment with specifics, for in the 1890s, whilst Jalla was of the opinion that physiological knowledge was rudimentary, there being no concept of the function of organs, the circulation of the blood, etc., he also noted the presence of effective purgatives and emetics. 67 Jalla, Notes privées , p. 127.

       "  \"Although neither the gods nor the ancestors are conceived of as essentially malevolent, both are considered capable of inflicting misfortunes on the living. These misfortunes are always interpreted as punishment, but very different motives explain the penalties attributed to the gods and those attributed to the ancestors. Like their counterparts in the human bureaucracy, the gods are thought of as proud and exceedingly jealous of their prerogatives. Any derogation of their high status is likely to bring a quick and angry response. A few years ago a man in Hsia-ch'i-chou fell at a fire-walking and was so badly burned that he later died of his wounds. Some of his neighbors now say that the god was punishing him for having failed to observe three days of sexual abstinence prior to the event. “The god was angry because that man came there dirty.” Another man in the same village suffers from severe palsy, which people say is a consequence of his having made fun of a god he saw at a procession when he was a child. That this view of the gods was widespread in traditional China is suggested by Mrs. William L. Pruen's comments on the death of one of her neighbor's children in Chengtu: “At another home in this compound a little fellow, about eleven years of age, was suddenly taken dangerously ill. The poor boy was very worried because he had in some way insulted an idol shrine and thought he was being punished for his fault. He died the next day.” (Pruen 1906: 101–2.)\",\n",
       "  'This completes the analysis of demographic structure and culture. The previous chapter has shown how fertility with a balanced sex ratio at birth and free or captive female in-migration for marriage changed the age-sex distribution of the Mucajai group, especially by reducing the imbalanced sex ratio of the reproductive population. This chapter has shown how a changed age-sex structure has, in turn, changed the intensity of two cultural patterns. There was an increase in monogamous marriages and a corresponding decrease in polyandrous marriages. Where wife-sharing was retained, there was a diminution of the number of males in the sharing networks. The change in the Table 9.5 Schematic of Principal Demographic and Cultural Changes age--sex distribution also diminished the age difference between marital partners. This, in turn, increased the age differences between mothers-in-law and sons-in-law, thereby reducing potential sexual conflict within family groups. As a result the avoidance patterns between mothers-in-laws and sons-in-laws have diminished. Table 9.5 gives a synoptic view of these changes. In brief, the synthetic section has shown how culture affects the demographic structure of a population (Chapter 8), and how this, in turn, affects the intensity of some cultural patterns (Chapter 9).',\n",

Quarrels are continually going on between neighbors on account of mutual accusations. Several of the people that I knew were given new derisive names on account of their thieving exploits.

Another was called ‘Neck-laced Latuwge....because while on a visit to another camp he stole some half-cooked entrails that were boiling in the kettle, wound them around his neck, and, when pursued, continued to eat from one end thereof.

       "  \"The way the Andamanese think about the spirits is shown in the Akar-Bale legend of the origin of death. 1 Page 216. Yaramurud , having died through an accident, self-caused, becomes a spirit, but he does so only under the compulsion exercised upon him by his mother, who, now that he is dead, insists that he must go away from the world of the living and become a spirit. The spirit then comes back to see his brother and by this contact causes the brother's death. The story implies that it was not because Yaramurud was evilly disposed towards his brother that he killed him, but on the contrary it was his attachment to his relative that caused him to return to visit him, and death followed as a result of this contact of the living man with the spirit. Since that time deaths have continued to occur in the same way. Thus it appears that the Andamanese conceive that the spirits do not cause death and sickness through evil intention, but through their mere proximity, and, as the legend very clearly shows, the burial customs are intended to cut off the unwilling spirit from contact with the living. This explains also why during the period of mourning the relatives of a dead person are thought to be in danger of sickness, and have more to fear from the spirit than others, for since it is they who were most attached to him during life it is they who are most likely to suffer from contact with him after he is dead. It was Yaramurnd's brother who was the first to die through the influence of the spirits.\",\n",

       "  'The third case was the most dramatic of all. In 1929 a son of the Ariki Tafua fell ill and the chief became very disturbed about this. He had been baptized as a Christian, but this had not meant that he had abandoned all belief in the reality of his traditional gods and spirits. He regarded the illness of his son as due to the action of some malicious spirits, and seeing his son get weaker and imagining that he would die he attempted suicide by hanging (p. 138). This was a despairing act given the rationalization of shaming his traditional gods for not looking after his family. When his suicide attempt had been prevented (and it was never quite clear how far the chief had hoped it would be prevented) he addressed his gods, reproaching them for wanting to take the life of a young man while he himself, an old man, still remained. According to Tikopia belief, in response to this reproach the gods allowed his son to recover, but made the chief himself ill. From this illness he was in turn in Tikopia eyes saved by the effort of his peers, the Ariki Kafika and Ariki Taumako, both pagan chiefs, who visited him and laid hands on him. In the course of the rites which accompanied these proceedings the Ariki Tafua, who was a spirit medium, twice entered the trance state, and in spirit form gave utterance to reassuring statements. But the day before he became ill he had also had a trance and in spirit form spoke to the assembled company, saying ‘Who is the man who told the chief that he should hang himself?’ The spirit appeared to be very angry. His eldest son and another senior man crawled across the floor of the house to him, and pressed their noses one to each of his knees in token of obeisance. Then they and all the others present in the house assured the spirit that he was mistaken, that it had been the idea of the chief himself alone that he should commit suicide, that no one else had advised him to do so. At last the spirit appeared to be appeased and the trance ended.',\n",

A [See Cat. 121, pp. 191-192 -- Analyst] Does his conclusion--that misfortune will be laid to the hostile acts of ancestors--also hold in this instance? As we have seen, Freedman characterizes the behavior expected of Chinese ancestors as “essentially benign.” But it is my impression that ancestors in Ch'inan are much more active and interfering than this. Unfortunately, I am unable to say to the exact percentage point how many misfortunes are attributed to the ancestors, for I have no record of the advice people received on their frequent trips to consult professionals in Sanhsia or Panch'iao (near Taipei). In the village itself, I attended almost every session at which a shaman attempted to determine the cause of some ill. Six of them were prolonged sessions, some lasting over several days, and involved cases of serious or intractable illness. Two of these cases were diagnosed as instances of ancestral interference; one was held to be the work of an ancestor in the hall, the other the work of an ancestor in the grave. But the frequency with which ancestors are blamed for misfortune is surely much higher than this suggests, because many out-of-town shamans tend to blame misfortune on the ancestors, and geomancers, who are resorted to very often, inevitably relate their interpretations to the personal activities of ancestors.\",\n",

       "  \"Disease, health, or death are also the result of magic or counter-magic. The Trobrianders have a very complex and very definite set of theoretical views on these matters. Good health is primarily of course the natural, normal state. Minor ills may be contracted by exposure, over-eating, over-strain, bad food, or other ordinary causes. Such ailments never last, and have never any really bad effects, nor are they of immediate danger. But, if a man sickens for any length of time, and his strength seems to be really sapped, then the evil forces are at work. By far the most prevalent form of black magic, is that of the bwaga'u , that is the black sorcerer, of whom there are a number in each district. Usually even in each village there are one or two men more or less dreaded as bwaga'u . To be one does not require any special initiation except the knowledge of the spells. To learn these--that is, to learn them in such a manner as to become an acknowledged bwaga'u --can only be done by means of high payment, or in exceptional circumstances. Thus, a father will often “give” his sorcery to his son, always, however, without payment; or a commoner will teach it to a man of rank, or a man to his sister's son. In these two latter cases a very high payment would have to be given. It is important as a characteristic of the kinship conditions of this people, that a man receives sorcery gratis from his father, who according to the traditional kinship system is no blood-relation, whereas he has to pay for it to his maternal uncle, whose natural heir be is.\",\n",

These malignant beings have a permanent abode in the south. Occasionally they will move to the Trobriand Archipelago, and, invisible to ordinary human beings, they walk at night through the villages rattling their lime-gourds and clanking their wooden sword clubs.

Leria , epidemic disease, obtains then in the villages. The malignant spirits can sometimes change into reptiles and then become visible to human eyes.

       "  'Comparison of the pre-Islamic Somali spirit-world with Muslim angelology and demonology reveals again the much higher degree of systematization in the latter. In Muslim theology, angels, pre-eminent amongst whom is Gabriel, generally figure as Divine Messengers created by God to serve and worship Him. They are charged with recording man’s actions in this life, receiving his soul in heaven, and acting as his counsel on the day of judgment. On the other hand, jinn are those rebellious spirits created similarly to man, but of fire in place of earth, and committed to Solomon’s keeping, who seek to lead man astray and to subvert the teachings of the prophets. It is as jinn that the majority of pre-Islamic spirits previously associated with Waaq are assimilated in Islam. This is illustrated in the following tale current among the Gasar Gudda tribe of Somalia. ‘Solomon, son of David, on whom be peace, commanded all men, all the animals, the wind, spirits, and demons, the entire kingdom of the Great King. One day the jinn were at work as usual, and Solomon, leaning against a tree, seemed to be watching them although he gave no sign of repose. Solomon was dead, but remained supported by the tree while the jinn unaware of what had happened went on with their work. At last the termites succeeded in eating their way through Solomon’s support precipitating him heavily on to the ground. The jinn quickly ran to the spot and saw that the son of David was dead. They began to rejoice for now they could stop working since their master was dead. They hastened to the termites and made a pact with them, saying, “You make your nest of earth and we will bring the water for its strengthening”. From this time forth jinn and termites are in alliance’ (Ferrandi, 1903, p. 309). Here within Islam the spirits attendant upon the mysterious construction of termite mounds are associated with jinn in Solomon’s keeping. The relation ‘spirits—termites’ is given Muslim sanction in Solomon’s authority over jinn . Similarly the source of the efficacy of divination, ordeals, charms, and prophylactic amulets has been transferred from Waaq to Allah when beneficent and to jinn when mischievous or evil. Now the favourite amulet is the Sufi rosary ( tusbah ) whose 99 beads remind the believer of the innumerable praise-names of Allah and help him to perform his prayer-tasks. Perhaps equally popular as amulets are small leather pouches armed with inscriptions from the Koran. Thus phenomena which formerly owed their power to some connexion with Waaq now originate in Allah, the ultimate source of all power. 1 cf. the fate of the pre-Islamic Gods and spirits in Arabia, Koran, Sura XXXVII. For general indications of the universality of such syncretisms in Islam, see Gibb, 1947, 23 ff.; Miliot, 1949, 643. Saar spirits are described by Somali as a kind of jinn . The whole spirit hierarchy of Waaq is being progressively Islamized. This is a process which naturally also applies to God’s attributes. Among the Gasar Gudda, again, the rainbow, from being the Sky God’s belt, has become the path good souls take to heaven, although it is also contended by some to be the smoke made by rain falling upon termite hills. Rain-drops are believed to turn into angels (an understandable evaluation); thunder ( uri ) is the voice of angels ( malaika ) or the noise of their combat in striving to stop rain. Lightning ( birk ) darts forth from the armpits of melek Mikail, the archangel Michael. 1 Ferrandi, 1903, 298 ff. Michael ( Sura, II) appears thus to be taken as a symbol of war. These are a few examples indicative of the way in which the Muslim spirit hierarchy is understood in terms of Cushitic cosmology.',\n",
       "  'In the towns one finds Arabs who fill the office of muéddsin [Ed., muezzin ?] and qudhât . Special priests (wodadín) roam through the countryside, usually traveling through a region with a number of other priests, performing the functions of their office and lining their pockets in the process. They have no influence whatever on the people. Superstition flourishes in the most luxuriant forms, but I would say that even this has no significance whatever, because the natives content themselves entirely with copied amulets and the like. Belief in sorceresses ( komâju, sorceress) is to be encountered here and there since, after all, every old woman is surrounded by the aura of being able to perform sorcery. The Somâli swears an oath (dâr) on the Koran, and the Ogadên on the head of his children and wives. Breach of promise with respect to the Whites or the enemy, however, is no crime. The prayer times are those of all Islamites (9:30, súbbeh; noon, dóhur; 3:30, ássur; 6:30, mágrib; and eight o’clock, asâ ); they are observed only by the most pious. Attempts to convert the Somâl to the Christian religion have never been seriously undertaken. In Zeila, to be sure, a magnificent house has been built for the French Mission, but not in the hope of being able to win the Somâl for Christendom. The building is supposed to serve merely as a way station for missionaries going off to Galla country. The universal complaint is that the Somâli curtly turns away the European apostle of the faith and that, in view of the people’s nomadic way of life, the latter is unable to step in to civilize the natives by getting them in the habit of working regularly. None of the religious ideas of the Galla has been incorporated by the Somâl. Except to celebrate Ramadan there are no festive periods. I heard nothing about divine judgments among the western Somâl tribes. The times of year are mostly distinguished according to the rainy seasons in the manner already indicated, but between these there are also shorter periods ( bil, month) by which time is occasionally reckoned. Their names are not generally known ( 73 . The names of the months given by Haggenmacher, op. cit., p. 28, are not all known to the Ejssa, so I must assume that they are perhaps valid for only a small group of coastal inhabitants. The Êjssa and Hábr Auál use the following designations for the months: dúggo (November), bil dúrroh hôra (December), bil dúrroh dámba (January), rajâl hôra (February), rajâl dáha (March), rajâl dámba (April), sáboh (May), wa báris (June), sunkât (July), sunfûr (August), sid atâl (September), aráfo (October). ).',\n",

Illness of this kind represents a supernatural sanction that punishes improper behavior and therefore is an important instrument of social control. In some cases the cure for the problem is accomplished through confession and public acknowledgment of the transgression. For example, the i soro (a ritual of reconciliation and apology) requires openly expressed contrition (Arno 1976; Koch et al. 1977). Also, one informant told me that when a person is suffering a long, painful, and lingering death, that too may be in punishment for secret misdeeds, and after it becomes apparent what is happening, a relative will go to the person and ask if he or she has anything to tell. If he or she confesses, a peaceful death ensues.',\n",

Kaggwa says that in Busiro the Twins were cared for as though they were “the living kings themselves” ([1907] 1934: 129). Today, attendants at the royal shrines refer to the Twin as the “Kabaka.” They also refer to the base (containing the umbilical-cord stump) as the Twin’s “stomach” and to the loop handle as its “arms.” When the Twin is wrapped in barkcloth, they say that it is “dressed.” Like a human twin, the royal Twin is also wrapped in bbombo vine on ceremonial occasions; and like the living king, the royal Twin is carried on the right shoulder of its bearer (Plates 7 and 8).',\n",
       "  'The best proof of the consistency with which the Kágaba have developed their view of the mastery of the demons is given by the existence of the Hiséi mask, that is, the mask-demon of the dead. Without knowing the activity of this mask, one would have to assume, according to previous information, that here the dead or death-demon would be used in order to save people from death. To be sure, that is not given directly from the tasks of the mask, but from the remarkable name hiséi huvéi for all kinds of the magical stone powder wrapped in maize leaves 2 . Ahuba = covering. , which is used for the most varied protective purposes, but especially as a means against sickness and to drive away death. A means against death is at the same time a means of death, just as a song against a demon is a song of the mask-demon concerned. Now the Hiséi mask is a demon who has to look after all the preparations for festivals, in particular the festive foods. Among these, moreover, the food for christenings is mentioned in particular ( 27, 2), which, like the complete act of christening, is intended for keeping the newborn child alive. Furthermore, the hut for the first cohabitation of newlywed couples is called hiséi huvéi, like the stone powder in its wrapper, for here, as at the christening, it is used to preserve future life. And finally it is one of the foremost tasks at any festival to protect the dancers and the whole village from sickness. We must assume that the festive foods also serve this purpose more than would appear at first glance. A particular concern of the Hiséi mask is therefore a concern about the canchi fruit, which is used as festive food, to which there belongs a special two-day dance so that the fruit may not be eaten by animals. If one recalls the heavenly origin of this fruit and the detailed narrative about its spread across the land of the Kágaba ( 5, 23 ff.), one may deduce from that its importance as a festive food, and, to be sure, its importance for health, because it is the “death mask” which has assumed concern for it. Among other things the Hiséi mask says: “Sweep in front of the temple, sweep the rubbish together well, so that no puma and no snake may eat me, (for) I fear them” ( 31, 5). That means, speaking from the developmental history of this demon: The sweeping in front of the temple 91 must be done so that no sickness may come, for the puma personifies these. And in connection with the snake, one can probably think immediately of the deadly bite of the poisonous snakes, which are quite common there. Since his mask with the snout-like jaw and the big teeth in it is supposed to represent the puma and on both sides it bears a carved snake (Ill. 31), this clearly expresses the fact that the snake is part of his character, just as sickness is. Since the all-mother herself attends to all ceremonies (p. 97), he comes here from her for the festival and then returns to her in his temple-mountain ( 31, 7). He lives with her, as does the priestly demon Muluku, who is related to him (p. 136). And just as the latter formerly lived on earth, the Hiséi mask was already taking care of the canchi fruit “when he was still a man,” that is, when he was still alive ( 27, 2). This mask too thus belongs among the activity-demons, as did the preceding beings, because it personifies the human means against sickness and death, but it no longer rests on nature. The new foundation is an abstract one: death or the dead.',\n",

There are several works available which include chapters on the traditional beliefs of the Baganda and so it is only necessary to summarise these and in places to clarify the picture. The Baganda believe in several forms of spirits; balubaale (hero-gods), mayembe (literally meaning horns, but referring to spirits residing in horns or other receptacles), mizimu (the ghosts of dead ancestors), misambwa (spirits associated with certain animals, rivers, rocks or forests) and kitambo (a spirit usually causing people to walk naked at night and eat dead bodies). Difficulties arise when discussing the cause of illnesses with patients and their families as Bennett et al. (1964) discovered when asking about childhood diarrhoea. Although relatives admitted that a possible cause was obusobe, a ritual mistake made in pregnancy or infancy ( obusobya, a mistake) none admitted that this was the reason for their own child’s diarrhoea. The Baganda do, in fact, have a proverb ‘Lubaale agoba nsonga’ nga takutidde wuwo . (A Lubaale punishes with reason, provided that it has not killed one of your own relatives). Although there are said to be some diseases which result from the breaking of certain taboos, it does not seem to be an important reason in these days.

He says that although one reads of such illnesses in the literature, “I never heard of a specific case of anyone with the disease, and when I approached it from the other end, by asking what would happen if anyone did break the taboo, people were pretty sceptical whether anything would.” He says also (p. 46) “People will tell you that buko is an illness that people get through committing incest, but when you ask what happens to a man who commits incest and is not prosecuted they will say “nothing.”.” ).',\n",

This god did not like the odor of sweetgrass: it was sweet and he liked the odor of only unclean things. Hence by performing the rite in the southwest of the lodge and by waving objects in that direction, it was believed that the deity of disease was pushed farther from the village and that the village itself was thereby freed from disease [Murie 1981:16].',\n",

A shaman must diagnose the cause and sometimes figuratively pull the spirit or demon out, often with the help of his own spirits. To prepare, a shaman frequently decorates himself and his surroundings handsomely and invariably inhales a hallucinogenic snuff to aid contact with the HEKIRA.

       "  'Buganda’s borders were also maintained through ritual means. Human and animal victims, called byonzire, were taken across the border to Bunyoro and Busoga and sacrificed, both to rid Buganda of dangerous diseases and to “cleanse” Buganda’s armies when they returned from military expeditions. The border regions were also protected by the national gods. In northern Bulemeezi county near Buganda’s northeastern frontier with Bunyoro and Busoga stood the shrine of lubaale Kawumpuli, the god of the plague (Frontispiece). This temple contained an underground chamber in which the god remained trapped, thereby restricting the plague to this virtually unpopulated region. The temple of the war god Kibuuka (Frontispiece) was located at Mbale in Mawokota county in the western part of the kingdom, which formerly belonged to Bunyoro. According to legend, Kibuuka was a powerful Ganda warrior who was killed by the Banyoro at this site, and after his death he became a god. Kibuuka’s priests advised the king about warfare on Buganda’s western and northern frontiers and supervised the ritual procedures associated it. The temple of the second war god, Nnende (Frontispiece), was located in the eastern part of the country at Bukerere in Kyaggwe county, next to Busoga. Nnende’s priests protected this frontier, which in the late nineteenth century was regarded as Buganda’s private “back door” ( mmanyu ), through which large quantities of plundered slaves, cattle, and plantains were regularly brought into the country (Nsimbe 1950: 208). The greater part of the southern boundary of the kingdom was formed by the offshore Ssese Islands of Lake Victoria, called Nnaalubaale, or “Mother of the Gods.” Mukasa was the chief god of the lake, and his main temple was located on Bubembe Island (Frontispiece). His priests governed all the traffic across the lake and controlled Buganda’s large fleet of war canoes. Strategically placed and heavily subsidized by annual tribute from the king, the temples of Buganda’s important national gods—Kawumpuli, Kibuuka, Nnende, and Mukasa—played an important role in maintaining the political and ritual integrity of the kingdom.',\n",

If the heir fails in these duties, the spirit will punish him; but the spirit itself does not remain in continuous contact with those it has left behind. Its active intervention is practically confined to visitations in which it expresses anger at some injury. This is done by “possessing” one of its descendants. The spirit is supposed to enter the stomach by the mouth and cause a type of indigestion known as kigalanga, whose first symptom is said to be a very cold feeling. This is regarded as the manifestation par excellence of spirit possession, but many other illnesses may be ascribed to this cause.',\n",

The Kogi almost never use medicinal plants and regard them as “belonging” to the Colombians. “To cure sickness, the Mother gave us stones,” they say, and only in rare cases, when dealing with minor ailments, are infusions of herbs used. The medicinal plants thus used are the following: manzanilla (Matricaria chamomilla), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.), thyme (Thymus vulgaris D.), viravira (Gnaphalium spp.), and sometimes quina bark (Cinchona spp.) ( 100 .

We were engaged with the help of some of the local men in pitching our tent about two hundred yards from the village when we noticed a man, evidently stone blind, come walking towards us, feeling about with a long cane as a blind man does. Two or three children stood watching him and kept warning him of the tide cracks, which were numerous here in the ice as they are everywhere near shore. The children kept shouting to him: ‘Turn to the right! Turn to the left! Again to the left! Now watch out for a tide crack!’ These cracks are dangerous to a man [272] who walks carelessly, for they are often covered with snow so as to be invisible and are wide enough for a man's foot to slip in, with considerable danger not only of a bad fall but of breaking a bone. With skill acquired through long blindness he avoided the tide cracks dexterously and walked straight up to where the children's voices told him that I was standing beside our sled, unloading it.\",\n",

In July, 1906, when Moulton observed with his Pawnee informants, Saturn was in the south as the sun rose. The fact that Saturn would have been visible might have prompted a discussion about the planet that resulted in Moulton’s entry. One would expect that an astronomer would take the opportunity to discuss all of the naked-eye planets, visible or not. The letter is not clear as to whether or not the Star of Disease was observed or whether it was definitely associated with Saturn. We have already seen some of the implications of this object, if it is Saturn, in our analysis of planetary conjunctions that may relate to Morning Star ceremonies. The fact that Saturn is frequently in conjunction with the other planets could have had an important bearing on such things as the sacrifice to the Morning Star, especially if it was associated with the idea of ill-health or disease.',\n",
       "  'That nothing good could be expected from the dead we have already seen from the stone powders and the stone beads that are strewn on the graves or buried there in order to avoid sickness. When the sun went down from the middle ( 15, 6), the dead person came to the huts in order to devour the survivors, that is, to make them sick, and that is why he is buried on the first afternoon after his death; thus, if he died in the afternoon, he would be buried immediately. This was the time of the dead, when they were active and also could most easily be driven away. That is also why cohabitation with the widow occurred during this first night. Hiséi keihi (to make free, or to remove, the dead) was also the name of the last act of the burial ceremony, the strewing of the black stone powder seikuitsi over the grave (cf. Ch. V: “Stone Magic”). The deceased is put in a crouching position with the knees drawn up; the hands are put, palms together, against the left cheek; and he is wrapped in a woman’s garment, since this was formerly also the garb of the men. In this position he is put in a hammock, which is hung on a pole, and carried to the grave-yard in the vicinity of the village. The relatives follow, in part weeping, but not shrieking. The round grave is approximately one and a half meters deep. The deceased in placed in this with his face toward the south, toward the snow-capped mountain Takindúe -- as I was told -- to which the soul goes. The hammock is taken back again. Even today sêveral things are still given to the deceased in the grave, but now there is no longer any rule governing this. Priest Miguel says that his father Narciso gave his golden festival adornment to a friend to keep during a trip, but the latter’s son later said that he had put the things in the grave with his father, who had died in the meantime, which was believed and respected. The place of the grave can also still be distinguished later. Merely the 131 later strewing of stone powder and planting of stone beads calls for that. But for the uninitiated no distinguishing marks are present. Some said that one laid a stone slab on it. And in fact in the cemetery of Noavaka, as my boy Telesforo Gutierrez reported to me, there were two of the characteristic stone installations which one also finds elsewhere in the land of the Kágaba, especially in the neighborhood of the temples. and which to the uninformed look like stone seats, since they consist of a thin slab of stone lying on the ground and another set upright against it like the back of a chair. Moreover three and two of these respectively stand in a row in front of the door of the two temples in Nabuvakai (Ill. 36), one behind the temple of the Kasikiál, others near the temple in Noavaka. They are called hakuktú (stone slab), also haksinkana, perhaps from sinika (striped, striped stone), and were also in these cases explained as seats of the priests. On the other hand, the row of stones close to Takina on the north consisted of similar stone-installations, which were explained as field crops (of. p. 105). Still others about ten minutes above and below Takina on the way to Makotama and San Miguel were explained as helpers ( háñguakukui ) of the temple of Takina, which are supposed to inform the priest of the arrival of sicknesses and other dangers. There were none in the region of Palomino, only one stone installation in the valley of the Rio Kavikongui not far from Santa Rosa, and seven more below Noavaka, in addition to those already listed from there previously. That is also why my informants from Palomino were unable to say anything about them. /The remainder of the text, pp. 132-414, is omitted in the translation.

Usually they are arranged in the form of a wreath so that they give the effect of a head circlet (Ill. 9), but sometimes they are scattered through the hair at random. The ornamental idea, however, plays only a secondary role in this case, for this feather covering is regarded as a trophy. In the opinion of these Indians, sickness and evil in general come from hostile tribes, above all from the Waiká. They are caused by magical performances of the medicine men, who for this use these birds or bats as transmitters, in whose bodies they send their own souls. Now if the Surára and Pakidái kill such an animal, they believe that a hostile medicine man has at the same time met his end (see also pp.211 and 229).',\n",

If the hunter had rubbed on a mixture of tallow and parakaha, a fragrant herb, to prevent sunburn, this, too, could be washed off with river sand.

More sociologically persuasive is the story that the powerful landlord Chang Pi-jung fell ill and, having heard of Pao Sheng Ta Ti's powers, asked one of his foremen to worship the god on his behalf. Chang immediately recovered and, to thank the god, contributed a large sum of money to build him the temple known as the Chi-an Kung or Ta Tao Kung Miao. There is also the possibility that T'an-ti's location near the wharf over which all imports and exports had to pass gave Pao Sheng Ta Ti the advantage of a location conducive to widespread renown. Still another possibility is that Pao Sheng Ta Ti served to “mediate” ethnic contradictions that gave rise to many conflicts and much distrust. The Lais who brought Pao Sheng Ta Ti to Shu-lin were Chang-chou people from Nan-ching and P'ing-ho, but tradition has it that Pao Sheng Ta Ti was a famous official in T'ung-an and therefore a respected deity among a large proportion of the Ch'üan-chou population.\",\n",
       "  'Saar in Somali describes a state of possession by a spirit also called saar . The extreme symptoms are frenzy, fits, or madness, and the spirit itself is, in the Islamic setting, described as a kind of jinn whose malignant powers cause certain types of sickness. Among the eastern tribes of northern Somaliland ‘invisible’ wadaad (see above) act similarly to saar but have less serious effects and are merely responsible for some minor forms of illness. Saar can be expelled by persons who have acquired mastery over the spirits through having themselves been previously possessed. In northern Somaliland such ‘doctors’ ( alaqa ) are generally women, for visitation is here confined almost exclusively to this sex, especially to the wealthy. Rich women who believe that a saar is troubling them have recourse to an alaqa: poor women cannot afford to be afflicted by saar because treatment is costly. Such an illogical situation leads sceptical Somalis to abandon their belief in saar . This is not the place nor is there at present sufficient material on the social contexts in which saar are active, to enter into a sociological discussion of the subject. It seems possible, however, that we are concerned with a form of the witchcraft which is associated with wealth and polygamy elsewhere and which serves as a vehicle for jealousy and as a buttress of social status. Saar are expelled in the ‘dance of the saar ’ which is apparently fairly extensively practised in Somalia although violently opposed by Muslim wadaad . In northern Somaliland, where official opposition is such that many devout Muslims deny its existence, 1 In fact in 1955 the British Somaliland Protectorate Advisory Council unanimously agreed that legislation should be introduced to make the practice of saar rites illegal. War Somali Sidihi, No. 60, 23 April 1955. the dance is sometimes still performed by women. It seems that the dance acts as a form of exorcism of the malevolent jinn causing possession, and perhaps less frequently as a means of attaining possession. In Somalia, the opening movement is called or-goys and consists of those assembled beginning to sing and to raise their arms rhythmically towards the sky. Soon someone falls in a faint and his companions ‘beat the saar ’, forming a circle round him and breaking into ‘the song of the saar ’, sung at first slowly and then with increasing tempo. Drumming, castanet-playing, and handclapping swell the singing. Slowly the fallen dancer revives, and moving his limbs in rhythm, seizes a knife or lighted brand which he thrusts between his teeth and dances into the semi-circle formed by the others. The tempo increases until the dancer again succumbs and falls panting to the ground. After a little he rises completely restored and the saar is said to have left him. 2 Among the Cushitic Agao of Gondar in northern Ethiopia, the refractions of the Sky God ( Zar ) which possess people are called zar, are associated especially but not exclusively with women, are inherited in the family, and have genealogies corresponding to their territorial distribution (Leiris, 1934 (1), 134, 126). The dance is widely distributed among the Cushitic peoples of north-east Africa and often the possessed dancer acts as an oracle 3 The After (Danakil) of southern Eritrea and of Ethiopia have a similar ceremony in which the possessed dancer is called jenile (jinn?) . See Licata, 1885, 267; Thesiger, 1935, 8. (see Leiris, 1934). Beyond the Cushitic areas, it occurs as far away as Egypt (Kahle, 1912), the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (Trimingham, 1949, pp. 174-7), and even the Hijaz (Hurgronje, 1888-9, II, pp. 124-8). The explanation seems to be that the saar (Zar) dance has spread far beyond the bounds of Cushitic culture with the export of slaves from Ethiopia where it has its Cushitic origin (Cerulli, 1933, II, p. 35).',\n",

Illnesses believed to be curable by girka are extremely varied and range from impotence, infertility, insanity, and paralysis to rashes and boils. Each specific illness or set of symptoms is symbolically linked to the actions of a specific spirit. No less important to an understanding of girka but perhaps less directly stated in the actions of participants, the ritual identifies the recruitment of a new cult-adept. This is symbolized by the definition of a successful cure as one which results in the attainment of harmony or reconciliation between the sufferer and the iskoki diagnosed to have caused his illness. The continued obligation of the former sufferer to obey the commands of the spirits on his head is expressed in the description of him as a ‘horse of the gods’ as well as in the denial that a cured person has been exorcized of the afflicting spirits.

If an Andaman Islander be asked why he paints himself with white clay, or why he wears a belt or necklace of Dentalium shell he replies that he does so in order to look well; but if he be asked why he wears a string of human bones round his head or neck or waist, he gives quite a different answer, to the effect that he does so in order to protect himself from dangers of a special kind.

Thus while some things are worn on the body in order to improve the personal appearance, and consequently, as explained above, to give the individual a sense of his own value, others are worn because they are believed to have a protective power, and thereby arouse in the person a sense of security.

It seems as if the Illapurinja has never been a very popular form of avenging an injury, and is very rarely mentioned except when a medicine man discovers that one of his patients, who has been seized with sudden and unaccountable illness, is suffering from the attack of an Illapurinja. As usual, the natives when questioned on the subject said that though they knew all about it, yet it was a custom which they did not practise or, rather, had not practised for many years, but that it was prevalent somewhere else. It is only a few years since a man was out hunting euros near to Alice Springs, and was attacked by an Illapurinja who had come from an outlving group. He was picked up insensible (the day. was a very hot one, and in all probability the case was one of sunstroke), and brought into camp in a dazed condition. Under the treatment of an able medicine man, whose services were fortunately available, he recovered, after the extraction from his body of a number of pieces of a wooden Churinga.',\n",

The third native class of ailments handles categories (1) through (5) in Western taxonomy but according to a system of causation not recognized by Western or even Chinese secular medicine. The villagers believe that if the cause of a cold is fright or offense, then you will not get well without treating that supernatural cause. There is no use taking such a problem to a Western-style doctor, since he will not be able to recognize or see its true cause and will therefore be unable to treat it successfully. Many doctors do not come from a rural background. Those who do have been in regular or cram school ever since age 7. Whatever they once knew of religion, folk beliefs, and supernatural danger has been virtually drowned in the secular “rational” theories of Western science and medicine. In fact, young men whose sisters, sisters-in-law, mothers, and grandmothers still went to see gods, bumped into ghosts, made soul baskets, and checked the fates of their children, would confidently assure me, “No one does that anymore.” The one market town doctor who appeared to know about these ailments told us in no uncertain terms that, when superstitions were mentioned by the parents, he just informed them they were wrong.',\n",
       "  \"Gluckman has analysed the Lozi cult of the royal ancestors in terms of the local dispersal of the ultimate unity and mystical power of the kingship. Each king or princess chief is buried in a huge grave encircled by a fence with the pointed stakes and the lashings of royalty. Trees are planted round it, an outstanding feature in the treeless Plain. The “sleeping chief” is believed still to rule the neighbourhood and its people. He or she may cause good or ill fortune to befall the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, “who are known to it,” but his power is not limited by distance, since any royal grave can afflict any member of the royal line anywhere, cause misfortune to the whole of Loziland, or trouble any Lozi, even in White country, if it knows of him and his ancestors, especially if he is a member of the political sector attached to the royal grave. Each grave has its resident priests, appointed by the king in council. The priests make national offerings at the king's orders, and the cult is under his control. Individuals make offerings through the priests and if a spirit has been particularly troublesome the king himself may make offerings to it, through the mediation of the priests. According to Holub 4 Holub, 1881. and Louis Jalla. 5 Jalla, Louis, 1928. royal ancestors are regarded as intermediaries between Nyambe and the living. The relation between the Nyambe cult and the cult of the royal ancestors is by no means clear. The royal ancestors are sometimes entreated to intercede with Nyambe to restore someone to health and sometimes they are themselves regarded as the cause of disease. There is one priest of Nyambe who is first given a portion of all tribute; and in national extremity he makes offerings to Nyambe . 6 Gluckman, 5, 1943, p. 93.\",\n",
       "  \"Nowadays when illness strikes, the villagers observe its symptoms and try to determine its nature. From experience with certain basic sets of symptoms, illnesses are distinguished as being either in the realm of the physiological or supernatural, and therefore requiring a cure within that particular realm. Thanks to the villagers' new awareness of the germ theory of disease, most illnesses are immediately classified as physiological and, therefore, within the domain of science and medicine -- primarily modern, Western-style medicine rather than Chinese herbal medicine. Such illnesses as measles, rashes and skin diseases, trachoma, colds, stomach disorders supposedly resulting from bad food or water, and the like, all fall clearly into this category. To treat these illnesses, it is now customary for the villagers either to call in a Western-style practitioner or to choose their own drugs or patent medicines.\",\n",

       "  'Ghosts of the dead and other private spirits who are given the title of bonga form part of the stock-in-trade of the two classes of people among the Santals who deal regularly with the occult—the magicians and the witches. They are bitterly opposed to each other’s influence, and they clash for the most part on the battleground of sickness and disease. An exhaustive treatise on the Santal attitude to disease has been published, and shows conclusively that, as with ghosts so with sickness, the ideas of the Santals are common to all the lower strata of society in North India. 1 P. O. Bodding, Studies in Santal Medicine and Connected Folklore, Memoirs of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. X. These ideas are not simple but complex, and range from the realm of the rational to the fantastic. Disease is sometimes ascribed to natural causes, particularly when the chain of causation is fairly obvious and can be repeated in a series of experiments; there is a whole class of food described as batol, which means that it is unwholesome. There are hundreds of remedies that require no supernatural aid to make them effective. Some remedies are the property of all, while others are the property of individuals and the knowledge of their ingredients is a closely guarded secret. Chaitan of Churimara began his career as a physician in response to a specific need. When he was a young man a friend had come to him in great distress and said that his boy was vomiting blood. He turned to Chaitan and asked him if he knew of any medicine that would be good for the boy. Chaitan was so sorry for his friend that he promised to do something, although when he said this he had no notion what he should do. As he was setting out for his friend’s house he prayed to Cando and asked that he might be shown what he ought to do; at the same time he shut his eyes and kicked at the soil. As he opened his eyes again he saw a plant, which he immediately dug up. He ground the roots to make a medicine, and the boy recovered from his sickness. Since then he has applied the same remedy to many other cases. One of his patients had been extremely ill, he said, but was now the father of four or five children! He has been in great demand as a physician, and claims that Cando subsequently revealed many remedies to him. Sometimes it is claimed that remedies are made known in dreams. The plant that was first revealed to Chaitan was the upel tandi plant, which has a red flower.',\n",

Strangely enough, these people, otherwise so brave, intrepid, and even ruthless with themselves, appear as though broken, wholly cast down, and completely despondent when a serious illness or a bad accident strikes them. I am inclined to trace this phenomenon back to their character, which completely and without resistance adapts to every situation of life. (68) This resignation, however, may not, as Gallardo:293 suspects, “atribuirlo al hecho de saber el paciente que será abandonado si se agrava /be ascribed to the fact of the patient's knowing that he would be abandoned if he became worse/”; it was not customary among the Selk'nam to leave a sick person to his fate so that he thereby perished (p. 681). That is, the Indian silently locks his teeth on brief, penetrating pain, hot stinging wounds, a sharp blow, and bears it all with cold-blooded resignation. A person who cannot rise from his sickbed is surrounded by the sympathy of all, even though they cannot help. But with sincere love he is offered everything that pleases him or that is desired by him; in fact, many a sick person has been gravely harmed by excessive tenderness and inappropriate help. (69) Absolutely without justification Gallardo: 293 limits to the slightly ill ones the anxious, readily helpful co-operation of those around them; of course, in reality all are “cuidados con cariño por sus parientes, cariño que en muchas ocasiones les causa la muerte, como sucede en los casos en que convendría la dieta y que por el contrario les dan todo lo que piden /cared for with affection by their relatives, affection that on many occasions caused their death, as happened in the cases in which diet was important and, on the contrary, they gave them all that they asked for/.”\",\n",

But contact with the whites brought new illnesses for which they had no cures. Smallpox, diphtheria, tuberculosis, venereal diseases, and others for the most part resisted all their known curing techniques, and the tribe saw great numbers die in the nineteenth century. The realization that white man’s medicine should cure white man’s diseases was logically apparent to the Pawnees and they accepted such innovations as vaccination. In 1870, Dr. George L.

The writer remembers the following: An old woman, who was commonly believed to be, and for that matter also acknowledged herself to be, a witch, died. When she was being burnt, she raised one arm and one leg up. This was considered ominous. A short time afterwards two of her grandchildren died. The village people firmly believed that the old women had wanted these children to follow after her. . “The husband,” they said, “has taken this girl away; it was he who would not let her off.

Anyone who still wanted to eat something late in the evening, whether man or woman -- children are given nothing more late at night --, was obliged to throw a small piece of meat , raw or roasted, outside the hut; a short distance was sufficient. Turning his thoughts to T má kel , often without speaking his name, he would say softly: “I am going to eat now. This here is for ‘You-up-there’: Be good to us!” Although they expressly emphasize that their god does not eat (p. 715), this fixed formula is retained. This had to be done so that the person in question “would not feel stomach pains during the night!” The next morning, they say further, that piece of meat is no longer to be found; T má kel himself causes it to disappear, although he himself does not eat. But “the eater should remain aware of the fact that ‘The-one-up-there’ sees what every person down here is doing!” 512 cont. It is difficult to determine which, in the interpretation of the Indians, should be more strongly emphasized: The giving of a small portion of the food, say, in the manner of a first-fruits offering, or the thought of the omnipresence of the Supreme Being. The fact that the piece of meat has disappeared the next morning is naturally explained by the many dogs that run around there.',\n",

An epileptic may sleep in the kitchen, which is usually a separate hut away from the main house. Any youth, however, when he is old enough to begin having sexual relations will be expected to sleep under a different roof from his parents. Children with epilepsy will not be allowed to play with others and the parents of the others will warn their own children to keep away and not to play together with them. The result of these beliefs is that when an epileptic has a fit everyone runs away. If he should fall in the fire or into water it is quite likely that no one will pull him out and he will be left to burn or drown. A few informants said that they recognised that epilepsy was not infectious and others said that the isolation they were subjected to was not only due to its supposed infectious nature, but because of the unpleasant and rather frightening nature of the fits themselves. Epileptics also tend to be dirty although in many cases this is due to their isolation and lack of the usual socialising influences. There may also be a certain amount of fear of the strange behaviour sometimes displayed by the patient on recovery from a fit.',\n",
       "  \"Although people often say that “you have to do something for the soul of a daughter or she will come back and cause trouble,” it is my impression that serious misfortunes are more likely to be attributed to wives of the line than daughters of the line. Because married women have more rights than unmarried women, there is more likely to be understandable grounds for indignation on the part of a deceased wife. One of the most common sources of trouble is the failure of a second wife to respect the rights of her predecessor. In addition to the right to a place on her husband's altar, a married woman also has the right to expect her replacement to treat her “like an older sister.” The second wife should pay a formal visit to the first wife's home immediately after her marriage and thereafter observe all of the duties of a daughter with respect to her predecessor's parents. She should also prepare special foods for the first wife on her deathday and say, “I hope older sister will protect me and help take care of the children.” One of my most reliable informants told me that his father's sister had died shortly after marriage and that her husband's second wife had not visited their family. “Her children were sick all the time until she did this, but then everything was all right.

Hence it behoved the living, and especially the relations upon whom the care and welfare of the ghosts depended, to be ever watchful for their interests; otherwise the ghosts would retaliate and cause illness and death in the clan. A favourite place of the ghosts was among the trees and plantains in the gardens, where they made sport, especially at noon when the sun shone brightly; on this account children were warned against going out to play in the gardens during the heat of the day, and even adults did not enter them at this time, unless they were obliged to do so. When the wind blew softly and murmured in the leaves of the trees, the ghosts were said to be talking to one another, and when a whirlwind occurred and carried up the dust and the leaves the ghosts were said to be at play. Ghosts hung about the graves in which their bodies lay buried; nothing would induce them to go far away from the spot except the removal of the body or of some particular portion of it. The special portion of the body to which a ghost clung was the lower jawbone (lwanga); when once this was taken away the ghost would follow it to the ends of the earth, and would be quite satisfied to remain with the jawbone if it were honoured. This supposed knowledge of the way to control a ghost has been acted upon for many years; there are jawbones of men, who lived nearly a thousand years ago, preserved to this day by members of the clan to which they belonged; and they are regarded as a most precious heirloom. The possession of the jawbone of a member of the clan would (it was thought) bring good fortune.

The Bahúkiwa, at least those with whom I discussed the subject, did not believe that the umé might fail to return and so cause death.

At death, the umé leaves the body permanently, journeying after a suitable interval to a nearby river, dwelling of the spirits. After death the umé has human form.

It was said that men know charms to make rain to fall, the sun to shine, and to stop adverse winds, and that such knowledge is usually transmitted in certain families, men teaching their sons or their sisters' children. A charm for stopping rain is to chew ginger which is then expectorated in a fine spray, a formula which ends in a high-pitched sibilant -- s -- s being muttered the while. The same process with different words is used when it is desired to make the wind abate, and I believe that this process with appropriate words is used to propitiate or avert any possibly dangerous influence, as for instance that which a stranger may reasonably be expected to exert.

       "  'The manang looks upon a sick person as being possessed with an evil spirit, and as long as this evil spirit remains in possession the patient cannot regain his health, he conjures it to depart; if it be obstinate and will not go he summons his own familiar spirit, and requests it to show him in what way the tormentor may be prevailed upon to take its departure. He acts upon its suggestions and propitiates it with sacrifices; but if it still prove obstinate and refuse to budge, the manang admits his inability to deal with it, and some other wizard is called in who is believed to have at his command a more powerful familiar. Whether the patient live or die the manang is rewarded for his pains; he makes sure of that before he undertakes the case, for he is put to considerable inconvenience, being fetched away from his own home and obliged to take up his abode with his patient; he can therefore undertake only one case at a time, but to it he devotes his whole attention. He takes his meals with the family, and in other ways makes himself quite at home. If a cure be effected he receives a valuable present in addition to his ordinary expenses. Herbal remedies are frequently administered by him, and a diet enjoined. Such treatment works wonders in all simple disorders, and not unnaturally, but to enhance the value of the cure, spells are muttered and cabalistic verses recited exorcising the foul fiend that is tormenting the body. I have known manangs to have administered in this way European medicines procured from the Government dispensary, for they are wide awake and ready at all times to avail themselves of remedies of known efficacy. Every regular manang is supposed to be attended by a familiar spirit who is good and powerful; but it often happens that the evil spirit is the more powerful of the two, and when this is the case the sick man cannot recover, and death ensues. By death they understand the flight, of the soul out of the body. When a person complains of pain in the body the familiar will often suggest that some mischievous devil has put something into him to cause the pain. The manang will thereupon manipulate the part and pretend by some sleight of hand to draw something out of it, a stick, or a stone, or whatever it may chance to be, which, no doubt, he has previously concealed about his person, and he will hand it about and exhibit it as the cause of the pain in the body, which he has thus been able to remove without so much as leaving a mark on the skin.',\n",

He had many children, seven, I believe, and one white bull on which his children rode when visiting neighbors, itimni. It happened that someone stole his bull and thus made it impossible for him to move about with his children. The children began to get sick and cry from hunger, and drove the old man to such a point that he dug a pit, put the children in it, and lit a fire over them. When the children began to choke and die he struck his tambourine and, walking around the fire, began to perform a shamanistic rite and utter his grieviances against mankind. In return for the injury he had suffered Ulu-toen gave him the right to take away a child for every hair on the bull. Since this time the old man, turned into an er , has gone about crippling and killing children. Not a single shaman could overcome him, but now he has received the full quota of children alloted to him and has become harmless, as a result of his old age and infirmity. When he now visits someone he is not given what he asks for, but simply taken by the neck and thrown out. (Namsk Ulus, 1887). It is characteristic of the Yakut shamanistic pantheon that for the most part the secondary spirits are former shamans or people who had somehow been injured, or in general suffered, while on this earth. To their titles is always added the clan name, which again indicates the tie between the Yakut cult of shamanism and their clan organization and their clan history. 2 In the Zapadno Kangalas Ulus I was even shown a tiny circular island in the middle of a small lake, on which the yurt of Dampay-Braday had once supposedly stood; this was not in the Bologur Nasleg, but in the Oktemsk Nasleg.',\n",

       "  \"Most of the Onges, in their native surroundings, remain very dirty. Under the conditions, the hygiene is almost unknown to them. In most of the cases, washing and cleaning are not done. The bodies of men and women remain almost perpetually covered with clay, mixed with pig or turtle's fat. They just do not bother to clean it and rather keep on giving new layers when the old ones get removed. Because of such a procedure, their bodies keep on emitting unpleasant odour. In this respect, what Cipriani wrote continues to hold true. Accordingly, the more a wife loves her husband the more magnificent designs she executes on him. The paintings on their bodies reach a peak every two or three days, as the Onges feel illness and death if they are not newly daubed, and the face, at least, must be continually painted with at least smear on the chest, arms and legs. Painting of clay on the body is done for various purposes such as for curing of diseases, to decorate on various occasions, to show affection to the husband, in mourning, in menses and for killing pigs. The practice also gives way to various kinds of skin diseases. The diseases of skin are comparatively more common among the Onges. They keep on scratching their hands, feet and the down portion of the abdomen having slightly elevated rashes. Among skin diseases, ring worm is quite common. Apart from skin, the internal diseases, among the Onges are not uncommon. The weather conditions, unhygienic food and other environmental conditions have their own role in causing such diseases. The raw material for food is not properly cleaned. It is boiled in dirty water containing mud and dust. The utensil in which the food is cooked is hardly cleaned. It is used over and over again without being cleaned. Layers of dirt keep on accumulating on the utensils used for cooking and eating purposes. The dogs also eat the left-overs in the same containers. In an Onge camp, slightly beyond Butler Bay, I for the first time saw the pork being cooked by the Onges. When I reached the camp, I found no Onge attending to the cooking. They were relaxing in their Korales. About two yards from one of the corner huts, I observed an eighteen litre tin-container (without any cover), all black from outside with the accumulation of soot, kept on three small stones having fire underneath. The tin-container was almost full of pork pieces and water. Nothing else was added to it. As the fast wind was blowing, there was enough of sand, dust and tree leaves lying on the water surface inside the tin. All these were being boiled with the pork. No Onge was coming to remove them or to cover the tin with something. Sometimes the dogs would come and peep into the tin. When talked to the Onges, it was responded that this is their usual way of cooking. Soon after the pork is boiled, it would be distributed to all the members and consumed as it is. Thus, the pork along with other unwanted material, goes inside the stomachs of the Onges. Such practices ultimately cause stomach upset, dysentry and other related troubles. The large communal huts of the Onges are dark from inside and quite congested. The cooking is also done inside the hut, either near the respective beds or in the middle of the huts. Lots of bones and skulls are found hanging inside the hut. There is too much of smoke inside and soot layers are often seen in the ceiling of the hut. The conditions in the hut are not healthy.\",\n",

       "  'We shall now see how these annual ceremonies of the dances of the masks are performed. Once the day for the beginning of the ceremony has been determined by divination, the whole town is cleaned, and the road which leads from it to the nearby stream or river, where those attending will take their ritual baths, is repaired. Then the Máma lights a fire in the ceremonial house by means of a drill, afterwards feeding the flames with certain woods which have been brought exclusively for this purpose. 142 In the meantime the fire is extinguished in all of the houses and is then lighted again with embers which each man brings from the ceremonial house to his dwelling. In the afternoon the Máma and his assistants, as well as the men of status who will take an active part in the dance, leave the town and go to a nearby house, to the one belonging to the Máma or to one belonging to some Elder, where the masks and other ritual objects have been deposited beforehand. There they put on the costumes, ornaments, and masks, and at nightfall they come back to the town. Some men play large gourd trumpets announcing the arrival of the masks, but otherwise the participants proceed silently in single file. Upon arriving in the town, they then pass through its plaza and all enter the ceremonial house, walking first toward the east, then toward the west, south, and north, respectively, all with short steps, the knees bent, and making bows toward the “four corners of the world.” Meanwhile only the trumpets are played. This entrance of the masks is interpreted as a ceremonial greeting. Halting in the middle of the house, the masks pronounce the ritual greetings and commence a song accompanied by a slow dance, during which the dancers scarcely move from their places, but only rock the body from side to side or abruptly move the head from side to side. In the accompanying song the masks say that they were sent by the Universal Mother to visit the Kogi and to see if “all is in accord.” They ask if there are food and firewood, if all have confessed and fasted, and if the town has been cleaned. After a short time the participants remove the masks and place them on large tripods of stakes, which have been placed along the walls in the interior of the ceremonial house for this purpose. Then the gathering sits down on little benches and hammocks, and periods of conversation, singing and dancing performed by individuals and more of the nature of practicing, follow. Occasionally the Máma intervenes and directs the dancing, inviting all of the men to participate in it. They go on dancing this way through the night, sometimes with the masks, sometimes without them. Now maracas, trumpets, drums, and flutes accompany the songs, and the dancers stop facing in this direction, perhaps just turning their faces and maracas to this side. Thus “the masks speak with the directions” and “keep the bad at a distance and bring the good.” At the same time the Máma receives from the 143 men, dancers or observers, the bundles of mineral dust, opens them, and blows their contents toward the four directions. Many times the men themselves do this and the Máma does not personally intervene. According to the time of year or the special object of the ceremony, they next repeat certain dances and songs, say, the dance of Kandjí, the dance of Namsíku, the dance of the rain, or the many dances which are performed in order to “be in accord” with the animals which damage the crops. In the festivals of the solstices and equinoxes, the next day is devoted to the dance of the mask of Surlí or the one of Nuikukúi (the Master of the East). At dawn the tripods with the masks are placed outside the ceremonial house with the faces turned toward the east “to greet the sun.” In the afternoon, or sometimes even in the morning, the mask of Surlí dances outside or inside the ceremonial house, his dance being accompanied by songs and the sound of the trumpets. At night the masks are brought in again, and the dances and songs continue until dawn, together with the offerings of mineral powder. In the free hours, however, the men devote themselves to small household tasks, eat from time to time, or toast coca leaves in the ceremonial house. No matter what the immediate object of the ceremony may be, whether “to turn the sun around” or “to arrange a rain-shower” (that is to say, to make it rain), the prime concern is always to keep sicknesses away. In the songs they speak of “making fences on the roads of sickness” or of “closing the doors to sickness,” and on occasion the dancers manipulate a small broom of leaves in each hand for the purpose of “sweeping away sickness” and “cleaning the pueblo.”',\n",

       "  'A hunting accident that happened to the headman of a Bará longhouse on the Macucú River illustrates some of these concepts. What follows is a much abbreviated version of an account given me. About twenty years ago, José of Anüyuhtí longhouse went to hunt white-lipped peccaries. He shot one, which was especially fierce because its mate was about to give birth. The peccary gored José in the knee, but he killed it with his dogs. He limped back to the longhouse, carrying the dead peccary. The wound got very bad. Old Arturo, the most knowledgeable of Bará shamans, started a curing chant, but José was ready to die. His feet were already cold and only his heart moved. Old Arturo went to Ewüra wi, a longhouse near Ewüra taró. 19 S. Hugh-Jones (personal communication) states that the Makuna and Taiwano eat snakes. He saw José already there, standing outside the door. He was putting on black body paint, festive ornaments, and feathers. His mother and his father were there, and many people awaited him. José had almost finished painting himself and was about to enter the longhouse. If he had entered, he would have died in this world. The people at Anüyuhtí were already crying. Old Arturo came and pushed José away from the doorway. Many peccaries were outside the house waiting, and Old Arturo began to scare them with his power. First he summoned a big wind. The peccaries said that wind had been around since the beginning of the world. Then Old Arturo summoned a tremendous fire, which did scare them. They lined up and began to enter the longhouse. He made them shut all the doors, which he closed with big logs. Old Arturo took away their aüawüri (long flutes), taking away their dances, taking away their hearts. When Old Arturo returned to this world, he carried these flutes in his throat, and José recovered. But this is why there are no peccaries in these parts today.',\n",
       "  \"The eldest of the Brethren, Tafito, the Atua i Fangarere, known commonly as the Atua Lasi, the Great God, symbolised both prosperity and disaster. In a variety of unusual ways he was associated with the head . His vegetal symbol, his ‘head’, was the breadfruit, known as mei , but also as te uru fenua , the ‘head of the land’, an indication of its prime place among Tikopia foods ( Primitive Polynesian Economy , 1939, p. 65 ). On the other hand, sprung untimely from the head of his mother, he was cursed as the future bearer of epidemic disease. He was also disaster in another According to Pa Nukutungasau, of Vaisakiri in Fangarere, the rau of the Atua Lasi for the ocean, passed on from his chiefly ancestor Faisangakitetai, who was the founder of the lineage, was Rakaitengaru. This title, ‘Hasten in the Waves’, was a secret one, corresponding to the more well-known one of Tiporokou. Both were ‘evil titles’ ( rau pariki ), his man-eating titles. Under this title the god operated under all the skies known to the Tikopia; he destroyed canoes and ships and crews. From his position in the ocean he would see a vessel above, then rise and stand on the deck, and press it down beneath the waves, after which he would devour the men. The hull did not drift on, as is the usual case with a canoe overwhelmed at sea, but sank down to the bottom. Another method he used to destroy vessels was to part the ocean--‘to separate the path of the vessel’--so that it fell down in a watery cleft and the waves closed over it; he could then eat the crew at leisure. The total loss of craft at sea, with nothing ever heard of them again, was due to him. ‘We think that the canoe has been attacked and destroyed in a foreign land, but no; not slain in another land’ (cf. Work of the Gods , p. 301). So in this transformation the god represents the principle of mysterious disaster at sea, though without any particular ‘head’ referent. But the association between ‘head’ and ‘disaster’, seen already in the bursting out from his mother's head, is carried a step further in a variant of the tale of the killing of Tangaroa (see later.) According to Pae Sao, Tangaroa was not the real victim of the attacker Resa; it was the Atua Lasi, and Tangaroa was the result, the pieces of the shattered head . Tangaroa was ‘the chips of the head of the Atua Lasi’. And a title of the Atua Lasi in Taumako was Te Urupaku, the Dry Head. 1 Paku with short final vowel (ordinarily as pakupaku ) means ‘dry’; paku with stressed long final vowel means to thud with noise, to resound. The latter meaning would seem to fit the attack by Resa, but I think the former was the pronunciation in the name Te Urupaku. Here without much difficulty one can construct a pattern of Lévi-Straussian style: Tafito = original or base bursts through uru = head but without destroying it, and becomes himself uru = head, while incurring further power of bearing destruction; he is himself later destroyed by having his own head burst open, which in turn gives rise to another being; but in one context he is named by a ‘head’ title. Clearly some sense of continuity of theme and of opposed qualities is at work here, though as far as I can see from the data the pattern stops there.\",\n",

The manang is depicted as replicating the past actions of now celestial manang for the benefit of his patient in the terrestrial world; in so doing, he creates a direct link between the unborn child and the benevolent supernatural beings ( petara ); and, simultaneously, he establishes a visible material counterpart of the child's vital principle ( semengat ). Furthermore, he forges these connections at the same time as he erects an ‘unseen spiritual fence’ around the mother and unborn child to thwart malign activity on the part of any less benevolent spirits in the immediate environment. The cordyline remains, after the ritual performance, as a condensed symbol: a representation of the unborn child's vitality and longevity and a channel of power bearing all the authority of the manang tradition. This polysemic character also adheres to the rite itself: described, even named, as a ‘fencing’ and ‘enclosing’, it is simultaneously and just as clearly, a ‘bridging’ and ‘embedding’. This chant, indeed this whole ritual, is an excellent example of the Iban use of botanic metaphors and symbols to represent aspects of the person. Not only do the celestial manang assist in the series of plantings, which culminate in establishing the unborn child's cordyline of longevity, but they are themselves depicted in the pervasive botanic idiom. 13 Sather has described ‘plant symbolism’ as ‘a fundamental element of Iban thought’ (1978b:98). He points out that: Many plants are attributed sacred properties, or function as ritual objects, and floral imagery, symbolizing spiritual powers and relationships, or demarcating realms of gods and spirits, permeates every facet of Iban ritual life (cf. Harrisson and Sandin 1966:56-62). Like men and animals, plants are regarded as a major kind of living thing, sharing the same fundamental properties of life ( idup ) and death ( mati or parai ). In this connection, plants are the basic symbol of life itself to the Iban. The fecundity and flourishing, generative growth of plants is, at an individual level, the prime symbol of human fertility and healthful vigour. Similarly the vulnerability of plants, and their eventual death, provide the basic analogy for impaired human health and mortality ...

       "  \"This already protracted account of Aymara folk-medicine would still be incomplete without mention of a variety of native chiropractic called t'alantaña or c'uimaq'aq'oña . The theory of this Aymara science is that various internal organs, particularly the heart ( c'uimia ), may become physically dislocated kiucxata . By massaging the arms and the torso carefully, and by binding with a wide textile girdle, the visceral dislocations of the patient are reduced, and he is cured. In the t'alanta procedure previously mentioned the patient is also sometimes tossed gently in a poncho held by serveral people, until his organs return to their proper position. The processes of truq'aq'a and p'ic'aq'a involve rubbing certain substances upon the body of the sick person, but with a different motive: to absorb the evil spirit which has entered, so that it may be tempted away by libations and sacrifices. A similar practice is lumaq'a , or “purification.” Some diseases like tertian fever can be cured by frightening the patient severely, for then the evil spirit will abandon his body. One of the fevers, which has the appearance of a skeleton-thin woman with disheveled hair, can be so cured. Tuberculosis, however, which is caused by tall, thin, frozen beings who live by drinking the blood of their victims, is not cured in this way. Typhoid fever can be sidetracked by cutting open a black chicken and placing it on the stomach of the sick person, or by placing his legs in the stomach of a dead dog, or by putting black guineapigs on his body immediately after eviscerating them. The disease of culpa-usu , which is caused by the “penetration” of a bone from the tomb into the body of the victim, can of course only be cured by the removal of the foreign body itself.\",\n",

Sudden sharp pains ( palâs , ńuoll a = “arrow”) are treated by the Kolt-Lapps by having another person pinch the painful spot -- he takes the pain in his own finger-tips, as it were, then blows it away. 1 HÄMÄLÄINEN, Koltta-Lappia, p. 87: The healer spits on his finger-tips, then pinches the sore place as if gradually pulling out the pain.

Almost all sickness in the community is believed to be caused by witchcraft (the term for witch and witcheraft, ak'camel , means “giver of sickness”). The tamily of a sick person consults the local curers, who pulse the patient. The witch “has left his signature in the blood” of the patient, and by pulsing him the curer can “hear and feel” who the witch is. His procedure is to ask the patient to tell what troubles he has had with his neighbors and relatives, and as the patient recites the names of the people with whom he has had conflict, the pulse jumps. As in the use of the lie detector, this indicates where there is high affect: in Teklum it is interpreted as positive indicator of the guilty person, the witch. If the curer gets drunk enough, he may reveal the name of the witch, but he usually prefers not to--I know of at least three cases, one of which is reported here, in which the man who announced the name of the witch was killed by the person he accused.

       "  \"In ordinary cases the patient lies down on the ground while the medicine man bends over, rubs and sucks vigorously at the affected part of the body, spitting out every now and then supposed pieces of wood, bone or stone, the presence of which is believed to be causing the injury and pain. This suction is one of the most characteristic features of native medical treatment, as pain in any part of the body is always supposed to be due to the presence of some foreign body, which must be removed. Amongst especially the Western Arunta the medicine man, in addition to the Atnongara stones, is supposed to have a particular kind of lizard distributed through his body, which endows him with great suctorial power, such as the natives attribute to the lizard itself. In serious cases the action is more dramatic, and the medicine man needs a clear space in which to perform. The patient, perhaps too ill to sit up, is supported by some individual, while the medicine man who has been called in, and may have come a long distance, gravely examines him and consults with other practirioners who may be present, and with the more immediate relatives of the patient, as to the nature of the illness. The diagnosis may occupy some time, during which everyone maintains a very solemn appearance, all conversation being carried on in whispers. As a result the medicine man will perhaps pronounce that the sick man is suffering from a charmed bone inserted by a magic individual, such as a Kurdaitcha; or perhaps, worse still, the verdict is that one of the Iruntarinia has placed in his body an Ullinka or short barbed stick attached to an invisible string, the pulling of which by the malicious spirit causes great pain (Fig. 119 nos. 10, 11). If the latter be the case it requires the greatest skill of a renowned medicine man to effect a cure. While the patient is supported in a half-sitting attitude, the medicine man will first of all stand close by, gazing down upon him in the most intent way. Then suddenly he will go some yards off, and looking fiercely at him, bends slightly forwards and repeatedly jerks his arm outwards at full length, with the hand outstretched, the object being thereby to project some of the Atnongara stones into the patient's body, the object of this being to counteract the evil influence at work within the latter. Going rapidly and with a characteristic high knee action from one end of the cleared space to the other, he repeats the movement with dramatic action. Finally, he comes close again, and, after much mysterious searching, finds and cuts the string, which is invisible to everyone except himself. There is not a doubt amongst the onlookers as to his having really done this. Then once more the projecting of the Ainongara stones takes place, and crouching down over the sick man he places his mouth upon the afiected part and sucks, until at last the Ullinka is extracted, either in fragments or, very rarely, and only if he be a very distinguished medicine man, whole, and is shown to the wondering onlookers, the Atnongara stones returning, unseen, once more into his own body. When this is over, unless it is simply a case of senile decay-on the part of the patient, in which case the medicine man is too acute to take so much trouble, when he knows pretty well that there is no possibility of effecting a cure, the chances are strongly in favour of the latter, but if death ensues FIG. 120.--POSITION ASSUMED WHEN USING THE UNGAKURA POINTING APPARATUS. ARUNTA TRIBE. FIG. 121.--POSITION ASSUMED WHEN POINTING THE IRNA.

       "  \"To forestall possible conflict between rival interests in the same menoa , the individual Iban indicates the area which he wishes to use, and in recognition of spirit rights, not by way of purchase, he makes an offering to the spirit(s), who may, or may not, already consider this their territory. The account of Pulang Gana provides the basis in myth. Sacrificial offerings are invariably made at all times in which the Iban stake a claim to the use of land, whether for a short or long term purpose. Success of the undertaking implies that the arrangement has been satisfactory to all parties. When, however, events occur which are undesirable--bad harvests, sickness or death--it is assumed that something has proved un-acceptable to the spirits who then express their dissatisfaction by the calamities which they have the influence to inflict. A calamity is something which in the perfect and natural order of events does not occur: serious or chronic sickness, a wound which refuses to heal, or death in early or middle age (death in old age when there are children and grandchildren to uphold the bilek' s existence is considered natural). The behaviour of the spirits is essentially the same, when they effect calamities of this nature, as that which is expected among men when one man has infringed the rights of another, territorially or otherwise. In such circumstances there are two conceivable courses of remedial action. In milder cases it may be possible to satisfy the spirits with further offerings and sacrifices, but when the consequences are really serious or continue to recur, the only solution is to abandon the farm, longhouse, or project which has disturbed the menoa rights or interests of another party.\",\n",

Her husband appealed to me to drive away the god or his wife's delusion. The Rev. John Hunt was staying with me at the time and we went together to the dwelling of the woman, he armed with a large dose of Epsom salts, and I with a bottle of spirits of hartshorn. On our arrival we found the house filled with people, and the woman on her back in the midst, shouting lustily, ‘Let me alone, that I may return!’ The excitement was very great, but the shouting was considerably checked by the sudden application of hartshorn to her nose. When a light was brought we discovered that our patient was by no means a Venus, which led Mr. Hunt to observe, with dry gravity, ‘Truly she is a beauty: what a fancy the god must have who can desire her!’ A burst of laughter from the spectators, in which the husband outlaughed the whole, followed this remark. The treatment was most successful. The woman's pride was so strong that she at once sat up, assuring us that the god had gone away, and that she needed no more medicine.” 59 Thomas Williams and J.

       "  'Both these statements are incorrect. They were, perhaps, based on a misinterpretation. The Kabaka led the nation in supporting the gods and supplied them lavishly with gifts of tribute, but he did not control them or their cult, as some kings painfully learned. The Kabaka’s obligatory gifts to the gods indicate a relation of asymmetrical exchange (cf. Kenny 1988: 604). Upon accession, the Kabaka rebuilt the lubaale temples and presented the gods with large endowments of women, slaves, cattle, goats, and cowrie shells in multiples of the sacred number nine. The gods, in turn, exhorted the new king to “always love the gods” and gave him their blessing (Kaggwa [1907] 1934: 21). Every year, the Kabaka made new presentations to the gods to secure those blessings. He also gave a large number of human victims to the war god Kibuuka whenever Kibuuka’s temple was rebuilt. While responsible for the upkeep of the country’s major shrines, the Kabakas never oversaw the worship of the lubaale or governed the priests. On the contrary, when the Kabakas refused to take priestly advice and proceeded to kill the priests and loot their temples, the chronicles say that the lubaale were quick to take revenge. They set illnesses and other afflictions upon the Kabakas in order to put them in their place. In the nineteenth century, the priests of Mukasa regarded Mutesa I as their “son-in-law” (Roscoe 1911: 298), even their “slave” (Ashe 1895: 102n.), a relationship that indicated his subordinate status. The chronicles also report that Mukasa’s priests generally succeeded in forcing Mutesa I to do their will. To be sure, Mutesa’s father, Ssuuna II, is said to have boasted that he was the lubaale on earth because he could with impunity plunder the temples of the lubaale of the sky (Roscoe and Kaggwa 1906: 50; Burton [1860] 1961 II: 191). But even the powerful Ssuuna was unable to force the gods to do his bidding. The dynastic accounts say that Ssuuna was struck by lightning sent by lubaale Kiwanuka because he mistreated one of Kiwanuka’s priests (Kaggwa [1901] 1971: 119). Ssuuna is also said to have died of smallpox because he disobeyed the warnings of the priest of the war god Nnende (Nsimbi 1956b: 134). When Mutesa was ill in 1879, the priest of Mukasa attributed the malady to Mutesa’s political ambition, which offended Mukasa. Mutesa was thus forced to return the powerful chieftainship of the Mugema to its rightful possessors, the Vervet Monkey clan (Rowe 1967: 154-56; Kaggwa [1901] 1971: 176). As Roscoe himself noted, the temple priesthoods were appointed by the clan heads ( Bataka ), and although it was necessary for the king to ratify priestly appointments, the priesthoods tended to support clan interests (Wright 1971: 4). Even though the king might summon the priest of the war god Kibuuka to the capital, the god could refuse to let him go and the priest would stay at home (Kaggwa [1907] 1934: 222). Kaggwa also notes that Kibuuka was treated like a Kabaka, and his seat was called Nnamulondo, which was the name of the king’s enthronement stool. It was pointed out to me that ever since Tebandeke, the eighteenth Kabaka, who became a priest of Mukasa while on the throne, there was an institutional incompatibility between the Kabakaship and the priests, and the two could never be combined (cf. Kaggwa [1901] 1971: 56-59).',\n",

Coming before him, the Basese said: “When we give you our medicine, you must be washed on a mound.” When Kyabaggu heard this, he told Kabinuli the prime minister to instruct the people to build a mound and wash the king. After being washed for a few days, he recovered and he strictly forbade them ever to let loose the ghost which they had already captured. The mound upon which the king used to be washed was called Nkokompanga and it is still found in the capital of Nabulagala, near the prime minister’s enclosure.',\n",

A small hole is made in the ball with an awl, and it is pushed inside the tooth with the hole turned inwards (U.). 8) A good method when the ache is setting in is to bite a piece of birchwood until the pain disappears; this method is also used by aged Lapps to refasten their falling teeth (I. reind.-L. and U.). 9) A piece of red broadcloth is placed on the tooth and bitten for a while (I. reind. and fisher-L.). 10) The Kolt-Lapps sometimes place a piece of smoldering tinder on the cheek, by the aching tooth. 1 PAULAHARJU, Kolttain mailta, p. 174.

Hot ashes inside a woolen stocking or mitten are also applied (E.). 14) The hot water of boiled, wild rosemary is poured into a bowl and the patient keeps his head over the bowl, covered with a cloth (K.). 15) A frog is wrapped in a thin piece of cloth and kept on the cheek until it dies (I. reind.-L.).

In such a primitive society as that of the Andamans one of the most powerful means of maintaining the cohesion of the society and of enforcing that conformity to custom and tradition without which social life is impossible, is the recognition by the individual that for his security and well-being he depends entirely upon the society. Now for the Andaman Islander the society is not sufficiently concrete and particular to act as the object of such a sentiment, and he therefore feels his dependence upon the society not directly but in a number of indirect ways. The particular way with which we are now concerned is that the individual experiences this feeling of dependence towards every important possession of the society, towards every object which for the society has constant and important uses.',\n",

They do not know of the existence of pathogenic germs or of the chemical-biological action of the organism and the poisons that act upon it. Their logical mind, on the other hand, demands an explanation for the facts, it is certain that the effects demand a proportional cause. As the obvious forces of nature exist, they admit that there are, moreover, occult forces capable of producing the most varied and strange phenomena. Nor can the meteorological and astronomical phenomena fail to impress them. The Indian, besides, is a convinced animist, as we shall see later.

Like many among the civilized, they believe in witchcraft, evil eye, charms, enchantment, voodoo. A consequence of this opinion about the sicknesses will be no hygiene or preventive measures at all, hence the spread, for example, of malaria, grippe, tuberculosis, etc., as is reported for various occasions and places. ). That is, the sicknesses are caused by the malevolent spirit of the men who, by envying (one of the weak points of the forestdweller’s psyche) their fellow men, endeavor to do them some harm. For that, they can use the most varied objects turned malefic by magic: a lock of hair, a piece of cloth, wood, stone, metal, bone, thorn, very commonly a cigar butt ( 13 . Every time that, upon digging in a spot, a cigar butt is found, the Indian immediately thinks that it is a matter of a malefice. ), and even the mere thought.

       "  \"Aguardiente is illness-producing either directly because of its substance, or symbolically because it is one of the media by means of which a witch causes his victim to ingest poisonous substances. In turn, the drinking of aguardiente is interpreted as a disease process to the extent that individuals take “medicine” to reduce the number of occasions upon which they drink. The text citations which have been inserted above are suggestive of these points. By way of summing up this section, I would like to offer a less easily verifiable interpretation which provides still further context in terms of which the reader can think about the drinking performances in Aguacatenango. The first simple set of observations is as follows: Men drink and women don't. Some men drink more than others but all men must drink some. Some men would prefer to drink less than they do. Drinking settings for some men, especially under the informal drinking rules, are settings in which some considerable hostility is expressed. Suppose we take the case of the man who wishes to drink less. He can achieve this end in the short run by either drinking more or not drinking at all. He knows that he will not be able to completely terminate his drinking performances (the ceremonial drinking performances) until he is an old man. Ceremonial drinking performances are required of all men. He can, however, reduce the number of informal drinking performances. If a man wants to reduce the number of informal drinking performances, then, he can do so by increasing the average length of any particular informal drinking performance. Increasing the length of an informal drinking performance increases the probability that the individual will become ill (as well as exhaust all his resources, anger the members of his household, and so on). Upon the next occasion when some individual invites him to start an informal drinking performance, he can respond by saying, “I am afraid to start an informal drinking performance with you since my style of informal drinking performance results for me in severe illness, alienates my family, causes economic catastrophe to my household.” The person inviting must allow that this is true, in view of the fact that he observed ego engaging in such extended performances within the past year, say. On the other hand, an individual can stop engaging in informal drinking performances by reporting that he has taken medicine for drinking, which medicine will cause his death if he drinks. It is not unusual for a man to take medicine and then become very sick by way of telling the community that it was real medicine with strong disease producing effects. If a man goes on drinking in the informal drinking after he has taken the medicine, it is proof that the medicine did not have the desired effect. The common feature of either response to the desire to reduce amount of drinking: increasing the length of the informal drinking performances or taking medicine puts the individual in that context which allows him to say, “If I drink I will die.” We believe that it is only by citing such severe effects as this that an individual can, over the long run, control his response to the invitation to drink. 1 In the short run, a man can avoid any particular, highly probable informal drinking performance by leaving the field, as was suggested above. That is, by knowing which days informal drinking performances are more likely to occur on than other days (the ten day time zone around some major fiesta, or Sundays, for example), he can arrange to be “away on business.”\",\n",

Persons bitten by a mad wolf generally went mad, too. They trembled and their limbs jerked, they made their jaws work and foamed at the mouth, often trying to bite other people. When any one acted in this way, his relations tied him hand and foot with ropes, and, having killed a buffalo, they rolled him up in the green hide, and then built a fire on and around him, leaving him in the fire until the hide began to dry and burn.

He was a bandit who took whatever he wanted.” Several people in Ch'i-pei, on the other side of San-hsia town, claim that one of their neighbors used a potion to make her husband impotent (because she was a sim-pua and didn't like her husband), and that as a result the gods punished her with a protracted illness. Any particularly striking death is likely to be interpreted as supernaturally administered punishment. One day Hsia-ch'i-chou was struck by an unusually violent electrical storm. As one villager described it to me six years later, “There was lightning everywhere. The rice stalks in the kitchen looked like they were about to burn.” Ong Hok-hin, returning from his fields, stopped to rest in front of the village store. “After watching the storm for a while, he said, ‘I wonder who the lightning will kill today.’ Then he got up and walked toward home. He was killed just as he was entering his house.” Although Ong Hok-hin was generally thought of as a man of good character, the manner of his death was taken as evidence of some unsuspected crime. “He always seemed to be a good man, but he must have done something very bad that no one knew about or the gods wouldn't have punished him that way.” A more sophisticated informant made the same point about a relative who had been killed by a truck, adding that “this is the reason people say it is better to die of an illness than to die a violent death.”\",\n",

They also used a ki o-á and a tâng-ki to consult at various times with King Guo, Marshal Shieh, and the Third Prince. These three gods all agreed on a supernatural explanation of the child's illness. The boy's father was in Japan at the time of the illness, but it was he who was held responsible for the problem. The father's father (the boy's grandfather) had died before the boy's grandmother, and this lady had married again into another family. She had apparently lived happily with her new husband and eventually died in the bosom of her second family. Some time after the old lady's death, the sick boy's father built a new house and equipped it handsomely. He decided it was rather awkward not to have his mother's ancestral table beside his father's on the new family altar, however, so he negotiated with the old lady's second family and ultimately received permission to take the table home to worship at least temporarily.\",\n",
       "  'The circumcision of boys is performed at about the age of puberty. The wound is healed with red pepper crushed in milk or by the smoke of a wood fire. The operation serves as a test of the bravery of the future warrior; it is followed by a period of seclusion. The excision of girls may take place a few days after birth or at about the age of two or three or about the age of seven. It is done by women. One fact is to be noted here, for it is characteristic: excision is followed by what has inaccurately been called “stitching.” After the clitoris has been cut off, the two sides of the organ are made raw and joined with actual hooks made of thorns. Only a very small opening is left. Gum is spread upon the wound to facilitate the healing process, and the flesh soon grows together. It is established that the women are not “stitched,” but rather “welded.” This operation, which is extremely painful, is followed at the time of marriage by a reopening which is no less painful. Without hesitation, one may regard this quite simply as an attempt to guarantee virginity in the most extreme manner possible and with complete disregard for the consequences of such precautions (fatal accidents, absence of normal muscular reactions at childbirth which force the midwife to enlarge the opening with a dagger, etc.).',\n",

Similarly, an Inari-Lapp who lived nearby always fell ill when the Kolt-Lapps came, until he happened to be told that he could preserve his health if he would put a piece of steel under his doorsill.

Some of them appear in human shape; they chat and have a meal in the master's hut, although no food is consumed. If the sorcerer treats his evil spirits badly, they may even attack him. When the sorcerer dies they are freed, unless he has had time to leave them to someone else.

A particular kind of sorcery was the practice of enchanting ( lommad ), especially into a heavy sleep, during which the sorcerer could subject the other person to whatever he wanted. The leaders of the enemies ( t s udd e ) were, for example, able to enchant people so that they were unable to put up opposition. While in a trance the sorcerer would sing in a humming voice ( k ihkkvd , original meaning = “to hiss, to imitate the call of a wood grouse at mating time”).\",\n",

       "  'Another rite de passage of critical importance takes place on the occasion of a woman’s first childbirth. After the Muslim naming ceremony on the seventh day, the mother returns to her parents’ home with her baby, and remains there for a period of six months or longer, during which she performs the prescribed post-natal ablutions daily for five months. This custom, known as bangwalle, has many different variations, but its performance for the first birth is normative. On completion of bangwalle the mother returns to her husband’s compound loaded with gifts from her kin, and for the first time in her husband’s home will suckle her infant without any pressure or compulsion being necessary. But throughout their lives, a parent of either sex and the first-born child observe a rigorous avoidance-relation, which is hardly relaxed even in private and when the child is fully grown. As the very full acount in the text illustrates (pp. 1 sqq.), social sanctions compel conformity to this behaviour, both during the period of ablutions and thereafter. The entire complex is best understood as a rite de passage, marking the transition in status to parenthood and full social maturity, and the lifelong avoidance-relation, which is extended by Fulani to the second and third child, and by Hausa-speaking Habe and Fulani to the next-born in greater or less degree, if the first child dies in infancy, gives a permanent expression to this new status. Similarly the post-natal ablutions, which are carried out for successive births, are probably best understood as extensions of ritual activity on the first childbirth rather than as measures of preventive hygiene (which the Hausa declare them to be), since such ablutions are not performed for stillbirths or miscarriages, and may be brought to an early conclusion if the mother is unable to bear the washing with nearly boiling water; if this happens, alternative ‘medicines’, herbal and Islamic, are employed.',\n",
       "  'It is impossible for the Christian races to understand, or estimate the powerful influence, which the “medicine” beliefs have for ages exerted upon the Indian character and tribal life. It being their universal belief that illness of the body signified possession by an evil spirit, their methods of healing, in common with those of all savage tribes, naturally took the form of incantation and occult ceremonies for exorcising it. No doubt the title of “medicine,” by which their doctors were known in our early chronicles of the Indians, had its origin in this manner with the early French colonists. By a natural transition it passed into that of “medicine men,” with English speaking people. A “medicine man” is believed to control the weather, to heal the sick and exorcise evil spirits by means of incantations and magic arts. He is really more of a magician than a medical doctor, although he constantly assumes the functions of the latter. His vocation is to instruct and guide in the avoidance of acts that are “bad medicine” and therefore unlucky, and in the use of the best means for propitiating the Evil Power, because of unlucky acts already committed. When an Indian is “making medicine,” he is performing mysterious ceremonies, or using other approved means for controlling the supernatural powers and averting the malevolence of the evil spirits. Some authorities have understood the word as meaning “mystery,” and the medicine man as “mystery man.” But this is not an adequate expression. While there is no corresponding word in the English language to express the equivalent of the Indian idea, the phrase “supernatural power” is probably the nearest equivalent to the word “medicine,” in its common Indian use.',\n",

In Hsin-chu itself, this event is regarded as a pho-to (exorcism) and focuses on the grave containing the bones of those Hakka slain in their efforts to support imperial troops against the forces of the rebel Lin Shuang-wen in 1786-88 (Michael Moser, personal communication). For example, when I asked why a raw pig and raw fowl were offered to Co Su Kong, who is known to be a vegetarian, I was often told that Co Su Kong accepts the raw meat, cooks it, and distributes it to the hungry ghosts. One man said that the raw fowl is for the hungry ghosts and that the Ti Kong is for the “mountain spirits” who are also the soldiers of Co Su Kong. (Soldiers of gods are kui in character and have to be bought off frequently with offerings lest they cause sickness and trouble.) When I asked one man why this Thai Ti Kong is called a pai-pai if ghosts are involved, he said “Actually people do not ‘ pai-pai ’ [pay respect]; they ‘ ce ’ [placate].

       "  'The three festive times in Palomino and Noavaka, March, September, and November-December, are sharply distinguished, but have no special names. All are called nuvakala, because there is dancing with the feather adornment of the birds ( nuva ), or kuiza (dance), while the church festivals are called pita, pitei, from the Spanish pitar (to pipe), or suziuan, from suzú (the stranger). The 110 March festival is to get from the sun protection against sickness for the coming rainy season and in addition a brief continuation of the dry season in order to finish the field work. It is therefore concerned exclusively with health, whereas that occurs only incidentally in connection with the two other festivals ( 40, 62, 77 ). In the September festival there is expressed the endeavor to call forth rain or to lessen its abundance, to moderate the winds, to keep all kinds of animals away from the crops, and in every way to care for the thriving of the crops. The December festival is concerned with the restoration of the dry season, with the harvest itself, and with all the tasks of the dry season, such as housebuilding and the making of pots. Common to all the festivals, besides the above-mentioned concern for health, are: at the beginning, songs for the birds whose feathers are worn at festivals ( 49 to 51 ); occasional songs for the animals who make up the festive foods ( 52 to 55, 63 ); at the end, songs for the eating of salt ( 29, 30, 64, 65 ), and after that the women’s dances, which are almost exclusively directed against animals that pursue the chickens ( 1 . The fox song ( 42 )is also sung at the end. ) or damage the crops ( 68 to 74 ). Some of these, for instance, the dance of the lizard ( 75 ) and of the pasaroyo /Sp. pasarríos, “lizard, basilisk”/ ( 76, are also performed at church festivals, but then without the feather adornment. At these feasts of the saints the women are said to dance in a circle, without holding on to one another, while one who has a little drum hanging down and beats it with two sticks moves in the middle. The flute is not blown in connection with this. The salt dance too is actually a dance of the women, that is, originally of the girls trained in the temple, like the novices, as their future wives. Such general songs and dances, however, are not absolutely necessary. Only the salt dance seems never to be omitted.',\n",
       "  \"Infanticide is undoubtedly practised, but, except on rare occasions, the child is killed immediately on birth, and then only when the mother is, or thinks she is, unable to rear it, owing to there being a young child whom she is still feeding, and with them suckling is continued for it may be several years. They believe that the spirit part of the child goes back at once to the particular spot from whence it came, and can be born again at some subsequent time even of the same woman. Twins, which are of extremely rare occurrence, are usually killed immediately as something which is unnatural; but there is no ill-treatment of the mother, who is not thought any the less of. We cannot find out what, exactly, lies at the root of this dislike of twins in the case of the Arunta and other tribes. Possibly it is to be explained on the simple ground that the parent feels a not altogether unrighteous anger that two spirit individuals should think of entering the body of the woman at one and the same time, when they know well that the mother could not possibly rear them both, added to which the advent of twins is a very infrequent event, and the native always has a dread of anything which appears strange and out of the common. In connection with this it may be noted that on the very rare occasions on which the child is born at a very premature stage as the result of an accident, nothing will persuade them that it is an undeveloped human being; they are perfectly convinced that it is the young of some other animal, such as a kangaroo, which has by mistake got inside the woman. 1 Sterility is of frequent occurrence at the present day amongst the native women. The greatest fertility is amongst the strong stout women, the thin and weaker ones rarely having children. Possibly sterility in many cases is associated with injury received during the initiation rite of Ariltakuma. The natives believe that it may be brought about by a girl in her youth playfully or thoughtlessly tying on a man's hair waist-band. The latter so used, if only for a moment or two, has the effect of cramping her internal organs and making them incapable of the necessary expansion, and this is the most frequent explanation of sterility given by the natives.\",\n",

In one there was the conventional white rag tied to a pole leaning against the wall, and in the other a tattered green banner hanging from a flagpole whose ornament was a flat metal hand, the “Hand of Fatima” previously mentioned. Some graves had a large quantity of broken blue porcelain scattered over them, and it was said that this custom was followed if the deceased was a young man, both to indicate the grave as such and to avert further misfortune. There are indications, however, that breaking porcelain at death is a cultural trait of some antiquity, and further study might prove it an interesting index of historical connection.

       "  \"This at least seems to be the traditional form, and it is the form of spirit marriage described by Li (1968) on the basis of his fieldwork in Changhua. In Bao-an and the surrounding area spirit marriage occurs differently. The ghost seldom appears in a dream to her parents to demand a husband. In the cases with which I am familiar she strikes misfortune upon her natal family or the families of her married sisters. This usually takes the form of sickness of one or more family members. When the sickness is not cured by ordinary means, the family turns to divination and learns of the plight of the ghost through a séance. Usually several sessions are held with different gods before a marriage is finally agreed to by the living. The most common oracle to which problems of spirit marriage are put is the female medium of a so-called Little God 6 The term “little god” is used to refer to the divinized spirits of local people, whose oracles are consulted primarily by women for information on the rearing of children and other of the family's affairs that are entirely or largely under the government of women. We shall have more to say of them later on. in Chiali. This particular god's tâng-ki specializes in spirit marriages and has a stock of equipment for their performance which can be rented by the day. Therefore, in deciding to consult the Little God, an individual or a family is fairly clearly anticipating a spirit marriage, and it will be one of my assumptions in what follows that a spirit marriage is initiated by the family involved.\",\n",

In its place he casts “a vessel full of illnesses,” especially fevers, and soon the surroundings become infested with mosquitoes; the inhabitants of the maloca fall ill or are forced to leave their dwellings. The natural explanation of this phenomenon that, according to talk, is frequent enough is this: sometimes the fish that live in the large pools of the rapids, near the landings, migrate and abandon a certain sector of the river. As soon as this happens, the place becomes almost uninhabitable due to the great quantity of mosquitoes whose increase is caused by the absence of the fish that previously fed on the larvae of these insects. However, as these places are also natural camp sites, many mosquitoes become contaminated with malaria causing these sites to be very unhealthy. 3 . Near Piramirí (now Teresita) on the Papurí River there is a stretch of rocky ground called Vaí-mahsë toré .

       "  \"There are two interpretations of the healthy appearance of Maasai. The popular view is to note the excellence of their diet and way of life by normal African standards (Orr and Gilks 1931). The more sombre view is to accept that only the most robust children have a chance of survival and natural selection is a major factor in the level of health (Merker 1904:334). The true balance between these is hard to assess. The Matapato are reluctant to discuss family tragedies and they dispose of dead children unobtrusively. The general absence of congenital disabilities inevitably raises questions regarding the fate of defective babies. 3 The term en-tomononi refers most commonly to a young mother whose hair reveals her ritual state, but it also applies to certain other ritualised roles including the infant itself. Apart from emphasising the weakness of her condition, informants offered no derivation of this term. In the related language Bari, however, a phonetically similar term, tomunyan , is translated as ’tenderness, feebleness, weakness’ (Spagnolo 1960:300). In its male form, ol-tomononi may refer to a generally propitious elder with children, who is especially suitable for a prominent role in any ceremony. It is held that any deformity could indicate some past sin dogging either parent, but God condoned this birth and God alone should choose the moment of death. As children are progressively exposed to the outside world, those that are maladapted are less likely to survive, but still a few may do so and even live to raise healthy families of their own. It is God's will, they say.\",\n",

The latter, putting his hand into the patient's mouth, scrapes the pharyngeal tonsils with the nail of his index finger, or with a small knife, so strongly that they bleed profusely. A rather large number of people whom I questioned about the success of the cure asserted that they always could count on certain recovery. Two of my boys, Masai youths about 11 to 12 years old, fell ill with the above symptoms. In spite of careful symptomatic treatment, their recovery of strength was so unsatisfactory that, upon their request, I gave them permission to go to a nearby livestock-kraal in the steppe for relief.

The conflict was exemplified in his parting seance (not an unusual Tikopia custom) in which in his trance state the resistant and anxious elements of his mind were able to come to the surface and express themselves freely. They took the form of spirit objections to the man's desertion of his traditional faith. Restatement of his conviction of the rightness of his decision emerged in final spirit statements that they agreed to depart from him and come to him no more.

There is the very strongest possible case for a ship carrying an infection of any kind not to touch at the island. The Tikopia, ignorant of the germ theory of disease, believe that an epidemic is due to the malignancy of those in control of the vessel. They associate it also to some extent with the blowing of the ship's whistle, so that the captain of the Southern Cross , at their request, abstained from the usual practice when weighing anchor. The onset and disappearance of a wave of common colds which followed the visit of the ship when I was set down on the island was a perfect illustration of the spread of an infection.

Thunder is ilapa , a god throwing balls ( ilapaña ) at the earth. Lightning is exuexu , hurled from tata santiagun oraqapa , “Father Santiago's sling.” There is a confusion in the minds of the modern Aymara between the ancient sky-god Viracocha, the thunder-god Thunupa, the horseman god of the Spanish (Santiago), and the bearded white men with loudly explosive arquebuses of colonial times. If a person is struck by lightning and still lives, he is regarded as particularly favored by the god ( tatilun munatau ). ( See p. 170.)

       "  'The Kógi, of course, recognize that a given animal will preferentially eat a certain diet and will never eat anything that might harm him. It seems that a good part of the tensions which at present characterize the marital situation is due to such considerations. Frequently, under present conditions, an individual marries any woman, regardless of her Dáke, and generally both parties are ignorant of the details of the Túxe system, knowing only that they belong to a certain totem. Although the Máma sometimes disapproves of such a marriage, he allows it; and thus frequently an individual marries a woman who, according to the ancient rules, is not suitable for him. If then any misfortune occurs in the family, such as illness, bad crops, or infant mortality, the Máma is the first to blame the husband and to tell him 191 that the misfortune occurred because he married a prohibited woman. When the man thus realizes that his “food” was not suitable for him and that, as a jaguar, he had “eaten” a snake, he thus immediately rationalizes the illness, infant mortality, or the loss of fertility of his cultivated lands in terms of a dangerous indigestion which threw his marriage completely out of balance and exposed it to very severe supernatural punishments. Let it be said that, in all the complex functioning of the Túxe and Dáke, the totemic idea is the one that has been most strongly maintained among the Kógi, and in any marriage both parties know very well to what totems they belong, although they may know nothing else about additional rules, origins, or attributes.',\n",

       "  '“The devil is death”; “After death we are all devils”; “Sicknesses are the dead.” These three phrases of the Kogi show very clearly what the concept of Heiséi, Death, means to them. Of course, the word “devil” does not exist in their language, but heiséi -- dead person or death -- is always translated in this way, since it is the force opposed to the principle of the good, of life. Heiséi ( 3 . The etymology of the word is unknown to us. Preuss writes: hiséi . ) is spoken of as a collectivity, just as sometimes “the Mother” and “the Mothers” are confused; and this concept includes all the dead, that is to say, all of the ancestors of the tribe who are not expressly designated as immortals such as the Fathers, Mothers, or Masters. Heiséi is a man, and they imagine him with “the face of a tigre.” In fact, the mask which represents him has a long muzzle and great projecting teeth, and during the dance which is performed with it the movements and growls of this wild animal are imitated. Heiséi is the Master of Sickness and it is he who sends it to earth to punish those persons who have committed offenses or who have been negligent about the rites and offerings. Just like the Mother, Heiséi is omnipresent, but his symbols are male symbols: the snake, the arrow, the crab ( 4 . The crab is a “worm.” The big blue crabs of the coast are called heiséi husso -- crab of death. ). The mast of Heiséi shows a snake coiled around the face. The color of Death is blue, and the sky is blue because “the dead live there” ( 5 . It is not always very clear where the dead live, in the sky or in the snow. Cf. “Religion, The Beyond.” ). Archeological sites are places where “Death lives” ( 6 . Cf. “Economy, the System of Horticulture” /see 1: Reichel-Dolmatoff in this file/. Ancient osseous remains are called heiséinita . ), and archeological objects are “things of the dead,” and therefore full of contagion and sickness. Such objects must be reburied or handed over to the Máma . Heiséi has a marked sexual character ( 7 . Perhaps the name heiséi is related to sé sei -- penis. ) and controls the sexual life, especially of the men. 91 In fact, he is sometimes designated as Father of Homosexuality. The Kogi believe that there is almost no place on the surface of the earth where there has not been cohabitation some time, that is to say, where human beings who today are heiséi have not cohabited. The earth is imagined to be literally impregnated with the sperm of the dead, and contact between this and the sperm of the living “opens a door” through which sickness may enter the land. If a person performs the sexual act again in one place, Heiséi “will do harm” to the sexuality of the man, will send sicknesses to him, and will cause the death of the children. These sites are designated as “traps” (katú) into which the sperm falls; and above all graveyards or places where it is believed that dead persons are buried are called this ( 8 . Compare with this concept of “trap” the uterine symbolism which burial has. Cf. “Life Cycle; Death and Burial.” ). Since the land itself is a female element and symbolizes the Mother, coitus on this land always implies the danger of incest, and Heiséi is closely related to the incestuous instinct. The ritual of coitus is considered essentially a means of defense to counteract the malign influence of Heiséi and to avoid this incest.',\n",

       "  \"Besides supernatural interpretations of illness, such as a disturbance made by the devil or an ancestor's spirit, loss of soul, violation of taboo, etc., which are related to ancient animism and Taoism, a dang-gi's interpretation is frequently influenced by traditional herbal medicine. Thus, the concept of yin and yang disharmony of humors, as well as other medical terms and concepts, are utilized by a dang-gi in his practice. As for treatment, besides the supernatural methods of keeping taboo, praying, the use of charm-paper and exorcism, herbal medicine is also prescribed by many dang-gi .\",\n",

       "  \"Finally, the children differ from adults in their susceptibility to supernatural hazards. A great deal of Yaanomamo sorcery and mythological references to harmful magic focuses on children as the target of malevolence. Yanomamö shamans are constantly sending evil spirits ( Hekura ) to enemy villages. There, they secretly attack and devour the vulnerable portion of the childrens' souls ( noreshi ), bringing about sickness and death These same shamans spend an equal amount of time warding off the dangerous spirits sent by their enemies. Children are vulnerable because their souls are not firmly established within their physical beings, and can wander out of the body almost at will. The most common way for a child's soul to escape is to leave by way of the mouth when the child cries. Thus, mothers are quick to hush a bawling baby in order to prevent its soul from escaping. The child's soul can be recovered by sweeping the ground in the vicinity where it most probably escaped, calling for it while sweeping the area with a particular kind of branch. I once helped gather up the soul of a sick child in this fashion, luring it back into the sick baby. One of the contributions I made, in addition to helping with the calling and sweeping, was a dose of medicine for the child's diarrhea. A consequence of this set of attitudes about the vulnerability of children is that much of the village's activity with respect to shamanism and curing is directed toward the children.\",\n",
       "  'Disappointed at the non-appearance of the caribou, my versatile “father” sought by other means to replenish our dwindling stock of meat. He visited the harbour, where I had noticed some bearded seals playing in the open water near shore. It was not difficult to shoot them, but to bring them to land was an extremely hazardous enterprise, since a thin sheet of ice covered the water for a distance of a hundred yards out from the shore. Any dead seals that remained afloat, buoyed up by thick layers of blubber, drifted gently against its outer edge. Ikpuck crawled cautiously toward them, testing the ice in front of him with his hunting-knife; then, attaching a long line to a carcass, he retreated a few yards and dragged it out of the water. This was the most perilous task of all, and more than once the ice creaked ominously under the strain; but salt-water ice is less brittle than freshwater, and he escaped with nothing worse than two badly frozen wrists. Out of six seals that flated he landed three, which provided enough blubber to last us a month, even if we kept the lamp burning five or six hours a day. He did not mention the freezing of his wrists, and we did not discover their condition until they turned completely black.',\n",

       "  'After half an hour’s visit I was led by the Hajj through the streets of Zayla ** Zayla, called Audal or Auzal by the Somal, is a town about the size of Suez, built for 3000 or 4000 inhabitants, and containing a dozen large whitewashed stone houses, and upwards of 200 Arish or thatched huts, each surrounded by a fence of wattle and matting. The situation is a low and level spit of sand, which high tides make almost an island. There is no harbour: a vessel of 250 tons cannot approach within a mile of the landing-place; the open roadstead is exposed to the terrible north wind, and when gales blow from the west and south, it is almost unapproachable. Every ebb leaves a sandy flat, extending half a mile seaward from the town; the reefy anchorage is difficult of entrance after sunset, and the coralline bottom renders wading painful. The shape of this once celebrated town is a tolerably regular parallelogram, of which the long sides run from east to west. The walls, without guns or embrasures, are built, like the houses, of coralline rubble and mud, in places dilapidated. There are five gates. The Bab el Sahil and the Bab el Jadd (a new postern) open upon the sea from the northern wall. At the Ashurbara, in the southern part of the enceinte, the Bedouins encamp, and above it the governor holds his Durbar. The Bab Abd el Kadir derives its name from a saint buried outside and eastward of the city, and the Bab el Saghir is pierced in the western wall. The public edifices are six mosques, including the Jami, or cathedral, for Friday prayer: these buildings have queer little crenelles on whitewashed walls, and a kind of elevated summer-house to represent the minaret. Near one of them are remains of a circular Turkish Munar, manifestly of modern construction. There is no Mahkamah or Kazi’s court: that dignitary transacts business at his own house, and the Festival prayers are recited near the Saint’s Tomb outside the eastern gate. The northeast angle of the town is occupied by a large graveyard with the usual deleterious consequences. The climate of Zayla is cooler than that of Aden, and, the site being open all around, it is not so unhealthy. Much spare room is enclosed by the town walls: evaporation and Nature’s scavengers act succedanea for sewerage. Zayla commands the adjacent harbour of Tajurrah, and is by position the northern port of Aussa (the ancient capital of Adel), of Harar, and of southern Abyssinia: the feuds of the rulers have, however, transferred the main trade to Berberah. It sends caravans northwards to the Dankali, and south-west-wards, through the Eesa and Gudabirsi tribes as far as Efat and Gurague. It is visited by Cafilas from Abyssinia, and the different races of Bedouins, extending from the hills to the seaboard. The exports are valuable—slaves, ivory, hides, honey, antelope horns, clarified butter, and gums: the coast abounds in sponge, coral, and small pearls, which Arab divers collect in the fair season. In the harbour I found about twenty native craft, large and small: of these, ten belonged to the governor. They trade with Berberah, Arabia, and Western India, and are navigated by “Rajput” or Hindu pilots. Provisions at Zayla are cheap; a family of six persons live well for about 30 l. per annum. The general food is mutton: a large sheep costs one dollar, a small one half the price; camels; meat, beef, and in winter kid, abound. Fish is rare, and fowls are not commonly eaten. Holcus, when dear, sells at forty pounds per dollar, at seventy pounds when cheap. It is usually levigated with slab and roller, and made into sour cakes. Some, however, prefer the Arab form “balilah,” boiled and mixed with ghee. Wheat and rice are imported: the price varies from forty to sixty pounds the Riyal or dollar. Of the former grain the people make a sweet cake called Sabaya, resembling the Fatirah of Egypt: a favourite dish also is “harisah”—flesh, rice flour, and boiled wheat, all finely pounded and mixed together. Milk is not procurable during the hot weather; after rain every house is full of it; the Bedouins bring it in skins and sell it for a nominal sum. Besides a large floating population, Zayla contains about 1500 souls. They are comparatively a fine race of people, and suffer from little but fever and an occasional ophthalmia. Their greatest hardship is the want of the pure element: the Hissi or well, is about four miles distant from the town, and all the pits within the walls supply brackish or bitter water, fit only for external use. This is probably the reason why vegetables are unknown, and why a horse, a mule, or even a dog, is not to be found in the place. to one of his substantial houses of coralline and mud plastered over with glaring whitewash. The ground floor is a kind of warehouse full of bales and boxes, scales and buyers. A flight of steep steps leads into a long room with shutters to exclude the light, floored with tamped earth, full of “evening flyers” * “Fid-mer,” or the evening flyer, is the Somali name for a bat. These little animals are not disturbed in houses, because they keep off flies and mosquitoes, the plagues of the Somali country. Flies abound in the very jungles wherever cows have been, and settle in swarms upon the traveller. Before the monsoon their bite is painful, especially that of the small green species; and there is a red variety called “Diksi as,” whose venom, according to the people, causes them to vomit. The latter abounds in Gulays and the hill ranges of the Berberah country: it is innocuous during the cold season. The mosquito bites bring on, according to the same authority, deadly fevers: the superstition probably arises from the fact that mosquitoes and fevers become formidable about the same time. , and destitute of furniture. Parallel to it are three smaller apartments; and above is a terraced roof, where they who fear not the dew and the land-breeze sleep. * Such a building at Zayla would cost at most 500 dollars. At Aden, 2000 rupees, or nearly double the sum, would be paid for a matted shed, which excludes neither sun, nor wind, nor rain. I found a room duly prepared; the ground was spread with mats, and cushions against the walls denoted the Divan: for me was placed a Kursi or cot, covered with fine Persian rugs and gaudy silk and satin pillows. The Hajj installed us with ceremony, and insisted, despite my remonstrances, upon occupying the floor whilst I sat on the raised seat.

T sierges-seävi (I. reind.-L.) is a beetle living in water, which has two white rings around its neck. If this insect is drunk with the water, it will grow and make the stomach swell, eating the intestines down until death ensues. The animal is expelled from the stomach by making the patient eat as much boiled fish as he can stand and then raw fish until it makes him vomit; the insect may come out along with the vomit. A lizard may enter through the mouth of a person sleeping outside, and similarly the eggs of a frog with the drinking water; they will grow in the stomach and may even croak from time to time, and finally they will bring about the person's death. 1 Compare QVIGSTAD, Lapp. Heilkunde, pp. 63-5; PAULAHARJU, Kolttain mailta, p. 174. -- The Lapps believe that every person carries inside himself a curled worm, which straightened out might be several meters long; they mean, of course, the tapeworm (I. reind.-L.).

A belief or sentiment which finds regular outlet in action is a very different thing from a belief which rarely or never influences conduct.

       "  \"It is instructive to compare these two versions of this origins tale. Both mingle the mundane and the marvellous. A woman must be impregnated to conceive, but her impregnator is a gecko-spirit-man. Children are born by the ordinary route, but they converse while being born, and one bursts out from his mother's head. Both versions make casual use of much Tikopia cultural furniture which logically could come only later in the scheme of things--a wooden bowl, a bark-cloth belt, an assembly to determine the man responsible for a woman's pregnancy. Both versions also provide a traditional referent for major sectors of the Tikopia social system. The tale foreshadows the existence of the four clans by using clan names in referring to the deities, and in one case by stating baldly that they produced the modern chiefs. The tale also draws attention to the social importance of primogeniture in Tikopia, which is emphasized by the device whereby Tafito gained primacy over Semoana who would otherwise have been his elder brother. Perhaps here also is an expression in fantasy of sibling hostility, resolved in the tale by the victory of a younger over the eldest brother, though this victory is achieved only at a price--his disease and death endowment. The tale accounts also for the special association of Fangarere clan and chief with epidemic disease. Attributing hurricanes and other natural afflictions to the untimely breach of the birth process by Tafito, the tale implies a requirement of order in nature. It says in effect that disorder in one natural process is likely to be followed by disorder in another. (As another statement put it, illness and death lie with Tafito. As he sprang from the head of his mother, in anger she called out to him that sickness and death should go with him. And Tafito was the major Fangarere god.) In its second part, the incident with Tikarau the usurper, the tale provides a basis for an understanding of the “totemic” ascription of certain major foodstuffs to clan control, with attendant ritual procedures. 7 Firth, 1930-1, b.\",\n",

These are used when there is an obstruction somewhere in the body so that the blood and ch'i (vital force) cannot flow freely through the body as they should. One informant compared the body to a plant: “A plant kept in a small pot will be small and poor because the roots are bound up and are not able to spread out. Another plant kept in a large pot will spread out its roots and be healthy. So if a person is healthy his body will be entirely unencumbered. If there is a fault or obstruction somewhere, blood and other things cannot get through and his health will be bad.” Swelling is often taken as a sign of an obstruction in the body caused by a collection of hông (wind) at the swollen spot. For example, the place where a bone is broken often swells because of an accumulation of hông . The remedy is to ingest or apply cold-and-clean substances that will disperse the hông, remove the obstruction and allow the blood and ch'i to flow freely again.\",\n",

       "  'In order to feel himself to be a representative of the sun, the demon Zugí-mask ( zugí uákai ) had to have a very strange train of thought. He boasts in front of the priest Sivalukukui that he would be the sun of all peoples ( salinga gúatsi mama ), for he would protect against sickness to the ends of the directions with small offering stones. If any sickness were to come, he would close off the path of the sickness with a fence. But Sivalukukui denies that he could be the sun for all peoples ( 77 ). He could not be this, adds Trinidad Noivita in explanation, for he only attended to warding off sickness, not everything else, for instance, the harvest. According to the laws of sound change, Zugí corresponds to nugi, shell-lime, which is enjoyed with coca leaves. Sugi, the gourd container for the lime, is seemingly the same word. When Híuika brought the shells ( nuksuzua ) ( 4 . The word nugi, lime, is in most of the designations for shells and snails. Cf. nuksei, nukuluva, nukuva . ) from the sea in order to burn them at home in the mountains, he let himself be led astray to sleep with them, for they were girls. -- Such forbidden cohabitation is, in the belief of the Kagaba, always the cause of sickness. -- The shells avenged themselves, and after they were burned, there began the fever heat which the white ( 5 . Or the red ones; cf. 6, 3 /omitted in the translation/. ) shells brought, while the green ones brought the chills of fever. “So Híuika brought all kinds of sickness... Previously... one had begun to bar the path of sickness. But they went out and came in behind Híuika, since they were human beings” ( 6 , 3 ff.). Therefore, in usual fashion, the task of the Zugí mask, as demon of the burned shell-lime, is to influence the “fever heat” of the sicknesses brought into the mountains by the shells as a result of the burning. He is therefore also a kind of fire-demon. Now since one of the main tasks of the sun demons is 79 to ward off sickness approaching from the cardinal points, the Zugí mask wishes to do the same and to represent himself as “the sun of all peoples,” whereupon Priest Sivalukukui rightly told him that he could not possibly be the sun for all peoples, clearly because he had only limited powers over sicknesses coming from the sea, quite apart from the other tasks of the sun.',\n",

One of these parts, the noreshi , is capable of leaving the body; when it does so, the person becomes ill and dies unless it (the noreshi ) returns. The noreshi are inherited patrilineally for males and matrilineally for females. Each human noreshi has an animal or bird counterpart whose life is coextensive and coterminous with that of the human to which it corresponds. Many of the noreshi are types of animals commonly taken by hunters. Thus, when the Yanomaö kill game animals, they believe they also kill the human being to whom that noreshi corresponds. 1 They are not concerned about killing their own noreshi , for humans and their noreshi animals live in complementary distribution. Hence, hunting in the eyes of the Yanomaö is behaving fiercely, for every noreshi animal killed also results in the death of some human, usually an enemy.',\n",

       " 'passage': ['Occasional offerings are made in innumerable places along roads where the genii loci live, where there is a cave, a rock of extraordinary shape, or a spring of water. Approximately in the middle of the road between two towns, two cultivated fields, two rivers, hills, or lakes, there is always a stone in the road, sometimes literally covered with these offerings made by those who walk along these paths. Often the small bundles of maize leaves do not contain anything but the alúna of the offering which the traveler made when he passed through the place. Near these places they sometimes pull up green leaves and touch their thighs with them for a moment in order to absorb the fatigue. Then the leaf is placed upon the rock, and with it all of the tiredness of the traveler. Little piles of natural stones from 1 to 15 pounds in weight were explained to us as offerings “in order not to get tired” or for the fertility of the plantings of coca, which must be deposited on the ancient cultivation terraces ( 35 . If a man plants coca without having the appropriate sewá or without making the prescribed offerings, his family will become sick and his children “will have toothache.” ).',\n",
       "  \"In the strictest sense of the word, kwák tan is the designation for feeling pain, suffering, being indisposed, being sick. But to our Selk'nam a neat separation of the physical from the psychic pain matters very little: all suffering, especially the latter, causes him an unpleasant psychic condition, and he designates predominantly this discomfort, being depressed, being indisposed psychically , with kwák tan or sickness. The more comprehensive term kwáke is more in general use. The latter, however, considered as effect, in the above association of thought 756 means the same as kwák tan . (25) Other Feuerland /Tierra del Fuego/ travelers emphasize this abstract distinction little or not at all. Cf. Beauvoir (b):48, 127 and Tonelli:116. The professional activity of a n quite generally is called ksó m en = extracting the kwáke from a suffering person or inflicting such on someone, sending out a nem or á hmen , etc. Kátmeten , kátme en has a limited meaning = the treatment of a sick person according to the customary procedure of the n , in order to remove the kwáke ; in a carried-over sense, now also the therapeutic procedure of a European physician, along with the dispensation of medicines. On the other hand, k pá en means the use of ordinary remedies for injuries, etc., such as anyone can do.\",\n",
       "  'The Anadendron paniculatum is a plant from which the Andamanese obtain a valuable fibre, which they use for their bow-strings, and for thread with which to make their arrows and harpoons. A number of magical properties are attributed to this plant. Rheumatism is supposed to be due to the “smell” of the plant getting into the system when the fibre is being prepared 1 In preparing the fibre, the skin or bark of the young shoots of the plant is torn off in strips and these are placed on the thigh and scraped with a Cyrena shell. . The “smell” of the green plant, or of the fibre until it has been thoroughly dried for some days, is believed to frighten away turtle. A man who has been preparing the fibre would not dream of joining a turtle-hunting expedition, for his presence in the canoe would be sufficient to drive away all the turtle. A turtle-hunting expedition would be a failure if a piece of the green creeper were in the canoe. A man who has been handling the plant may not cook turtle, for the meat would be “bad,” i.e., uneatable. The same thing would happen if turtle meat accidentally came in contact with a piece of the plant. All this applies only to the green creeper, and not to the fibre after it has been properly prepared and dried. The fibre itself is used for binding the heads of turtle-harpoons, so it is evidently regarded as harmless.',\n",

       "  \"It will have been noted that a decrease in the “magic” of production is associated to some extent with the provision of an alternative, in the form of generalized prayers by mission teachers. This provision of alternative is seen more clearly with the “magic” of protection. In traditional Tikopia ritual the “magic” of protection is epitomised especially by the wearing of an oiled leaf circlet, put round the neck of a person by a chief or ritual elder with a formula for health and welfare. This is still done in pagan circles, and has the sociological function of serving as a demonstration of a ritual relation, and up to a point, a political relation between the person so invested and the man of rank. Practising Christians do not normally have such investment. But a similar function for them is fulfilled by the wearing of the Cross. Both it and the leaf necklet are described by the same general term feao , a ritually protective token. A conversation I had with two Christian lads in 1952 will illustrate the point. The Ariki Taumako, one of the three pagan chiefs, was about to hold an investiture one morning. I asked the lads if the leaf circlet was effective, was it “correct”? They answered that it was -- “the blocking of anything foolish”, i. e. of maleficient influences. “Then why don't you two go and get your circlets?” I asked ironically. “The dark crowd” -- i. e. it's a pagan affair. “Have you got your own protection then?” “Yes! the necklet of the Church.” The Cross on a chain round the neck was their feao , their spiritual protection against physical ills. Such a Cross can be made by anyone, they said, from the appropriate materials -- copper and a white metal such as aluminium or stainless steel. When it is made it does not need to be taken to be blessed by the priest; it is simply hung on the neck. But when the person goes to bathe, or to excrete, it should not be taken, but hung up in the house. If it should be taken to such contaminated places, ill results would occur.\",\n",

This, however, did not yet involve the full incidence of the inexorable fate which is the present lot of man; for old age, bodily decay, and debility do not spell death to the natives. In order to understand the full cycle of their beliefs it is necessary to study the factors of illness, decay, and death. The native of the Trobriands is definitely an optimist in his attitude to health and illness. Strength, vigour, and bodily perfection are to him the natural status which can only be affected or upset by an accident or by a supernatural cause. Small accidents such as excessive fatigue, sunstroke, over-eating, or exposure may cause minor and temporary ailments. By a spear in battle, by poison, by a fall from a rock or a tree a man may be maimed or killed. Whether these accidents and others, such as drowning and the attack of a crocodile or a shark, are entirely free from sorcery is ever a debatable question to a native. But there is no doubt whatever to him that all serious and especially all fatal illnesses are due to various forms and agencies of witchcraft. The most prevalent of these is the ordinary sorcery practised by wizards, who can produce by their spells and rites a number of ailments covering well nigh the whole domain of ordinary pathology, with the exception of very rapid fulminating diseases and epidemics.',\n",

On such occasions, the semengat can become lost or ensnared by a malevolent spirit. Thus, ‘the most common diagnosis of sickness among the Iban is that some misfortune has befallen the soul; as Manang Bungai expressed it: “at the first trace of illness, the soul is already wandering abroad” ( Sepi kitai tabin , lelang semengat )’ (Freeman 1967:316).

       "  'The curious term anea pariki may now be examined to see why it is that a rite of celebrating the firstfruits of fishing should be called “evil things”.

The object of these medicines is to insure the neophyte against harm from the violent leaps characteristic of the bori dance. They are administered during the first three days of the ritual, while the initiate is in seclusion with the “father” or “mother of the boiling.” During this period he is also taught the songs sung under possession, and the drum rhythms by which the spirits are called or rhythms played on the gàraya, a stringed instrument used mainly at these bori rites.

The doors are of heavy timbers, swinging on iron hinges, and, lacking a metal lock, are bolted at night with a heavy wooden bar which is kept in place by a second plece above it on a pivot. The outer doorway may have a fuel lamp for night and in many cases is furnished with oharms designed to ward off the evil eye, a belief which will be discussed in a later section. These are oharacteristically a blue porcelain plate, embedded in the mud wall-surfacing, or a pair of old shoes hung on a nail. The popular reasoning behind the second device is that it indicates to a person with the eye that “your malevolent glance is as powerful as our pair of old shoes,” an explanation that probably has little to do with the origin of the custom. Whenever the construction of a house is completed, the new owner sacrifices an animal, a sheep or a goat, by cutting its throat before the door and smears some of the blood on the doorposts and the threshhold. Often he dips his hand in the blood, and applies it to the door, making by its imprint the so-called “Hand of Fatima” (referred, almost certainly ex post facto , to the daughter of the Prophet), a symbol found in almost all parts of the Middle East, particularly in amulet jewelry. The same sacrifice is applied to new additions to the house, and, in case a new storey has been built, the throat of the animal is slit over a window sill. It will be seen that When a bride enters her new home, an animal is similarly slaughtered before the threshhold and the maiden's sandal is dipped in its blood. It is an incredible breach of etiquette, if not criminal, to enter a house without announcing oneself, a usage which is supposed to have an origin in the life of the Prophet, and custom demands that the visitor knock and wait outside until ushered in.

One was the question of forces in the personality too strong to be completely inhibited by any external sanction and incapable of being organized by the personality itself. The Tikopia theory of madness continued to be in terms of the notion of spirit possession. But it was possession in a socially non-viable way; the belief that unnamed wandering spirits were responsible did not conflict with the view that the named kinrelated spirits had retired in dignified fashion to their dwelling places. The second problem concerned what may be rather loosely indicated as the psycho-somatic aspects of the illness. Previously these appeared to be catered for fairly effectively by the spirit medium performances; what then could take their place? The Tikopia answer here was clear--the power of prayer. The ‘laying on of hands’ of the Christian priest, and prayers said in church for the sick, seemed in 1966 so far to have met this need, at least in public estimation.',\n",
       "  'I have not been able to determine any other substance orally ingested by means of which illness can be sent to the drinker. This may be associated with the fact that the membership of the drinking group in Aguacatenango is least well defined and hence the one where enemies are most likely to be encountered. Likewise it is the one in which aggressive performances are most likely to occur. 1 This interpretation would have it that aguardiente becomes a physical medium by means of which the anger of the witch is transmitted to his target. Most aguardiente I have drunk has swirling hair in it; so foreign substance is not uncommon and thus available for potential interpretation. To restate the matter slightly, we may say: there is a language of aguardiente which depends upon the visual cues in examining the liquid. It is a one information bit language. The bit reads: If the aguardiente is clear when one is offered a drink, drink it and thank the drinker. If the aguardiente is “swirling-hairful,” and one is offered a drink, break the glass or bottle and beat the offerer up. One general performance the drink pourer engages in on most occasions I have observed is as follows: He pours the drink into the shot glass, then examines the liquid to see if it is clean or not. If it is not clean, he will attempt to clean it by picking out the foreign substance (sticks, leaves, hair, dirt, etc.). This cleaing response may be conditioned in part by the one bit language mentioned above. (See drinking performance of ayuntamiento where this has been mentioned before.)',\n",

As we waded through a swamp, a small bright spot shone between the reeds and low brush; we stood still. Involuntarily there flowed from the lips of all the men: “A kwáke ! ... If we only knew from where it comes and to which person it was sent by a n !” Afterwards I heard further: “Now and then a kwáke is seen in the evening as a brighter or dimmer spot of light.

       "  'In the evening occurred one of those picturesque features of the ritual on which the natives themselves love to dwell in narration -- Te Asunga One, The Scooping of the Sand. It is a frequent practice of the Tikopia in re-furbishing the graves of their ancestors to bring a basket or two of white coral sand from the beach and spread it on top to give the 1 1 [See p.p. 170-171, Cat.116 -- Analyst] place of burial a neat and cleanly appearance. In the case of the Kafika temple this has been elevated into a ritual procedure, surrounded with severe tapu. In the monsoon season a dozen women, of Kafika or married out of that clan, assembled at the time when the sun was low over the western hill crest and proceeded to Potu sa Kafika, where they each plaited a small basket from fresh coconut leaf. They then set out when the sun had disappeared behind the hills, going in single file along the beach path round the bluff of Fongo-te-Koro till they reached the level expanse of Namo. Arrived at Suakava, the canoe yard of the sacred vessel of the Ariki Tafua, they halted and spread out in line along the edge of the beach, where the low bank of coral boulders met the sand. Facing up towards the canoe shed they sat down in groups of three or four and scooped out several large holes with their hands. It is from this that the rite takes its name. The sand taken out was used to fill the baskets. While this was in progress no one approached them or called out to them nor did they chatter among themselves, save to pass the few necessary comments on their work. For a man, in particular, to have interfered with them would have been the gravest breach of religious etiquette; I received permission to observe the proceedings only on condition that I did not set foot on the canoe ground and made no attempt to talk with the women -- conditions which of course I kept. he would be certain, according to the natives, to have brought on himself death, or at the least severe illness. When the baskets were full the women rose all together and walked in single file up to the canoe shed, where they stood for a moment. A man of Kafika clan approached the leading girl in the line and silently handed her a large met, then retired without a word. She advanced to the canoe shed, laid down the met, and set her basket upon it, after which the other baskets were passed to her along the line and stacked in one by one. This was done deliberately without haste. Another mat was laid on top covering the heap, and the women then withdrew, as they came, in single file, and walked off the canoe ground. Then they sat down in a group and discussed where they would spend the night. They could elect to sleep together in a single house, or go each to her own dwelling. The decision was specifically stated by the men to be taken upon their personal preference. A reasonable interpretation seems to be that the traditional privilege of spending the night together undisturbed emphasises their exclusiveness, increases the amount of public attention given to them, and to some extent allows them an assertion of their female group independence.',\n",

The wound is then plugged up with various herbs, roots, etc., which are chiefly chosen for their styptic properties, and chopped up very fine.

It was not difficult to shoot them, but to bring them to land was an extremely hazardous enterprise, since a thin sheet of ice covered the water for a distance of a hundred yards out from the shore. Any dead seals that remained afloat, buoyed up by thick layers of blubber, drifted gently against its outer edge. Ikpuck crawled cautiously toward them, testing the ice in front of him with his hunting-knife; then, attaching a long line to a carcass, he retreated a few yards and dragged it out of the water. This was the most perilous task of all, and more than once the ice creaked ominously under the strain; but salt-water ice is less brittle than freshwater, and he escaped with nothing worse than two badly frozen wrists. Out of six seals that flated he landed three, which provided enough blubber to last us a month, even if we kept the lamp burning five or six hours a day.

       "  \"As the time for moving from their temporary villages to the eunoto site draws near, the manyat are joined by non-manyata moran and they migrate as a whole age-group. The apprehensiveness of sorcery surrounding this move helps to build up a sense of occasion. The eunoto site itself is kept secret so that it cannot be tampered with beforehand. A protective line of chalky ‘medicine’ provided by the Prophet is traced on every forehead from ear to ear for the move. There is also a false start to divert misfortune from the migration proper that follows. This is a theme that is repeated later that day with the installation of the ritual leader, for he too is thought to divert misfortune from his age mates who follow him to elderhood. This concern with threats from sinister forces coincides with the transformation that the age-group of moran undergo through eunoto . It marks an implicit shift in the distribution of power with age more generally. The juxtaposition of large numbers of older men and younger men sharply differentiated by age highlights their differences. The maturation of the moran is a fact of life that arouses ambivalence, clearly expressed in Episode 2 and other incidents of the kind. Even the firestick patrons, whose future is ritually linked with that of their moran wards, have a vested interest in delaying the reality of the present. This is to suggest that the kind of insight offered by some informants, that the danger from ‘eyes’ emanates from society at large, could logically be extended to interpreting the dangers that are felt to surround eunoto . Episode 4 . Seizing the ritual leaders . The migration to the eunoto site had to take place on the fifth day of a Maasai lunar month, reckoned from the morning when the old moon was no longer visible (24th April 1977). When the time came, moran feasting in the forest nearby were summoned and the number in the villages increased overnight from about 100 moran to perhaps 450. This was the first time that the whole age-group had ever been assembled in one spot. Forty-nine of the moran were selected to lead the procession. Singing emosiroi , they were followed by a herd of forty-eight white heifers and a young black bull, and then by all the other moran. They were blessed by a manyata-mother, who dipped a handful of grass into a milk gourd and flicked milk at them as they passed through her gateway and out of the larger village. This was the false start, and when all the moran had passed out, the patrons ordered them to disband. (Coining the metaphor, the ritual rebirth had been aborted.) The procession proper had to wait until the manyata-mothers packed their donkeys and had left to be at the eunoto site before the moran. During this lull, the patrons directed the moran to process between the villages performing their lion dance. Some patrons, who were trying to slow down the tempo, were visibly moved, two with tears down their cheeks. It was the lion dance, I was told, that stirred their memories - and it was being performed too fast. In other respects, the patrons clearly showed that they had total control and were determined to dominate this occasion. Throughout the day they marshalled the moran for instruction, for dancing, and for the chores of moving, and one or two lashed out with their long whips on impulse. The moran seemed drained of their earlier confidence, for the migration was a prelude to the evening climax when the identities of the ritual leader and his deputy would be revealed. Later, several moran described to me their feelings of apprehension on this day: a dread of the approach of evening and of the awful possibility that they themselves or perhaps one of their close friends might be seized as a ritual leader. One moran whose ancestry made him ineligible expressed his own vicarious fears. Whoever they were, two of his age mates were to be plucked away, violating the manyata bond of sharing in everything including a common destiny. The ritual leaders were to be condemned to an uncertain future, even an early death, and he felt as though a part of his own self was condemned. Eventually all was packed for the migration. The procession was led by a few firestick patrons who knew the secret location, a spot about four miles further south. Then came the manyata-mothers with their laden donkeys, some straggled from time to time, and others stopped to readjust their loads, halting the procession that followed. Then came the remaining patrons, and at their rear a few with whips to control the pace of the moran, so that they did not overtake the straggling women. Then came the moran in four files, two for Maparasha and one each for Meto and Silale, wearing such lionskin trophies and ostrich feather headdresses as they had. They carried their shields, held high their manyata flags, and raised their spears to the rhythm of their lion dance. Each time the procession was halted by the patrons, the dancing would intensify and minor epidemics of shaking broke out: a yelp, some shaking, and then more yelps and more shaking. Possibly thirty of the moran shook, while many more were shivering. Finally at the tailend of the procession, came a file of about thirty girls, escorted by four moran. By the time that the body of the procession arrived at the eunoto site, the women had already been directed by the leading firestick patrons to build their huts in a large circle. This was the point, incidentally at which the violent eunoto affray had erupted in Purko in 1945 when rival manyat competed for the prime position in the village. In Matapato, there was no prime position to be fought over; and here in any event, manyata rivalries appeared to have dissipated before the migration. When the moran arrived, they were directed to fetch logs for the fire and to cut thorn branches for the village fence. In a matter of hours an unremarkable stretch of open bushland overshadowed by the mountain was transformed into a joint manyata village. Meanwhile, the patrons blessed the forty-nine young cattle in the centre of the village; and then holding down the young black bull, they kindled the manyata fire on his back. The manner of lighting this fire is popularly related to the misfortune that dogs the ritual leader. According to one version, it is the unpropitiousness of lighting it on a living bull that has the effect of a firestick patrons' curse. According to another it is ‘medicine’ provided by the Prophet which they put in the flames that has the effect of sorcery. 3 The fracas concerned respectively the Ngorisho R among the Loodokilani, the Meruturud L and the Nyankusi R among the Purko. The Annual Report for 1945 (AR/Kaj-Nar/1945:3) presumably refers obliquely to this last incident. Various moran looked on, aware that their patrons were performing an essential preliminary to installing the two incumbents in a matter of hours. As the shadows lengthened and the new moon was just visible, all the huts had been erected and the moran were called to the village. Most of them were quickly rounded up, but some were found lurking in the bush nearby, apparently hoping that their absence would not be noticed. There were rumours that several had already run away. Once assembled, the moran were mustered round the patrons' fire, singing emosiroi and facing inwards in a double circle, about thirty yards in diameter with a pathway between the outer and inner rings. Then further delays prolonged the suspense when it was discovered that some of the manyata-mothers had not yet taken a flame from the patrons' fire to kindle their own hearths. This prompted a routine check on all huts. Eventually the patrons were satisfied that the procedure for seizing the two ritual leaders could continue. A posse wearing capes and consisting of the three moran spokesmen and four strong aides ambled round the pathway between the two rings. They glanced over the moran as they passed, and were poised at any moment to seize the ritual leader. In the gathering twilight, they continued to circumambulate for perhaps twenty minutes while the other moran continued the slow measured tones of emosiroi with tense shivery expressions. One or two yelped and started to shake from time to time. As darkness closed in, it only became clear that the posse had seized the ritual leader when there was a cry and a scuffle. Other moran near the spot joined in to hold him, while a woman's apron was forced over his shoulders. Shivering, screaming, and throwing his limbs violently in all directions, he was half dragged and half carried to his mother's hut and forced to sit beside her fire opposite three firestick patrons. For a time he continued to scream and seemed almost delirious, while his mother and his young brother, who was a manyata herdboy, were also overcome with grief. About fifteen of his closer moran friends gathered, singing to comfort him, and a cow with male calf was tethered in front of the hut as a gift from his age-group. The commotion eventually subsided and the moran were again assembled into their rings to sing emosiroi ; and the same procedure was followed to seize and instal the deputy ritual leader. Once this too had been completed, the circle was finally broken. With a sense of general relief there was dancing and high spirits in various parts of the village, by groups of moran with their girls, and also by manyata-mothers in their own groups. For the first time that day, the festive atmosphere returned and continued into the night. The Pleiades star cluster was by now barely visible in the evening sky, and the eunoto sacrifice, which formed the next climax, could not be performed until the cluster had reappeared in the early morning in two months time. The sheer size of the gathering in these hard times could not be sustained for more than a day. Next morning, there was a general exodus by both elders and moran, seeking food elsewhere. Some moran made their way back to their forest camps. The parting gift for elders was one mug of tea to be shared among every four men, and it was accepted that there was no point in remonstrating for more. There was no more. Those that remained in the vicinity were primarily the manyata moran and their mothers.\",\n",

       "  \"Not only does aguardiente in some contexts serve as medium by means of which witchcraft can be communicated, but also it has a certain disease producing potential of its own when it is taken in certain amounts within a certain time period. (The ceremonial drinking plus one or more adjacent informal drinking units.) We will now review a few of the disease processes which are interpreted as beginning immediately adjacent to drinking performances. The most common illness that results from drinking is a state that may be glossed as a “hangover” /GOMA, XCAMEL YUUN TRAWO/. This is a minor illness which involves the symptoms of “headache, loss of appetite, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, trembling,” the response to which is selected from the following alternative set. The condition of GOMA is nearly exclusive with the ability to engage in routine agricultural performances. This means that the day after a ceremonial drinking plus informal drinking segment, a man does not work. He has the choice, then, of staying around the house or leaving the house to perform some minor tasks such as gathering poles to support chayote vines, looking at his cattle, or any other task that takes him out of the household setting. This is an important distinction since if a man stays around the house he increases the probability that he will continue drinking by some considerable degree. The confusion of setting with cure for GOMA is further reduced if we consider the specific remedies which are employed. Aguardiente is a “hot” substance. This “heat” causes the illness, and the illness can be reduced by drinking remedies which are “cool” or “cold.” Coca cola is such a remedy. A man may stay around the house and drink coca cola by way of reducing the GOMA. A second remedy for reducing a hangover is to drink as much as onehalf a pint of aguardiente. This is the Tzeltal equivalent to the “hair of the dog” response. Drinking a small amount of aguardiente and staying around the house are the two conditions which make it most likely that the man will continue drinking that day. Drinking coca cola and staying around the house make it slightly less likely that a man will drink on that day. Finally, drinking either aguardiente or coca cola and leaving the house to perform some minor task makes it less and less probable that a man will go on drinking that day. These observations are relevant to an interpretation of the cure for a hangover since they clearly include alternative plans for furth action which either produce further hangovers or do not. In other words, if one wishes to cure a hangover and go on drinkin he drinks aguardiente and stays in his house where his previous day's drinking companions will be sure to find him. If, on the other hand, one wishes to stop drinking, he will drink coca cola and leave the house.\",\n",

When a patient is being treated, kin and neighbours come to attend. The drumming wakens the disease in all of them who have been ill of it before and they too will join in the violent dance of the sufferer. The disease links together all sufferers, and anyone who recovers from a severe attack has to become a leech treating it.',\n",

The Blackfeet believed disease was caused by an evil spirit entering a person’s body and that it could be cured by a doctor who possessed the power to expell the spirit. As Blackfoot doctors received their detailed instructions for curing the sick in dreams, their methods differed. Many, however, employed singing, drumming, and calling upon their supernatural helper for assistance. Not uncommonly, the doctor appeared to extract some small object from the sick person’s body as proof that the cause of illness had been removed. Some doctors were specialists in treating broken bones, snake bites, or battle wounds. Many of the most renowned doctors were women. It was customary to pay the doctor one or more horses for his services. The family of a victim of a prolonged illness might give all their possessions to the Indian doctor.',\n",

Sometimes comes the Sayyid Mohammed el Barr, a stout personage, formerly governor of Zayla, and still highly respected by the people on acount of his pure pedigree. With him is the Fakih Adan, a savan of ignoble origin. * The system of caste, which prevails in El Yemen, though not in the northern parts of Arabia, is general throughout the Somali country. The principal families of outcasts are the following. The Yebir correspond with the Dushan of Southern Arabia: the males are usually jesters to the chiefs, and both sexes take certain parts at festivals, marriages, and circumcisions. The number is said to be small, amounting to about 100 families in the northern Somali country. The Tomal or Handad, the blacksmiths, originally of Aydur race, have become vile by intermarriage with serviles. They must now wed maidens of their own class, and live apart from the community: their magical practices are feared by the people, —the connection of wits and witchcraft is obvious,—and all private quarrels are traced to them. It has been observed that the blacksmith has ever been looked upon with awe by barbarians on the same principle that made Vulcan a deity. In Abyssinia all artisans are Budah, sorcerers, especially the blacksmith, and he is a social outcast as among the Somal; even in El Hejaz, a land, unlike Yemen, opposed to distinctions amongst Moslems, the Khalawiyah, who work in metal, are considered vile. Throughout the rest of El Islam the blacksmith is respected as treading in the path of David, the father of the craft. The word “Tomal,” opposed to Somal, is indigenous. “Handad” is palpably a corruption of the Arabic “Haddad,” iron-worker. . The Midgan, “one-hand,” corresponds with the Khadim of Yemen: he is called Rami or “archer” by the Arabs. There are three distinct tribes of this people, who are numerous in the Somali country: the best genealogists cannot trace their origin, though some are silly enough to derive them, like the Akhdam, from Shimr. All, however, agree in expelling the Midgan from the gentle blood of Somali land, and his position has been compared to that of Freedman amongst the Romans. These people take service under the different chiefs, who sometimes entertain great numbers to aid in forays and frays; they do not, however, confine themselves to one craft. Many Midgans employ themselves in hunting and agriculture. Instead of spear and shield, they carry bows and a quiver full of diminutive arrows, barbed and poisoned with the Waba,—a weapon used from Faizoghli to the Cape of Good Hope. Like the Veddah of Ceylon, the Midgan is a poor shot, and scarcely strong enough to draw his stiff bow. He is accused of maliciousness; and the twanging of his string will put to flight a whole village. The poison is greatly feared: it causes, say the people, the hair and nails to drop off, and kills a man in half an hour. The only treatment known is instant excision of the part; and this is done the more frequently, because here, as in other parts of Africa, such stigmates are deemed ornamental. In appearance the Midgan is dark and somewhat stunted; he is known to the people by peculiarities of countenance and accent.

We may therefore conclude that the Andaman Islanders believe that there is a peculiar power in foods (or in some foods) which makes it dangerous to eat them. This danger may be expressed by saying that the person who has eaten food will, unless he takes certain precautions, be liable to be ill. Now sickness is believed to be caused by the spirits of the jungle and the sea, and therefore an alternative or equivalent statement of the same belief is that after a person has eaten food he is in danger from the spirits. We may therefore conclude that the word ot-kimil , when it is used to describe the condition of a person who has eaten food, denotes simply this condition of danger, and nothing more. For this we shall find ample confirmation later on. Subject to such later confirmation I will here state what has been maintained, which is (1) that the era-puli patterns are to be explained as being protective, (2) that the eating of food is regarded as dangerous, and (3) that this danger is associated in the minds of the natives with sickness and with the spirits.

       "  'The personal name of this man-god was Saku, or as some said, Sako; according to Pa Fenuatara, his descendant, he was known on earth as Pu Siku. He was the son of the Kafika chief Asoaso (see Chap. 4). He was a “sacred child” (nephew) to the people of Nga Faea, since his mother came from that group, and tradition links his name with that of one section of the modern representatives of Nga Faea, the lineage of Siku. 24 Those who look for similarities may note that according to Codrington (1891, 94-9) a chief of Florida named Siko, who afterwards became a ghost, instituted the seasonal Matambala rites. One member of this group, son of Pa Fangatoto, bore in 1929 the personal name Sako. Ordinarily however, the personal name of the mangod was never uttered by Tikopia. He was known instead as Te Atua i Kafika, “the Deity of Kafika”, or more familiarly by the people of the clan merely as “Te Atua”, “The Deity”, no further specification being needed. This is in itself an indication of his supremacy. He bore also several ritual names which were invoked on appropriate occasions by the different clan chiefs. His personal name among the gods, which was consequently that most properly to be invoked in the kava , was Mapusia. By the Ariki Kafika, however, he was called upon often under the honorific title of “Toku Ariki Tapu”, “My Sacred Chief”. The personal name Mapusia was rarely used in the kava on account of its sacredness--“it is not called upon, called upon constantly” said the Ariki in justification of his euphemistic mode of address. Another of these titles was “Te Ariki Fakamataku”, “The Fear-Causing Chief”. He was regarded as principally responsible for storms and thunder, which was caused by the trailing of his staff as he walked through the heavens clattering it from side to side and making the welkin resound. His anger was believed to be terrible. He could overwhelm an offender by striking him or his family with sickness and death. He could blast the whole island with drought, a hurricane or pestilence. Although he was the principal deity of the Kafika clan alone, he was feared by all the people of the island. Pa Vainunu said, “Look at the chiefly houses--they are respected, it is true--but the whole of the land obeys the one Chief, the chief of the Kafika. In this land which stands here the one god is above all others, the Deity of Kafika. No god can come and supplant him; he is high because he is strong.” This was a partisan statement, from a man of Kafika, but it did express the situation as it actually appeared.',\n",
       "  'Under the unhygienic and unhealthy conditions, the Onges keep on struggling with life. They apply their indigenous methods of curing diseases. The most common method of treatment, prevalent among Onges, is to use clay. It is specially done in times of fever. Cipriani has also made a mention of such local practice while stating that, ‘for any kind of fever the Onges turn immediately to their stock remedy, smearing the entire body with the usual mixture of ochre, turtle fat and honey. The legs, arms, chest and abdomen are then tightly bound with strips of Ficus bark, which are removed and renewed from time to time. Whether the patient has pain in the abdomen or in the chest, appropriate part is given a form of vigorous massage by the feet of one of the bystanders. For fever, the red clay is believed to be having more medical value; white clay is meant to save the skin from insect-bite. According to the Onges, the clay, ochre, honey and turtle fat have medicinal value and are used for cure as well as prevention. The clay as such or mixed with other medical substance, is used in case of the bite by some snake or scorpion, constipation and breast infection. It is further believed that honey, too, has some medical value and helps in quick healing of wounds. In addition to the medicinal substances, another method of curing a patient of wounds and pains is to expose him to hot smoke. The other method is through the “holy man” who, with his powers, helps cure some disease. It is also regarded as a chief method of prevention. ‘Kuvera’ is their traditional medicineman and helps cure the patients suffering from the influence of evil spirits. So far, no agency of health or any other department concerned with providing medical facilities to the Onges exists in any of the camps of the Onges. Even in the two major settlements at Dugong-Creek and South-West Bay, not even a compounder is posted. Some medical facilities exist at Hut Bay, which is a far off place from Onge hutments. Because of their traditional beliefs and the distance the Onges are reluctant to go to the dispensary at Hut Bay. In fact the Onges could be better motivated for modern drugs and medicines provided some agencies in this regard could work right in their major settlement areas. Looking to the problem of biological extinction among the Onges, there is an urgent need to establish better medical facilities at least in the two bigger settlements. The health educator has to convince the Onges about the superiority of the modern methods of treatment. Apart from curing diseases, a thorough medical check-up, at regular intervals of time, of the Onges is desirable. In the context of the declining number of the Onges the health programme should be under-taken on priority basis and in right earnest.',\n",

The magpie is either one of the things seen on the way, or perhaps indicates the totemic cycle to which the ilpindja belongs. With the line lunpurgnula manyinila we have a different set of ideas.

However since they most commonly make use of a Ring (those Drums sent me by my Lord Chancellor, having no others than such) this is the reason, why the so often-mentioned anonymous M. S. has call'd them barely Rings. The Ring , says he, laid upon the Drum, did not stand still in any certain Place. Olaus Magnus calls them Brazen Serpents or Toads : For so they call those Rings, not that they are really such, or have any resemblance to Serpents or Toads, but because by those Rings they represent those Creatures, which they look upon to be very acceptable to the Devil, and whose Pictures they frequently make use of in their Magick. Peucerus calls them Frogs, They have likewise , says he, a brazen Frog, fastned to an Iron Bar : Perhaps because there is no great difference betwixt a Toad and a Frog. Which makes Olaus Petri say: In the Center they draw the Picture of their God, upon which they lay a Frog or some other Piece made of Brass. Torn us tells us that the Laplanders call it Arpa. The Index , says he, which they cali Arpa, is composed out of several Chain Rings, made of Copper, Iron, Brass or Silver : Which shews us, that they are not only made of Brass, but also of several other Metals. The Hammer they call that same Instrument, wherewith they beat the Drum, as we may see from what has been alledged out of Olqus Magnus and Johannes Torn us ; the Last of which says; They raise their Familiar Spirits by beating the Skin with a Hammer . But this Hammer must be imagined to have the least resemblance to a Smith's Hammer, as the Engraver of Olaus Magnus's had failly persuaded himself, but it is a certain Instrument so call'd by the Laplanders , and dedicated to this peculiar use, made of a Raindeer's Horn, branching out like a Fork; this being the Head of the Hammer, the rest the Handle. The true Shape of it I have given you in the same Cut, which contains the two Drums under A . and B . the Hammer being mark'd with H. With this Hammer they beat the Drum, not so much to make a Noise, but thereby to put the Ring, laid upon the Skin, into motion, so as to pass over the Pictures, till they are satisfied in what they look for. And thus I have given you a description of the Lapland Drum , with all its Appertinencies, viz . the Ring and the Hammer, such as they use among the Laplanders , subject to the Crown of Sweden . The Finlanders , bordering upon Norway , and subject to Denmark , do likewife use those Drums, but something different of those I have described to you just now; as is manifest from the Description given of them by the learned Olaus Wormius . It is however my Opinion, That the difference betwixt theirs and ours is not real, but rather accidental; arising from thence, that the Drum described by Wormius , was perhaps intended for some particular use. But let us see, for Wormius describes the Drum he makes mention of in the Description of his Study; The Lapland Drum , says he, which they use in their Magick, and by beating which, to a certain Tune, they pretend to discover many Things, is made of an oval Piece of Wood bollowed; its Length is about a Foot, its Bredth ten Inches, having six Ho'es cut in it with a Handle in the middle; whereby they hold it with the left Hand, whilst they beat with the Right. Over this they stretch a Skin. fasined to it with Nerves, painted with divers rude Shap'd Figures, drawn with Blood or some other Red Colour. Upon this lies a Piece of Brass in the Shape of a Rhomboides, somewhat convex, its Diameter being of two Inches, in the Middle of which, and on each Corner, bangs a small Brass Chain. The Instrument made of Bone, wherewith they beat the Drum, is about six Inches long. of the thickness of a little Finger, resembling the Latin T. The Laplanders use this Drum upon divers Occasions. and pretend to do great Matters by the help of it; which makes them have it in great Esteem, and keep it with much Reverence; they secure and wrap it up together with the Index and Hammer in a Lambskin. The Laplanders, says Samuel Rheen, set a great value upon their Drum, for they always keep it wrap'd up, together with the Rings and Hammer, in a Lamb-Skin . Thus it is in my Edition, tho' I have found it in another written Loomskin , which does not signifie a Lamb-Skin, but the Skin of a certain Bird, of the Water Fowl kind, and is in this Country called Loom. Wormius has given us a Description of it in his Study, and I shall perhaps have an Opportunity of describing it more at large, when I shall publish a Catalogue of the Rarities I preserve in my Study. Nay, they look upon this Drum as a Sacred Thing, which for this Reason, must not be touch'd by marriagable Women. No Woman , says the same author, that is come to Age of Maturity, is permitted to touch the Drum . If the Drum is to be removed from one Place to another, it is either carried last of all, and by the Hands of a Man, or else must be brought by a quite different Road, or some untrod Way. The Drum , says the same Author, never goes First, but Last of all, being carried by a Man, and not a Woman; somesimes thro' such Roads as were never made use of before . He gives us likewise the Reason of it, viz . Because they are afraid, that if any Body, but especially a Woman should pass the same way after it, would be in great danger of losing either her Health, or perhaps her Life; and this Hazard they run for the first three Days after; of which they do give you several Instances. They will tell you, says he, that if any Woman Kind, that is come to Age of Maturity, should travel the same Road, thro' which the Drum has been carried, within three Days before, the same would either dye immediately, or at least fall into some great Misfortune, and this they prove by many Instances . It seems as if the Devil would not have his Worship despised, but keeps a strict Hand over those who neglect his Rites, by punishing them severely, as far as God is pleased to permit; so that there is no great reason to doubt of the Truth of those Examples. Now, because it happens sometimes, Women must of necessity travel the same way, the Devil is somewhat more favourable to them, provided they pay him, as an Acknowledgment, a Ring of Brass, to the same Drum, that was carried that way before them. If it so happen , says the before-mentioned Author, that a Woman is forced to travel the same way, thro' which the Drum has been carried before, she is abliged to present a Brass Ring for the use of the said Drum . But since we have told you before, that according to their Opinion, they can effect strange Things, by the help of this Drum, we must take a view, what these Things are, and how they are performed. Olaus Petri mentions Three; relating either to their Hunting, to their Sacrifices, and the enquiring into far distant Matters. They have , says he, a threefold use for this Drum, in relation to their Hunting, Sacrifices, and the knowledge of Things at a distance. Samuel Rheen mentions Four. The First , To enquire what passes in other Places, tho' never so remote. The Second , To know the good and bad Success of any Undertaking, and what issue any Distemper is like to have. The Third , To Cure Diseases. The Fourth , To know what sort of Sacrifice their Gods are pleased with, and what kind of Beasts each God desires for his Sacrifice. They don't all use the same way or Ceremonies, in making their Enquiries. There are however several Circumstances which are to be observed by all. The First is, That they take care to stretch the Skin very stiff, by holding it near the Fire. They hold , says Olaus Petri, the Skin to the Fire, to make it Stiff . Secondly, That they don't always beat in one Place, but round about the Index or Ring. Thirdly, That they first begin to beat softly, and so continue stronger and stronger, till they have done their Business. Torn us says to this effect: He lifts up the Drum a little, and then beats round about the Index, first softly till the Index begin to stir and to move about, and when he finds it removed from the Place where it first laid, to one or the other side of the Drum, the Drummer beats harder and harder, till the Index Points at a certain Sign, from whence they may draw a Conjecture as to the Point they sought for . Another Ceremony they constantly observe, is, That he who beats the Drum, does it upon his Knees, not standing, and so do all the rest that are present. He that is skilful in this Art , says the same Author, falls down upon his Knees, as well as all the rest, and so he takes the Drum . As to the Occasions, of their beating the Drum, we having given you the last of them already; we must now proceed to the rest, the first of which is, to know, what is transacted in far distant Places; concerning which Olaus Magnus speaks to this effect; If they are solicitous to know in what Condition their Friends or Foes are, tho' at 500 or 1000 Leagues distance, they go to a Lap or Einlander, whom they know well skill'd in this Art, and by the means of a Present of a Linnen Sute of Cloths, or some Mony, they oblige him to try his Skill, to know what their Friends or Foes are doing at that time, and where they are . And so he proceeds to give an Account of the whole manner of doing it, of which we shall say A In Deser. Norway. more anon. Peter Clandi , speaking of the Finlanders under the Jurifdiction of Norway , says: They are so Skilful in this Art, that they can satisfie any Body, that wants to know, what other People are doing, at a great distance . He likewise relates the manner of performing it, and gives us an Instance, which happened at Bergen , the chief Trading City of Norway , which is to be seen upon record there, viz . in the publick Register of the German Factory: There was one John Delling , living in that City, in the Quality of a Factor, of a certain German Merchant, who meeting one time with a Friend of his called James Smausuend , who had a certain Norwegian Finlaplander in his Company, he ask'd him, whether he could tell him, what his Master was then doing in Germany? The Finlaplander having answered him he could, began immediately to make a great Noise, as if he were Drunk, then leaping and turning himself several times round in a Circle, he fell upon the Ground without any Sense or Motion; after he had continued thus for some time, he recovered out of his Trance, started up, and told him, what his Master was transacting in Germany ; which being immediately entred into the Register of the German Merchants, was found, upon enquity made afterwards, to agree with what the Finlaplander had told him. A memorable Instance, which deserves the more Credit, as being confirmed by publick Authority. There are besides this many more Inslances of this kind, related upon the Credit and Experience of those now living, among which, that which happned to Johannes Torn us deserves to be taken particular Notice of; a certain Laplander , who is still living, having told him all what happned to him in his first Journey into Lapland ; he never having seen him before, These are his Words; He told me truly and exactly every thing that bad happned to me in my Journey into Eapland: And, notwithstanding I was sensible of the Truth of what the Laplander had told me, concerning this journey, I told him, that what he had said was altogether false; for fear he sbould glory in his Diabolical Art, or rely upon it, as a means to investigate Truth . There is not the least shew of Reason, to Question the Truth of this Relation, being founded upon the Authority' of a Person not in the least addicted to Superstition, who speaks by his own Experience. The Authors however differ in the Method, used in making those Discoveries. Olaus Magnus describes it thus: The Drummer goes into some private Room, accompanied only by one Person, besides his own Wife. Then by beating upon the Anvil with his Hammer be moves the Brazen Frog or Serpent about the Figures, muttering at the same time certain Words; till he falls into a Trance, lying extended on the Ground, as if Dead: His Companion in the mean while taking great Care, that no Gnat, Flie or any other living Creature touch him. By the force of his Charms, his Soul is by some evil D mon or other carryed into some distant Place, from whence he brings back (as a Token that be has executed his Commission) a Ring, Knife, or some such Thing; which, so soon as he rises from the Ground, he shews, and declares to his Companion. Peter Claudi gives us the following Account of it: He falls upon the Ground without any Life or Motion, turning quite yellow or Black in the Face. Thus he continues for One or more Hours, according to the distance of the Place, of which enquiry is to he made. When he recovers from this Trance, he is able to tell what passes in that Place, and what those People transact there, of which Enquiry was made . Here no mention is made either of a Drum, Song, his Companions, or any Tokens of the Performance of the Business; which difference must be attributed to this, that each Author gives an Account of what seem'd most worth taking notice of to him, without excluding the rest, mentioned by others; so that from what has been said already, the use of the Drum can scarce be call'd in question; but what Olaus Petri relates of the Drums, made for this particular use, viz . That they have a Handle shaped like a Cross, deserves our special Observation. The Drum they make use of, says he, is the same as I deseribed to you before, with this difference only, that the lower part of it is divided into four Parts, by a Cross, by which the Sorcerer bolds it with one Hand . Here you find a Handle made in the shape of a Cross, of which make is the Drum, which I told you was prefented to me by my Lord Henry Flemming , Colonel of a Finland Regiment of Foot, the Draught of the lower Side of which you see in the next following Figure.\",\n",

       "  \"“According to Iban belief, every person has a semengat , or separable soul. This semengat , during life, inhabits the body, though it does have the power of wandering abroad; and dream experiences, say the Iban, are evidence of this But in addition to the semengat , there is another entity called the ayu, which is a kind of secondary soul or soul-substitute. Everyone has both a semengat and an ayu as an old manang , or shaman, put it: ‘Our semengat and ayu share the same breath’ (‘Semengat enggau ayu kitai saum seput’) . But the ayu does not reside in the body. It takes the form of a kind of plant - it is usually likened to the bamboo (buloh) in appearance - and it is believed to grow on a far off mountain. On the slopes of this vast mountain grow the myriad ayu of all the Iban people, and there they are tended by an aged and beneficient supernatural being named Manang Betuah. The ayu of each bilek-family are conceived as of growing in a separate and compact clump, and when a child is born a new shoot appears at the base of the clump, just as it does with the bamboo plant itself. The health of the various members of the family - so it is believed - is controlled in a kind of magical symbiosis by the state of growth of their various ayu . If, for example, the ayu should become overgrown with creepers, the individual whose soul-substitute it is, will become ill; and shamans (manang) are frequently commissioned to visit the ayu of sick persons to free them from encumbrances, and generally to tend them. It is the soul of the shaman that carries out this task, while the shaman himself is in a state of trance. The purpose of the nusop ayu ritual, which often accompanies adoption, is the cutting away of the child's ayu from the ayu clump of his natal group, and the replanting of it with the ayu clump of his adoptive bilek-family .”\",\n",

According to one account she carried with her an infant son; according to another the child was born after she had reached Kafika. The child was protected by his grandfather who named him “Fakaarofatia”, “Orphaned”. Soon after his arrival the portion of flesh was still hanging up outside the house, and from it the fat dripped, making a little pool on the ground. The infant, crawling about, strayed that way. It dabbled its fingers in the liquid, then sucked them. Hence, it is said arose the morbid disease which afflicts the chiefs of Fangarere, owing to the fact that they touched and actually absorbed some of the liquids from their dead father. This is the disease termed te mataora , an ulceration akin to yaws.

In her case, there was not at first any general agreement as to the cause of her illness, and she was taken to the local maternity centre by her father and her mother’s brother. Here she was examined by the visiting European supervisor, who wanted her moved to a hospital where she could have European attention. This necessitated consulting her husband, who would have had to pay for the treatment, and he flatly refused to allow it, holding that the disease was supernaturally caused.

       "  'The means of achieving ritual purity and strength include, besides the rules for sexual activity, certain food prohibitions, and withdrawal into the temple, confession, which consists of an acknowledgment of sins. It takes place only when one is sick or otherwise has misfortune. It is not because sin in itself oppresses the Kágaba and he wishes to be freed from it that he confesses, in order to be able to live as a pure man, but because otherwise it would go ill with him. The most important sins known to him are forbidden cohabitation, especially unnatural sexual satisfaction with close relatives or with animals ( sagá sagá ), as is given as the cause of the great flood, and adultery. Another expression for “to sin” is zinkuali . The fact that precisely sexual excesses are regarded as sins and the cause of sickness and evil undoubtedly lies in a basic view of the Kágaba which is also to be found among other tribes, namely, that cohabitation and intercourse with a woman weaken the strength of a man and endanger the success of every undertaking. This accounts for the magical strength of the novices, as long as they have not yet had intercourse with a woman.',\n",

       "  'The method of treatment for both mayembe and mizimu is to induce the spirit to speak through the victim and identify itself so that a medicine may be prepared or the person who sent it may be induced to remove it. I was called to see an elderly woman who had had severe stomach ache. She was surrounded by women neighbours who had covered her head with a cloth and were giving her inhalations of burning peppers in order to make things so unpleasant for the spirit that it would reveal itself. At the time of my arrival she was extremely agitated and was making a series of incoherent barking noises and did indeed seem possessed in some way. From lack of time and out of consideration for her son who had taken me there I was obliged to interrupt the proceedings. Palpation of her stomach revealed that there was no gross illness. I therefore reassured her and those around that she was recovering and gave her the only medicine I had with me at the time, a tranquillizer tablet (chlorpromazine 100 mgm). She apparently made a quick and uneventful recovery with no recurrence. The interruption, however, had made some of the women neighbours angry because it had prevented the act being played out to the full. The true diagnosis therefore could not be made, since it was assumed that the spirit had been about to reveal itself. It is quite likely that her barking would have become coherent enough for some, possibly cryptic, information to have been gathered from it. This kind of an attack by a muzimu is known as kigalanga . Mair (Note 27 Note — Mair (1934, p. 226). An account of the capturing of mizimu by causing the patient to vomit them into a gourd is given by Kagwa (1934, p. 126). Ssekamwa (1967, p. 37) also describes a case of the capture of mayembe . The involuntary shivering which comes with fever may be interpreted as empewo which means a cold wind and so by extension a ghost. Dr. J. Bennett tells me that the word is also used occasionally for cases of kwashiorkor in infants. The Baganda recognise that this comes following the weaning of the child. The body swells and because of this the skin feels cold so that it is thought that the illness is due to the child getting cold at night now that it is separated from the mother. The word empewo in this context merely means that the child gets cold and does not refer to the extended meaning of a ghost. The illness is properly known as obwosi and also as omusana, the sun, because the stretched pale skin shines like the sun. ) says that “the spirit is supposed to enter the stomach by the mouth and cause a kind of indigestion known as kigalanga, whose first symptom is said to be a very cold feeling. This is regarded as the manifestation par excellence of spirit possession . . .” Indeed the word empewo is used for both a spirit and a cold wind. A muzimu can attack people of either sex seizing them by the throat and killing them instantly. In the case of kigalanga however time is available to treat the condition, and “the first thing to do on such an occasion is to ‘make the spirit speak’.” (Mair, ibid).',\n",

       "  'Weaning is done when the baby is about one year old or somewhat less, but long before this he is beginning to get solid food occasionally. Alternating at first between the breast and small quantities of masticated food, the former is withdrawn more and more. But as a general rule the process is not so easy and is almost never managed without a violent protest from the babies, who cry, shriek, and kick in order to gain access to the breast. The mothers then frequently try to explain to the baby, by estures and words, that they ought not to nurse in the presence of other people “because the breast is very obscene.” By taking the breast abruptly away from him when another person enters, and making appropriate gestures and indications of embarrassment, disgust, and displeasure, the mother thus shows the baby that this is now a matter of a prohibited and secret act of which society does not approve. Thus a baby finally is allowed to nurse only on the very rare occasions when the mother is alone with him. If the baby nevertheless insists and rejects larger quantities of solid food, the father, the mother, or any other adult present tries to frighten him with threats: “If you continue nursing, the snakes will come. If you go on nursing, the toad will eat you.” The next step is the most effective one: the mother rubs her nipples with pepper ( 8 . Capsicum . ), lemon, or any other substance which has a bitter taste. With this, nursing ends completely. The babies react with fits of anger, and many times with violent vomiting, which, as we shall see below, is repeated still later as a sign of protest. If the mother should become pregnant while she is nursing a baby, the latter is always weaned one or two months before the birth, since it is said that otherwise the baby would get sick, and in these cases the pepper or lemon method is always used. Nonetheless, it does occur that after this period and after the delivery, both the first baby and the newborn child nurse simultaneously, although the first one 191 might have been weaned already and fed only solid food. If the mother of a baby should become sick during the period of nursing, the child is immediately weaned, since it is said that the baby can catch the sickness from his mother’s milk. If the baby becomes sick, he is likewise immediately weaned, generally causing his death. The first food given to a baby during the process of weaning and following this is panela water or malanga soup, a broth of ripe platano or of uncooked platano, or pieces of cooked potato. It is always his mother herself who gives him this food, first putting it into the mouth of the baby with her fingers and later using a small spoon made out of a totuma /fruit of the calabash tree/. Older sisters of the baby are never entrusted with this task, and other adult women only very rarely. The food of the baby is cooked separately and not together with that for the family.',\n",

       "  'No shame was shown by Tikopia in admitting fear of atua , though some people alleged they were less afraid than others. I never heard any criticism of a person for admitting to being afraid, though some people took pride in not showing fear. In 1929 Pa Fenuatara said he was not afraid of atua and demonstrated this by going alone at night from one side of the island to the other. In telling me this he said that the night before he actually saw an atua about five yards away and it fled before him; he accelerated its going by waving his firestick at it. Atua , he said, were frightened of fire and of all pungent scents, too, though they had their own. But in 1952 Pa Fenuatara asked to borrow my electric torch one night, saying he was afraid, of atua . The difference was probably due to his age, and to the great number of recent deaths in the epidemic, which had generated many stories of ghosts abroad. Standardized personal differences of response to an experience of atua were recognized. I was told how a man going at night sees an atua standing, is frightened, retreats and yells.

I own this point to Dr A. de Vente. But here, as in those cases for which the prescription was wrong, there was a sequential series of blocks to falsifiability: if the specific treatment failed, this would be a sign that the affliction was not simple and it therefore required specialist treatment. If the healer's specifics failed, this was a sign of evil interference which had to be identified by divination, and in this way a structural block could be invoked, even if the patient died. Thus a difficult case would move along one axis of the table from individual to communal and the other from symptomatic to non-symptomatic treatment, hence diagonally. The line could be extended off the table since for affliction beyond the norm, such as the early 1890s smallpox epidemic, recourse could only be through appeal to the unseen powers and there divinatory practice merged with the other functions of the royal graves.\",\n",
       "  'To begin with, all people must periodically visit a priest for confession—in private or in public—of all their actions and intentions. An important mechanism of control is introduced here by the idea that sickness is, in the last analysis, the consequence of a state of sinfulness incurred by not living according to the “Law of the Mother.” A man will therefore scrutinize his conscience in every detail and will try to be absolutely honest about his actions and intentions, to avoid falling ill or to cure an existing sickness. Confession takes place at night in the ceremonial house, the máma reclining in his hammock while the confessant sits next to him on a low bench. The other men must observe silence or, at least, converse in subdued voices, while between the priest and the confessant unfolds a slow, halting dialogue in which the máma formulates several searching questions about the confessant’s family life, social relations, food intake, ritual obligations, dreams, and many other aspects of his daily life. People are supposed to confess not only the actual fault they have committed, but also their evil intentions, their sexual or aggressive fantasies, anything that might come to their minds under the questioning of the priest. The nagging fear of sickness, the hypochondriacal observation and discussion of the most insignificant symptoms, will make people completely unburden themselves. There can be no doubt that confession is a psychotherapeutic institution of the first order, within the general system of Kogi religion.',\n",

For some superstitious reason the Onge are simply horrified at the thought of touching such an enormous flying bat. Among the fruits, those of a plant whose wood has such a revolting smell that it is known, in English, as “stooltree”, are believed to have exceptional protective properties for the human body. The fruits themselves smell even worse than the wood, but this, to the Onge, makes them appetizing rather than disgusting. Concerning honey, and the many sugary fruits of the jungle that are available all the year round, the Onge luckily ignore the simple method of distilling alcohol. No intoxicating drink reaches Little Andaman from the outer world, whereas in Great Andaman alcohol, together with imported syphilis, was one of the main causes of depopulation. No syphilis appears as yet to have reached Little Andaman.

Thomas and Scott based their conclusions partly on the views of Johnston and Pitman and partly on a traditional legend which they unfortunately misunderstood. The inhabitants of Kyaggwe believe that the dwarfness of the Banakalanga is a disease caused by the Mbwa fly ( Simulium damnosum Theo ) or by the river god, or by a combination of both. The Kiganda legend regarding the Banakalanga is authentic in so far as it suggests pathological causes and implicitly speaks against any ethnological origins for the stunted growth of the Banakalanga. 4 Banakalanga derives from the verb okulanga, to grow thin.

The illness is said to be brought by eating the bird, it having been put in the food by an enemy. Sleeping is said to be a function of the heart, not the head, which continues the work of dreaming during sleep. This illness is said therefore to affect the heart.

What comes from the dead protects against death and the dead, just as the demon masks influence the demons. And the stones have many connections to the dead. The ancient forebears were once stone people or changed themselves into stones after death, so the little stones and stone beads used for this mostly come then from the old graves of the coast, from which the Kágaba themselves get them, if they do not perhaps buy them from the Colombians. My whole supply of these magic stones came from the Colombians; the Kágaba, however, had specific names for all of them, and for them themselves their own were not for sale. Finally, the stones were also puma-like creatures and as such brought sicknesses (see pp. 121 ff.). But the little magic stones could do much more than just cure sickness and give protection from it.

       "  \"The Inuit response to these improved medical services has been extremely positive. The nurses report that, at least in Holman, residents are conscientious in attending clinics and responsible in abiding by the nurse's advice when sick. Now that housing conditions have improved and people are spending more of their time in the settlement, most homes are clean and neatly maintained. Consequently, the squalor that was prevalent in the early settlement period has virtually disappeared. There are, however, a number of health problems that remain chronic with the local Inuit population: 1) Ear Disorders--Despite the inroads that have been made in other areas of Inuit health, ear infections, most notably otitis media, have become increasingly common among the younger members of the population. A disproportionate number of children have had serious infections resulting in partial loss of hearing. In the past 10 years, it has been quite common to send children out of the settlement for various kinds of ear surgery, such as tympanoplasties and myringotomies. Many adults have also suffered varying degrees of hearing loss as a result of overexposure to snowmobile engines, outboard motors, and high-powered rifles. 2) Dental Health--Dentists who have worked in the settlement universally comment on the abysmal state of teeth and gums, especially among Inuit children. The incidence of dental caries, abscessed teeth, and peridontal disease is exceptionally high and primarily attributed to poor dental hygiene and the high consumption of sugars in the form of candy and soft drinks. It is not uncommon to find teenagers who have had one or more fully decayed teeth pulled out. Although many adults and children have toothbrushes in their homes, the daily brushing of teeth is a rare occurrence. 3) Attitude towards Infectious Disease--Even though most individuals are aware that many diseases are transmitted from one person to another, practices involving the isolation and containment of sick individuals are seldom followed. Social visitation is rarely curtailed if an individual is indisposed. Children are the most flagrant violators of this simple rule of preventative medicine. Since most parents have little direct control over their children, it is difficult for them to keep children contained in their homes for any length of time. Interestingly enough, one teacher noted that many children intentionally attend school when they are sick in order to get attention from teachers and other children. For these reasons, a contagious disease that enters the settlement will inevitably incapacitate a large number of residents and will even go around several times before disappearing altogether. 4) Alcohol Consumption--Deaths from accidents, injuries, and violence are the leading causes of mortality throughout the N.W.T. An unusually large proportion of these are alcohol related. Although Holman does not yet have the same alcohol-related problems as other, larger settlements, the degree of alcohol consumption is definitely on the upswing. Many local residents, drinkers as well as nondrinkers, frequently comment that much more alcohol is being consumed now than in the recent past. With this increase has come a concomitant rise in alcohol-related accidents and violence. More detail on the nature of alcohol consumption is given in a later chapter. 5) Other Health Problems--Other health problems that are on the increase are such things as obesity, acne, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and myopia. Since most of these are related to changing nutritional patterns, they are discussed in the following section.\",\n",

Krogman 313 Krogman, 1939, p. 12; Ronhaar, 1930, passim . Without having examined the physical evidence which might prove this contention, I believe on other evidence (such as the frequent and severe migraine of the Aymara) that a very plausible case might be made also for the alternative purpose. There is every reason to believe, however, that both motives could have operated. In this connection it is interesting to recall the legend, reported by Vara Cadillo, of the Ichik Ol'qo or child-demon, which inhabits waterfalls and foundtains, growling angrily, and throwing out a rainbow from his navel, by which he exerts an evil influence upon men through the crowns of their heads. Note also the Aymara belief in a vampire-head which sucks blood from the occipital region. considers that the purpose of trephining was to relieve compression fractures of the skull caused by warclubs, but Ronhaar believes that trephining was performed most often for epilepsy or migraine (if the epilepsy were traumatic, it comes to the same thing). Trepanation was done by sawing, cutting, scraping, and drilling with chips of flint, obsidian, quartz, and possibly blades of copper. A gourd, shell, or plaque of silver controlled the herniation of the brain through the operation. Similar is the bleeding performed upon the root of the nose, although this may have been to relieve the swelling in this area caused by a disease called “Gundu.” Another surgical procedure was to tie off multiple lipomata with horse-hairs until they sloughed off.\",\n",

       "  'The cure of a case of spirit possession is accomplished by a method curiously similar to that used in psychoanalysis. The Lauan theory is that the doctor must draw a confession of the name of the spirit from the patient in order to release the spirit from his body. The doctor sees the patient every day, tries to allay his fears, encourages him, talks to him about the spirit, gives him potions of herbs to drink, and rubs his body with medicines. Finally in the course of the treatment, when the doctor touches the part of the body in which the spirit dwells, the patient will cry out.

Immediately the spirit leaves him and he begins to recover.',\n",

       "  \"We finally arrived. Before our eyes were a beautiful beach and the majestic river. We lay down, very tired, on that white and soft sand and rested a little ... The sun was about to set ... We needed to think of wood for the night fire ... It was probable that some ounce would want to pay us an unwanted visit: the fire would protect us and give us the coals for roasting the fish. We told the Indians that they should immediately take care of the fishing: they were masters at that; we would go to look for firewood... So it was done: our job was very easy: firewood is not lacking in the thicket; we piled up enough and afterwards remained watching the Indians with their lines cast into the dark-green waters of the river ... By the movement of the lines, held surely in the Indians' hands, one could see perfectly that the fish were abundant and that they were biting constantly. In those moments the superattention of the sylvicolists was remarkable ... Suddenly, a line becomes taut; the Indian, alert, gives the pull of a master; the fish is caught on the hook. The savage makes a Herculean effort to conquer the resistance which the fish puts up against being brought to the surface. All of us, curious, were waiting for the last pull which would put the fish on dry land ... At the instant when the flattened head of the fish emerged a few meters from the beach, the Indian, unexpectedly, lets go of the line, makes a jump backwards, turns his back to the river, runs a few 118 cont. steps in toward the beach, and remains motionless, covering his face with his hands ... The scene was so fast that, when we saw it, everything had already happened: the fish had gone away with the entire line. The other Indians gathered up their fishhooks, which they had in their hands, and, without saying a word, went to lie down near the fire. Disturbed, even more impressed by what we had witnessed, we asked the why of such great and harmful extravagance. After a few moments, as if not to seem ill-mannered, they answered quite low, barely to be heard: “ bope (spirit of the evil) Kidokia, pirarara (smooth-skinned fish of the nature of the jaú /Paulicea lutkeni/.

       "  'Informants report experiencing a variety of sensed states as a disease process begins. Among these are depression (mental), cough, dry throat, diarrhea, fever, vomiting, stomach ache, loss of appetite, swelling, headache. At this stage in the disease process, no one, least of all the patient, knows what developments of successive units of time will be like. That is, the patient may have a headache and it will disappear (that is, no longer be reported) in some successive unit of time. On the other hand, the headache may be compounded with a stomach ache in some successive unit of time, resulting in a redefinition of the disease process. Generally speaking, sensed states which occur early in the disease process and which are not divisible into other sensed states are equivalent to symptoms , whereas sensed states which occur later in the disease process and which are a sum of other sensed states may be equivalent to illnesses . Illnesses are unit characterizations of the disease process which are sufficiently contrastive with each other so that alternative strategies for reducing the illness (as a basis of inference and action) are pursued, depending upon which (identified) illness is present in any particular case.',\n",

The delirium and hysterical accompaniment of some kinds of sickness are generally regarded as supernatural, but more as glimpses into the future life than as the occasions in which powers are conferred. We do, however, recall a few cases in which sick men claim to have received such powers; but none of the more important rituals are assigned to such origins. The attitude toward alcoholic intoxication is uncertain because there seems to have been a gradual moral awakening to its evil effects, which may account for the present tendency to consider experiences so induced as of no particular consequence.

       "  \"It is unquestionably true that the Aymara deeply fear the dead and the circumstances surrounding death. Paredes' belief that these attitudes result from missionary teaching is almost certainly incorrect. 3 Paredes, 1936, 228-229. Far from being so uncomplicated, the explanation of this fear of the dead is complex, and several component beliefs must be considered independently. First, the corpse itself, as well as associated objects, is thought to be a potential source of a certain disease, orixa , to which children are particularly susceptible. Second, all ghosts of adults, irrespective of the dispositions of their former earthly counterparts, are naturally malevolent, and may send disease or, according to folk tales, cause death in other ways. 4 Informants were undecided as to whether or not children produced ghosts; at any rate, the ghosts of children (if they exist) are not feared (11, 43). Finally, the souls of the dead, either out of sheer jealousy of the living, or because of loneliness, frequently attempt to drag relatives and friends along with them to the hereafter. 1 As is shown below, it is close relatives who are most apt to be harmed by the dead. Similarly, it should be noted, in cases of sorcery the first suspicion of guilt falls upon close relatives. Indeed, as lias been demonstrated, the Aymara today is forced to compete for his very livelihood with his close relatives. It seems possible, therefore, to regard this fear of corpses, ghosts, and souls in part as a projection of repressed hostility towards parents and near relatives into the realm of the dead. This is especially true of the souls of children, and many omens are interpreted to mean that the deceased child desires the death of a sibling. 2 Perhaps this belief is to be understood as a projection of sibling rivalry, a phenomenon of which the Aymara themselves are well aware. There is, on the contrary, no evidence whatever from Chucuito to indicate that the dead ever seek to benefit the living (except to warn them of impending disaster) or that souls are regarded as guardians or protectors. 3 Paredes writes that the souls of the dead are believed to watch over and protect their relatives and the community as a whole; while they never abandon their kinsmen, these souls may punish the living if they deserve it. Paredes, 1946, 211-212. Indeed, the return of the souls during All Saints fiesta in November is believed to prevent rain when it is most meeded and the exposed bones of the dead are thought to cause drought (2). It is also desirable to slaughter livestock for meat before All Souls day, since the returning souls are said to steal the fat of these animals (43).\",\n",

He is the ultimate focus of causation, the ultimate source of life: men, for instance, ‘beget’ children, but God ‘creates’ them. Sickness and health, ill-fortune and good, exist only with His consent and are ultimately in his control to withhold or bestow. Luck ( nassiib ) is in the gift of God; and although magico-religious procedures are resorted to to remove sickness or to palliate it, misfortune and illness are rarely ascribed to the action of sorcery or witchcraft.

The shorn hair is tossed into the thorn fence of the kraal. Beard hair and such lashes that grow back into the eye are plucked out with tweezers (Fig. 63 [ ol bud et ]). An exception to this is made by the men of the El kiboron lineage, who are not permitted to pluck out their beard hair because otherwise they would lose their power, in particular the supernatural one that enables them to bring and to conjure away rain. 147 cont. Axillary hair 148 and eyebrows are shaved. Women also shave the pubic hair, whereas men pluck it out with the fingers or tweezers. Young warriors let the hair grow and, when it has the necessary length, twist it between two fingers, through which apparently arise little balls, which, on closer inspection, prove to be spirals interlaced and rolled together. Somewhat later it is twisted together into strands ( ol babet, el babet ) with red paint, a mixture of animal fat and red earth, which hang entangled around the head. Furthermore they are lengthened by twisting in fibers of the bark of the baobab ( ol m es er a ) and of another tree called ol retéti , in order to form out of that the braid-coiffure peculiar to the Masai warriors, but adopted by many neighboring tribes (Fig. 64, 65, 66 [ ol daiga, el daigan ]). For this the hair is parted crosswise over the head from ear to ear, and then that of the front half of the head is divided into three parts, one over the forehead, the other two at the 148 cont. temples, whereupon the tips of the strands are wrapped with bast to the length of an inch. The back hair, lengthened up to 50 centimeters, is placed around a foot-long stick and on this wrapped tightly with bast or goat leather scraped thin, so that it forms a stiff braid ( ol daiga ) reaching to the waist. Over this braid one not infrequently finds one to three smaller ones. Often the tips of the little temple braids (sing. ol babeda; el babed l e n goscho ) are joined with that of the little forehead braid ( ol babeda l e n gomum ) and the former tied together under the chin with a string (made of fibers) 1 This hair style has the purpose of protecting the head from the harmful influences of the sun's rays. For that, one first let the hair grow long and, since the long strands fell annoyingly into the face at every movement, put it together into “braids.” The Tatoga helped themselves more simply, in that they shaved the front part of the head and left the protection of the thick padding of hair at the back part of the head. .

The point, of course, is that the layman uses simple magic against a manageable nonhuman adversary, whereas the medicine man is called in to pit himself against a formidable human adversary.

       "  'The principal cultural mechanism for any economic, social, or religious activity is priestly divination. Divinatory techniques are many and consist of simple yes-or-no alternatives, but often take the form of complex interpretations of signs and symbols, such as the reading of cloud formations, animal voices, or the shape and number of air bubbles rising from a tubular necklace bead which has been submerged in water. Other mechanisms are muscle twitching, deep meditation, and the listening to sudden sounds or voices from within. Divination is practised mainly to ascertain whether or not a certain action is fesible. The decision may concern the planting of a crop, the clearing of a field, or any aspect of a wide range of major or minor alternatives of resource management, housing, family affairs, travel, trade, or other activities. People must continually consult these priestly oracles in order to have their actions guided by divination; should they disregard these rules, symptoms of illness will soon come to express the displeasure of the divine forces and the priests will impose penalties which, occasionally, can be very harsh. Priestly divination undoubtedly introduces a random element (Moore, 1965) but much of it appears to be manipulated and the final decision most often represents a personal choice made by the priest. This is almost always the case in matters of mate selection; in agricultural and general subsistence decision making, divination is an effective device in ecological planning because the priest’s practical environmental knowledge is truly outstanding. Priestly divinations provide guidance not only for small-scale decisions in daily life but may determine major strategies such as the foundation or relocation of settlements, the intensification of a certain crop, or the nature of trade relationships with neighbouring creole settlers. The effectiveness of this, to a large degree, ritually controlled agro-ecosystem (Rappaport, 1969) is recognized by most Kogi Indians. In fact, the underlying reason why Kogi culture has been able to resist harmful change, is that it gives a strong backing to priestly authority.',\n",

As the husband of the Tafua goddess Nau Fiora ( op. cit ., p. 123), he was adjured to furnish a material contribution in the form of a shark or other large fish. The Ariki Tafua identified Feke with the sun and said that he invoked the god also under the title of the Sacred Ray (Kaveitapu).

Pae Sao told me that the title used by the Ariki Fangarere was Black Ray (Kaveiuri), and by Pa Fenumera of Fangarere I was told that Te Urungaru (ordinary term for headache) was a title for Feke used by a former chief of that clan. The Ariki Taumako, who did not invoke Feke in his normal kava, did so, however, when he performed the kava in Niukapu, a lineage offshoot from the chiefly lineage of Taumako, which had settled in Faea long ago. Pa Niukapu explained to me in 1929 that since the autochthonous Nga Faea had been expelled ( History and Traditions of Tikopia , pp. 136 et seq .) their deities were invoked and appeased in the kava of his lineage lest people be devoured by them in revenge: ‘lest we be eaten by the atua , exasperated because of their men who were slain’. By ‘eaten’ he meant afflicted with illness and death. So when the kava formula was recited the deities of Nga Faea were invoked first and those of Taumako subsequently. The first title ‘lifted’ was Feke, then came Taukaveivaru, which he said was a collective term for the rays of Feke. ‘His rays are gathered together and are made his sons, eight rays collectively.’ This explanation reconciled to some extent the discrepancy noted earlier whereby various elders translated titles such as Kaveitoto as being the names of other deities than Feke. Pa Niukapu said that a famous ancestor of his, a noted sea voyager ( Work of the Gods , p. 377), had gone at his death to Nukutureki, a dwelling of Feke beneath the ocean, and that this name formerly had been applied to an open space near his house (where later the church of St Mary stood).

       "  \"The “magic” of protection is much more limited in its practitioners. On the one hand, there are those who have a specific status entitlement -- ritual elders of lineages ( matapure ) and especially chiefs of clans ( ariki ) -- to care for the welfare of their group members. But while Tikopia is rigid in its adherence to the principle of patrilineal descent, it does not confine spiritual benefits so closely, and custom allows help to be obtained by resort to another than one's own lineage or clan head. (This custom has an advantage in that it is part of the mechanism of organization in practice and theory to deal with failure.) On the other hand, “magic” of protection can also be performed by persons of another social category, the spirit mediums ( vaka atua ). For practice in this capacity no particular status is required, only the ability to enter a state of dissociation and give the appropriate social responses. Here is an opportunity for women. No woman can be a chief or a ritual elder, 6 The status of “Female chief” -- Ariki fafine, is a special one, with social functions, and ritual significance, but without the political control and ritual duties of the normal male chief. but it is not uncommon for women, of ordinary as well as chiefly families, to be spirit mediums. Nor is this thought abnormal, or disapproved of, and they attend male as well as female patients. The “magical” procedures of protection and healing are more highly specialized and individualized than those of production. Much of them is common knowledge in the society at large, but the practitioners are regarded as having the special entitlement by status or capacity which secures them from imitation. No-one would use a procedure he had just “picked up”, as he might with some “magic” of production. There is a higher degree of esoteric conten', a greater degree of systematization, a more complete “performance”.\",\n",

The shaman then has to extract the object, which he does by the aid of his familiar spirits. To prove his success he displays to his audiences pieces of bone, or worms, or similar things that he has secreted on his person before-hand. The laxatives that we occasionally administered answered the same purpose. Both sickness and ill-luck can be embodied in physical objects and carried away. Haviuyak had a boil on his arm which he pricked with a needle as soon as it came to a head, squeezing the pus on to a piece of caribou meat. He asked me to let him give it to Scotty, the biggest dog in my team, who would carry the contagion away with him when I left. One of his own dogs snatched at the meat, but he kicked it away and anxiously watched till the whole morsel had disappeared down Scotty's throat. To propitiate the dog he tied a band of white deerskin round its neck. Some days later he was asked how the boil was progressing, and answered, ‘It has all disappeared, thanks to the dog.’ Another Eskimo, Kaiyoranna, made me a present of two bone pins fastened to the outside of a small deerskin bag. I wanted to look inside the bag, but he checked me and tried to draw my attention to the fine workmanship in the pins. Later, after I had left the camp, I found only four old scraps of skin in the bag. I showed it to some of the natives, and they explained that Kaiyoranna had fastened some one's illness or ill-luck in the bag, and added the pins as a bribe to induce me to take it away.”\",\n",

The message in folk-terms is more concrete, compact, and familiar to the client, and thus is more easily understood and accepted. Although the interpretation may be “supernatural” and not “rational” from a modern scientific point of view, it is more meaningful and useful to the client. Also, there is psychological significance in citing a supernatural power as the cause of the client's problem. A devil or a ghost can merely be the external aspect of any person in a real-life situation. However, such an interpretation is more easily tolerated and accepted by people who live in a society where close relationships between family members are maintained and overt conflict between persons is prohibited.

       "  'However, in the Hubeer case, the category of the wild and unknown is not found in the boundary between otherwise unambiguous categories, as suggested by the theories of Douglas (1966) and Leach (1964). Rather, the ambiguous is defined as an inherent part of the world view where it opposes concepts of the familiar and known. The duur (bush) is both the domain of wild animals and of health restoring plants. Plants themselves can be used for malicious as well as healing purposes. Similarly, the system of cosmic correspondences suggested in the therapies based on the Sufi traditions, have the character of truths which have been hidden in the world by God. Strangers, although they may be potential enemies are also those with the most powerful medicines. Whether it is dressed in the shape of social, spatial or temporal categories, the contrast between the familiar and the unknown pervades Somali culture, and the power of the unknown is not restricted to contexts of healing. Hypothetically, it could be suggested that “the incorporation of the unknown” for healing purposes parallels the incorporation of strangers into southern Somali clans. Strangers, shisheeye, no matter how ambiguous they may appear, are a resource that adds to the numbers and prestige of the adopting lineage. The suggestion of such an analogy, if further substantitated, could help to account for the differences between southern Somali medicine and some other African medical traditions that I have pointed to above.',\n",

(62) Among the Selk'nam there is a well-developed “social welfare,” which attends to not only orphans and the sick, but also widowed and needy persons. This has already been confirmed (p. 680). For illustration I add an observation by Spegazzini (a):175, who remembers a very old man who was accompanied everywhere by his grandson. The life of the individual person stood and stands in special estimation among those around him, which is why atonement is always demanded for a murder and harsh revenge is taken (p. 629). If an inveterate thief (p. 622) or a person who betrayed the Kloketen secret (p. 1273) was murdered, the generality consented to it, with a view toward warding off greater harm. Suicide seems never to have been practiced (p. 686). (63) Cf. Gallardo:133. Calvi:51 writes very generally: “Gli Ona considerano mancanze gravi l'omicidio volontario, escluso, ben inteso, quello commesso in guerra /The Ona consider voluntary manslaughter a grave offense, except, of course, that committed in war/.” Precisely like life itself, one also prized health and, if necessary, reached for remedies . Feuerland /Tierra del Fuego/ offers only very few of these; true medicinal plants are lacking altogether, (64) The fact that medicinal herbs and minerals are not present at all on the Great Island is shown by a study of the country and its flora and fauna. Dabbene (b):260, Del Turco (BS; 1904), Gallardo: 302, and others expressly confirm this. Only Holmberg (a):59 mistakenly and without specific references speaks of “ramas de plantas medicinales /branches of medicinal plants/.” Just like European pleasures, for “they have a horror of tobacco or other druggs / sic /” /quoted in English/ (Barclay [a]:74), they also reject medicines, which usually taste bitter and for that reason alone do not please them (p. 1068). and the Selk'nam as well as the Haus make do with other things.

       "  \"3. Before the coming of the Japanese, there were no plague-like diseases on Taiwan, but recently a number of people have died from this kind of diseases. This is the punishment of the god Kuan Kung. For this reason as Japanese become more numerous, the Taiwanese become fewer in number. There is a direct relationship in the number of deaths of Taiwanese and the number of Japanese on the island. This is because Kuan Kung hates the Japanese. This being the case, Taiwanese must not on any account fraternize with Japanese. This kind of ignorant nonsense of course has not one iota of value, but the stupid common people can be affected by such empty words and their hearts moved. Accordingly let us make a more thorough investigation of the manner in which the spirit writing cult was propagated. It is certain that the most frenzied activity was in Taichung province. From about April of 1902, the cult overran Miao-Li , Tung-Shih , Chang-Hwa Lu-Kang , Pei-T'ou , Pei-Kang , etc. By mid-June it had penetrated to the area of the north of Tainan, i.e. Chia-Yi . Officials earnestly discussed measures to stem the tide, but there was no easy way to do this. By the end of July the cult had reached as far as Ma-Tou (near Tainan). At this time the police office in Ma-Tou forbid the spirit writing cult to meet. By making the utmost efforts, the officials were able to dampen the movement a little. From then on the southern penetration of the cult began to slacken. It was not until August or September that the cult reached the southern end of the island. When it entered the Heng-Chun district, its fury was visibly less, and the bad effects comparatively lighter. But in the Pescadores, a strong impulse emanated from the Tainan area. Gaining the endorsement of several sympathizers, the cult was established in the temples of the fortress of MaKung. On the basis of its reputation for curing opium addicts, a great number of addicts assembled there and before the gods made a vow to quit the habit. Daily the number of pilgrims grew more numerous, but suppression was so effective that by the end of August 1902, the cult had practically ceased activity.

       "  'There is a further conclusion to be drawn here that is somewhat surprising. It is often demonstrated that African medical therapy looks at the whole of the patient and his social situation. An abnormal symptom is referred back to social relations in the immediate environment and the therapy is aimed at restoring these relations to a normal condition (see e.g. Ayoade 1979; Conco 1979; Dawson 1979). Famous, too, is Evans-Pritchard’s example of how the Zande choose to regard only domestic plants as materia medica (1937: 448). Even where this may not be directly the case, healing is “in any event, organically bound up with basic political and economic processes” (Feierman 1985:116), thus echoing what the same author calls “the social roots of health and healing”. Certainly such trends can also be traced in Somali medical practices, but as we have seen here a dominant trend is not to seek for remedies in the familiar and mundane. 9 . Some such techniques that seek to relate the affliction of the person to social relational problems seem to be less concerned with the healing as such and are better thought of as “divination”. This applies to, for instance, the fal or soothsaying (cf. fallow, “soothsayer”) which is obviously what Antoniotti has in mind when he writes “at the beginning of every therapy, the sick person must recognize the source of the illness” (1984:160). Rather, it is by drawing upon the explicitly wild, the strange and the unknown that one attempts to restore health. Significantly, Tresalti reports from a village in southern Somalia that the absence of privacy at modern clinics inhibits many people from choosing that type of therapy (1984:205). This suggests that healing may be regarded as something inherently private, something which deliberately should be concealed from the eyes of the public.',\n",
       "  \"Thus, for example, each of the years in the sixty year cycle is supposed to be controlled by a heavenly bureaucrat, the “god of the year” ( Thai-soe ). In the case described above it could be said that one or more of the victim's eight characters anger the god of the year who then dispatches ghosts to afflict the victim. The naturalistic interpretation offers grounds for prescribing medical treatments by means of traditional herbal remedies. The explanation in terms of angry spirits opens the possibility of ritual curing. An angry god of the year, for example, can be propitiated or the ghosts he sends to afflict his victim can either be bribed or otherwise forced to leave the victim alone.\",\n",
       "  'Agressions against strangers, however, are not punished and instead are regarded as suitable conduct. The lack of economic collaboration is severely punished in the following situations: husband-wife, parents-children, sons-in-law -- fathers-in-law, but it is considered a minor offense when other combinations between persons or families are involved. Lies or defamations are generally regarded as examples of diplomacy and justified caution, but are not offenses properly speaking. Unadapted individuals, or those who conduct themselves in an unusual or extravagant manner in the culture, are not considered as offenders, but are fully responsible in case of a direct infraction. Malevolent magic does not exist as an aggressive action. Offenses against property are always interpreted in terms of food and are punished severely whenever it is a question of thefts of foodstuffs, fruits, or domestic animals. Thefts of utilitarian objects occur frequently, but are considered of less importance. The principal political offense is treason. An individual may be accused of treason if he maintains friendly contacts with strangers who are not natives and communicates religious knowledge to them or takes them to sacred sites or gives them ceremonial objects. In these cases they may go as far as capital punishment. Sexual offenses include masturbation, prenuptial sexuality, adultery, incest, homosexuality, contacts with animals, and obscene language. Coitus must be done in 146 certain places, intervals, and positions; and certain personal rites must be observed in relation with it. Religious offenses, finally, include innumerable actions, and ultimately every offense, no matter what it is, is interpreted in religious terms, especially if it is a matter of negligence in offerings and personal rites, in rites of purification, fasts, diet, and sexual abstinence. The concept of immunity does not exist for any person. Suicide is considered a social and religious offense, since the individual is thus trying to escape from his responsibilities. Offenses are brought to public knowledge through direct accusation by the person offended, occasionally assisted by members of his family, without their necessarily being affected by the offense. Public opinion can similarly exercise sufficient pressure to bring a collective accusation before the authority. Another means of ascertainment would be the confession of the delinquent, which in serious cases may obligatorily be repeated in public. The Kogi do not only consider evident acts as offenses, but also thoughts and intentions. Thinking about adultery is as serious as the consummated act, and the individual who thought about stealing a yuca is as guilty as if he had in fact stolen it. These thoughts, like all offenses, must be confessed periodically to the máma, and, in order that this confession be truthful and detailed, he has the backing of supernatural punishment with illnesses. The Kógi have a great fear of sickness and death and are concerned daily about possible pathological symptoms. Thus confession is really an extremely efficient means of control, since the eventual punishment will not be carried out in some remote beyond, but immediately. After having fasted, spent the night awake, and confessed for hours, the individual, very understandably, will feel a headache. This ache is immediately interpreted as a punishment for not having confessed well, and the same individual will go back again to the máma to repeat his confession and to scrutinize his mind, trying to remember the slightast offenses, in order to communicate them to the máma and thus free himself of all evil. Thus the máma, by means of confession, can ascertain all of the offenses which they commit, committed, or intend to commit in his town. Nonetheless, an individual can never be accused by means of divination, and it can only be applied to a collectivity. A máma could punish an entire town 147 with fasts, offerings, or other abstinences, if he divined that the collective conduct was not suitable.',\n",

At times these bindings contain little black beads, and the Máma also gives the father some little dry seeds which are pierced so that they may later be put around the baby’s neck in the form of a small necklace. The baby is given a small totuma /vessel made out of the fruit of Crescentia cujete / containing sugar-cane water to drink, and with this act the “baptism” is considered ended.

Good speech only is made to her. The basis of the father's sister is the father. I do not speak evilly to my father, nor do I speak evilly to his sister, my aunt. I again do not speak evilly to the child of my father's sister. It is done in this fashion because she is of weight. Should I speak evilly to my father and my father's sister, when my father's sister dies, and I have spoken evilly to her, then it reacts and I become ill. That is its basis. The oven is fired, and when her oven-firing (final rite for the dead) is finished, the father's sister goes then to her ancestors and returns hither again to bring sickness upon her child who spoke evilly.”\",\n",

       "  'In principle, an illness is imagined as a wrapping, a thin black cape that envelops the patient and must be broken in some manner to accomplish the cure. Obviously, this cape represents the placenta, and the sick person himself is compared with a foetus. An effective cure consists then in producing a birth. What is sought is to rupture the envelope and to reincorporate the patient into normal life. There is one single word — mahsári —meaning to cure and to be born. Moreover, it is believed that, in order to produce a rebirth, it is necessary in many cases to symbolically effect coitus with the patient, an act which introduces into his organism an element of vitality and growth. These two concepts, that of the patient conceived as a foetus and that of the cure as a birth produced by a new coitus, are based on the underlying assumption that the illness itself was caused by a sexual act, a kind of contagious insemination. The sex of the sick person is not taken into account under these circumstances for it is believed that all sick people have an essentially feminine character. It is interesting to observe that the Desana do not have a fixed concept of time but one that can be manipulated, accelerated or retarded, in combination with the rupture of levels of perception.',\n",

In both examples the patient brings up the notion of wind ( hông ). Hông, as used by laymen, sometimes refers to moving air -- air that can make a baby that is inadequately covered fall sick. At other times hông refers to a substance that can get trapped inside the baby when a bone is broken or when arthritis is contracted. The term hông is also frequently used by Chinese-style doctors and they would probably have responded positively to the patients' use of it in the examples above. The Western-style doctors, however, say that hông is “not important” or that it does not cause arthritis. Similarly, the woman in example (4) asks whether her son can drink juice, probably out of concern that the juice will be incompatible with either the medicine or the illness. But the doctor evades her question in order to encourage her to feed the child normally. Patient and doctor talk past each other, the one bringing ideas unacceptable to the other, neither able to establish a common conceptual ground.\",\n",

The following considerations, however, seem to have been important in influencing the kings’ decisions. Superstition regarding the king’s health played a large part. If a king lived in a capital where he frequently fell ill, he would build a new capital at the advice of the medicine men or of the gods or of his chiefs or of his own accord. Kings Tebandeke, Kamaanya and Mutesa I’s illnesses may be quoted as examples. King Kyabaggu’s decision to settle in Busoga was partly influenced by his belief that there was a ghost in Buganda which tormented him. “Let my sons take over the kingdom” he said; “myself I shall stay in Busoga. I will not return to the country where there is a ghost which wants to kill me.” Sometimes, a king would change his capital for strategic considerations. He might choose a site near the lake because he wanted an easy route of escape in case of mortal danger. King Kiggala’s settlement at Bugungu may be cited as an interesting example.',\n",

For the view of the Kágaba is that in cohabitation the male organ devours the secretion of the female. “Now the member (kalguákala) of Matuna devoured (arzá) the sexual organ (hakulue) ( 2 . Literally: female hill = mound of Venus. ) of the wife of Songela ” runs the description of a cohabitation ( 11, 10). 121 But the general designation gazahi, gaitsahi (to practice cohabitation), expresses the process more clearly, for the literal translation says: to eat excrement, from gai, ga (excrement) and zahi (to eat). Cf. also gai-misi, ga-misi (to make excrement) and huízi misi (to make urine). That is why the female sex organ is also called gaimiskuí (that which makes excrement) or sotá (= sautá ) [the eating, the food]). Gahi and zahi (to eat), however, are synonomous words, so that gaulí = saulí is the male member, and gaulí gúi, to make into a male member or to make procreative or fruitful. Thus one says of a christened Kágaba in a personal construction, gaulí agakuane (he is christened), or, in the contrary case, gauli agakuagele (he is not yet christened). Now it is also explicable that one of the five stones that are used for the newborn child is called guikuitsi (stone to make [procreative]) and that each of the other packets must be touched with the packet of powder from this stone. When all the stone powder is strewn onto the graves of the grandparents and great-grandparents, it is likewise desired to prevent sickness with this, just as in other cases other stone powder on the graves of the grandparents is supposed to ward off sickness.',\n",

Sometimes it is extremely expansible and can be stretched into a very long thread, like a strip of rubber, approximately to the breadth of an arm-span. Occasionally I heard: “The kwáke hurled toward a certain person by a n is like an arrow point. This penetrates into the body. It settles in a certain spot and grows so that the person feels pain. In the body it usually acts like a living animal, like a cururo, rat, or beetle, like a lizard, dog, or young bird.

       "  'With these same directions are associated the winds, and with these in turn definite colors and attributes, which are also associated with rain showers ( 1 . The Kógi say: “There are rain showers of every color, but the color is not visible. The dark showers are bad. At the end of the World, showers of all colors will fall, and then they will be visible.” ). The wind from the East is white and good; the wind from the West is black and bad; the wind from the North is blue and bad, and the wind from the South is red and may be good or bad. These winds are imagined as women wearing long skirts, who come dancing from the four directions where they have their homes, each bringing certain gifts. Thus the wind from the East “brings good,” the wind from the West “brings evil,” the wind from the North “brings sickness,” and the wind from the South “brings the heat.” These qualities, the good, the bad, sickness, and heat, are thought of as substances, and, in fact, it is said that these substances cling to the clothing of the four women and spread from them like “seeds.” The winds thus have the character of fertilizing forces in a benign and malignant sense. There are many mythical examples which express this concept. Thus, for example, Búnkua-se blows on Kashindúkua, when the latter falls unconscious, and makes him revive; then he blows upon the bones of Kashindúkua and again resuscitates him. Tamiséi blows upon the bones of Sekuishbúchi and revives them; the breeze blows on Duginávi, the solar hero, when he comes forth, unconscious, from the sea monster and brings him to life. In the myth concerning the creation of the first man, it is said of the Universal Mother: Blowing, she gave him life.” But this same blowing can also be a defensive action: Sangaraména blows into the eye of his enemy Matúna and converts him into a blue ball; the máma who protected Námaku blows against the attacking enemies and transforms them into fruits of the field, which Námaku eats ( 1 . Cf. the myths of Kashindúkua, Námaku, Sekuishbúchi, and Duginávi /see 2: Reichel-Dolmatoff in this file/. ). “To blow” sometimes has the direct meaning of “to sow.” The fine mineral dust of which many offerings consist and which represents “seed” is sometimes placed on the hand and blown into the air, either so that it will penetrate in a certain direction or so that it will impregnate the soil of a certain place. The lime powder which is mixed with the 252 coca is similarly blown into the air in order to attract rain ( 2 . Cf. “Religion,” offerings. ). All sickness is regarded as having been brought by the winds, and it is especially the humid wind from the sea, the “blue wind,” which is considered the most dangerous of all. The association of the directions with good or bad events is similarly expressed in various myths. In the creation myth it is said that the “End of the World” lies beyond the Magdalena River, in the West. Aldauhuíku, a culture hero, came from the East. In the West lived the evil Ubatáshi and other mythical tribes who were considered to be endowed with evil magical powers. In the myth of Duginávi it is said that his body was carried to Guajira where it was buried, and, of course, seen from the Kógi habitat, Guajira is the place where the sun is reborn each day.',\n",

For snake bites in general, they drink the sap of a cipo called P ï rõ-dá (snake cipo), with a thick stem and abundant and pleasing sap, which they likewise use to quench their thirst when walking through the forest. In spite of these remedies of theirs, every year there is a certain number of victims of the snakes, and if this number is not larger they owe it to the remedies and serums obtained from the Mission. c) For toothache . They use a plant that burns like pepper, Pixkõ-kó , remedy-for-teeth. They burn the leaves and apply the ashes to the aching tooth. d) For sore eyes . 1st. If it is a matter of children, they scrape the bark of the minhoca cipo, Ahwã-da , leave it in infusion in mother’s milk or, lacking this, in water, and afterwards they put some drops in the ailing eye, using a small funnel made out of arumã leaf.

First, then, the baby must be prepared ritually. Morning and evening ritual washing will continue for forty days, three days after birth the tribal marks are incised and the uvula removed, and seven days after birth, when the child is given its name, a Malam intercedes with Allah and asks him to protect it, while the maternal and paternal lineages express their goodwill towards it. Beyond this the parents will usually provide a number of charms to be worn round the baby’s neck or loins, but the number and kind is not rigidly prescribed. Next, the baby must be prepared physically, that is, it must be given enough food to ensure its growth, it must be given appropriate treatment if it is ill, and it must be protected from physical harm. After the first few weeks it will also receive its first training leading to sphincter control by being held in the proper position for defaecation. There is no attempt at super-ego formation during this period, there is no aura of “good” or “bad” either explicit or implied, and the emphasis is on the skill of the adult in so arranging things that only the desired results are obtained.

One explanation which I was given for the introduction of the disease into Somaliland, where, in one form it is known as Abyssinian saar ( saar Habaashi ), was that the Ethiopians had sent it in retaliation for the many past acts of aggression of Somali against them. In Somaliland there is a fairly well-developed ritual of exorcism conducted mainly by women who have previously suffered from the disease who are considered to have ‘authority’ over the spirit. Such a woman is called alaqa . The exorcism of the spirit—which may not be permanent—and the treatment of the disease are usually conducted by these women who charge very considerable fees. The saar spirit is held to like all good things; all luxuries, perfumes, fine clothes, dates, coffee etc., and livestock are sometimes also killed so that blood may be given to appease the spirit. While the alaqa takes the majority of these as her reward the patient has also to be given presents, these being given in the name of the spirit possessing her.',\n",
       "  \"After the naming prayers are made, usually by the hposil , in front of the family altar which consists of a pine cross, two or three fresh pine boughs stuck next to it, and pineneedles strewn in front. Candles and incense are burnt and the elder who prays asks that the child will remain healthy, keep it's c'ulel , and lead a prosperous life. Then a small piece of beeswax ( cabek ) is stuck on the middle of the top of the baby's head so that pukuh (evil spirit beings) won't molest the child. This beeswax remains on the head until it falls off naturally, which may be up to a year or so. An additional safeguard, practiced by some families, is to tie some blue thread ( yasal na ) around the baby's neck when it is a few weeks old. This helps it to avoid illness.\",\n",

A demon lived in that spring and this demon had taken the boy's soul so that he was sick. I knew this because I looked at the coca. Then I made an offering near the spring at night. In return for the offering the demon returned the boy's soul and now he is all right. It is like paying the evil one for the child's soul.\",\n",
       "  \"The concept of tener su compañía runs throughout all activity, at all ages. Having company means protection from the supernatural on a long trip, help around the house, harmonious social relations with age mates and kinsmen, and insurance against loneliness. Older women who are left alone in a house for several days will “borrow” a younger girl, a son's daughter for example, to keep them company, and a young wife going to market or to get firewood is usually expected to find company to do so. If not, she can well meet a strange man on the road, and get sick from verguenza (sickness assumed to originate from shame at being placed in an anomalous or embarrassing social situation) or espanto (fear and soul loss).\",\n",
       "  'The remaining festivals of the Santal year do not make the same stir throughout the countryside. Mokor is the name used in the area by Santals and non-Santals alike for the festival which takes place in mid-January. In some places it is called the Sakrat . At this time offerings are made to the ancestors in each house, and the celebration is accompanied by a display of stick dancing, which has replaced the former “sword and shield” dance. At the end of the following month the Mag Sim, the hen at the end of the month of Mag, is offered. In former times the village officials used to resign at this time and could be either replaced or reappointed, but the only relic of the old practice that has survived is that the headman has to treat the whole village to beer. Contracts with servants are renewed during the festival, and they receive the cloth that is always a part of the contract. In connection with rice cultivation there is the Erok’ Sim, the hen that is offered at the time of sowing, and Nãwãi, when the first fruits of the first rice crop are offered in the sacred grove. Before this takes place the new rice must not be eaten. The village priest cuts the first handful of the crop and offers some at the foot of each of the chief trees. A sprig is also tied round the trunk of the trees and remains there. While the prayer is being said, milk is poured on the offering. After the priest has done his part, similar offerings are made in every house to the house spirits and the ancestors, the rice being taken from the crops belonging to the family. In varying degrees the Santals share in some of the festivals and practices of the low-caste cultivators around them. In the early monsoon days, during the period of Rohini, which is an auspicious time for sowing rice, they make a mark round their houses with cowdung as a protection against snakes. The snake goddess festival occurs in late August, and although its observance is not widespread among the Santals there are some local celebrations, especially when there is an ojha in the village. The ojhas all keep this festival, and others go to them at this time to ask for medicines against snakebite. Some Hindu festivals, as we have seen, furnish the occasion for large gatherings of Santals. At Sarenga, in addition to the Lakshmi Puja, a somewhat smaller gathering takes place during the hot weather in connection with the celebration of the Siva Gajon at a local temple. At this time the Charak, or hook-swinging festival, otherwise known as the Pata, takes place. The practice has almost died out within the last fifteen years. It had been prohibited by the government, but as long as the old generation, which was accustomed to the practice, remained it continued with gradually diminishing fervour. The Santals gather now to sing and to dance. They also join the throngs of pilgrims, sightseers and traders who collect at the Bogri mela, or fair, some thirty miles from Sarenga. This fair, which is one of the most famous in Western Bengal, takes place at the time of the Dol Jatra near a temple dedicated to Krishna. The last day of the mela is chiefly renowned for the fact that on that day there is a great concourse of Santals for dancing.',\n",
       "  'When the Santal ojha is called in about a case of sickness or of sudden death, his first function is to try to determine the type to which the particular misfortune belongs. He consults the oracles in order to discover whether natural causes are to blame, in which case it is called plain rua, or sickness, or whether it is necessary to lay the responsibility on a witch, a bonga or a displeased ancestor. He sits down in the courtyard and waits until two sarjom leaves and some mustard oil in a leaf cup are brought to him. Holding one of the leaves in his left hand, he dips his right index finger in the oil and sprinkles some drops on the ground as an offering to the spirits. While doing so he asks for guidance in determining the correct cause of the illness or fatality. He then puts a drop of oil into each of the compartments of the leaf that he is holding, one drop representing one possible agency of evil. There is one for natural causes, three or four for different bongas, and other drops represent households in which there may be a witch, including the sick man’s house, his father-in-law’s house, the houses on the other side of the village street, and so on. When the drops are in position the ojha rubs the two leaves together and then holds the first leaf up to the light to discern the shapes that have been taken by the oil. He pronounces the cause of the disease in accordance with the pattern that he sees. If he decides that the bongas are displeased, he performs the ceremony known as bul mayam in much the same manner as the village co-priest does during the festivals. The blood which he draws from his arm, chest or thigh is mixed with some sundried rice until the whole is saturated. The ojha then proceeds to scatter the rice on the ground and prays to the spirits to spare the sick man from further interference. He confirms his diagnosis by oracle by examining the patient and in particular by feeling his pulse, and apart from his power with the spirits he has a stock-in-trade that includes many remedies, spells, and also powers of exorcism. This is resorted to at once in certain cases such as snake bite. The ojha squats down beside the sick person and takes in his left hand a peacock feather or sometimes one or two twigs from an old broom, and these he passes along the patient’s body without touching it, moving from the head to the feet and chanting the correct spells as he does so.',\n",

The symptoms are headaches and swelling of parts of the body; sisongo affects the legs of the patient, siyaya and tundundu affect the chest or stomach. Divination shows the cause, and exorcism and skilled treatment by an ng'aka are required. These mahamba would appear to be true ancestral spirits for, according to informants, siyaya is known to have existed among the Lozi of Lewanika's reign in the early years of the century. Its acceptance by the luyana was such that Kuntz (1932.131) considered that it was a Lozi ailment. In Mankoya, on the other hand, Symon (1950, 72-73, 76-77) noted that liyaya appeared only to affect the immigrant Wiko ( lunda-luvale ) peoples of the district. He records that the exorcism is assisted, in cases of sisongo and liyaya , by medicine taken orally and by hot fomentations applied to the affected parts of the body. He does not, as does Kuntz, mention inhalations. Modern mahamba , such as, ‘ ndeke (aeroplane), which is derived by infection from areas where planes are frequently seen. This lihamba is said to cause weakness of the legs when walking (McCulloch, 1951.78), were also encountered during the investigation, and one of these, bindele , is fully discussed in Chapter VI.\",\n",

I shall shoot it; it will make a good roast!” And he shot an arrow. But it did not hit. As he was about to shoot the second arrow, K't tu assumed a human shape before his eyes.

The story goes this way: Guo Ching has a son who lives in Taitung and who is already married. I have heard that this boy had struck up with a girl in Taitung who already had a husband, so her husband divorced her. Although the girl's husband had already divorced her, her husband's mother became very angry, and as a result fell sick and died. Before this old mother died, she was particularly angry with Guo Ching's boy because the latter had damaged their family. For this reason she used some superstitious method (the kind of [Taiwanese aboriginal] wizardry you photographed when you were in Taitung) to wound Guo Ching's son's wife. The objective was to cause his wife to become sick and die so that Guo Ching's son wouldn't have a wife. Not long afterward Guo Ching's son's wife took sick (a neurosis like the one Guo Tong-ming died of). Guo Ching's boy saw that his wife had already developed a neurosis and was terrified, so two weeks ago he sent his wife back to our village. After this woman got to our village, she upset the family every day, and struck people. So Guo Ching's family had three gods come down. Two [ tâng-ki ] were from our village: Guo Tian-huah [Third Prince] and Guo Ching-shoei [the Great Saint], and one tâng-ki from another village. I hear that these three gods used very peaceful means in taking care of this matter to implore the ghost who was bothering the woman's body to leave. Finally the three gods used impolite words and told the ghost who was bothering the woman's body that if she didn't leave, the three of them would be impolite to her. At length the ghost left, and the three gods [left and their tâng-ki ] sat down to rest. After the three tâng-ki had stopped, they had some refreshments, and when they had finished their refreshments the three left together to go home. But...they had only just arrived at the pond behind Guo Ching's house (for it was the road beside the village pond) when the ghost, who had been standing there waiting for them, struck the Third Prince's tâng-ki, Guo Tian-huah. Tian-huah was knocked to the ground by her, but just as the ghost was about to strike the other two tâng-ki their two gods possessed them, so they began to fight vigorously with the ghost. The two tâng-ki fought very boisterously [ Rehnaw ], sometimes chasing into the trees, sometimes onto a roof, sometimes chasing her through the fishpond. Finally that invisible ghost lost the fight and ran away.\",\n",

       "  'Social contrasts, however, separated the south people from their northern neighbors more effectively than did the natural conditions mentioned. There was always a certain tension and lurking irritability between the two. Though, to be sure, outward sociableness prevailed at times, serious hostility not infrequently broke out. This opposition arose rather unconsciously from economic causes. The north people subsisted primarily on the meat of the cururos and used the soft skins of these animals for cloaks. This prompted the south people to make fun of their northern neighbors and look down on them as “cururo eaters.” A transitory penetration of individual south-people into the north country never occurred for hunting purposes, much less, as Tonelli:9 believes, for the stealing of women, though a medicine man from the other region was not infrequently held responsible for sicknesses or cases of accidents and death. There is no reliable clue for guessing at the frequency of such disputes or hostilities. For all this was hidden from the eyes of the but recently arrived whites, and thereafter earlier conditions changed. Nevertheless, the missionaries felt this ancient hostility. They established their first settlements in the territory of the north people, who continued to prevent their southern neighbors from visiting the mission; as Beauvoir (BS: XX, 37; 1896) complains, “non si presentarona più in corpo di tribù intera, perchè quelli del Nord imposero loro con minaccie la partenza, e passato il Rio Grande, pare si siano scambiate alcune frecciate, lasciandovi alcuni anche la vita” /they no longer appeared in a body of the entire tribe, because those of the North forced departure on them with threats, and, having crossed the Rio Grande, it seems some arrows were exchanged, some persons even losing their lives/.',\n",

Water for washing the baby is heated in a pot by the fire until mildly warm. The mother then washes the baby from stem to stern with her hand rather than with a rag. In place of soap she uses c'opak root for the first year or so. Even the clothing of the infant cannot be washed in the river, although soap may be used for it, because the river would carry away the dirt and defecation from the clothes, bringing it far from the home of the child. If this were to happen the baby's c'ulel would be disaffected bringing illness upon the baby.

The souls of the inmates of the house hover near the center post when they are not in the body. The soul calling ceremony is held near this center post.

They are now used to expel spirits, though one wise woman says this is not the right meaning. “The cause of taiti ,” says Poasa, “is the souls of the dead or the ancestor spirits.” If a spirit hits a man so that he does not know his soul, he is taiti . Sometimes before he is in sight, the patient declares the leech is coming, and refuses to have him, saying “the place smells bad,” referring to the medicine; he struggles. When the leech arrives, the patient tries to escape. As he is held down, he calls out the names of great grandparents, or forefathers, or Tutumatua, or the Wind Women.

In fact, of course, life in a rural community in an underdeveloped country is fraught with danger, with grief because of high infant mortality (unless one cares to believe another myth that African mothers do not grieve over the death of their children as much as European mothers) and with worries over the possibility of crop failures. There are also many fears resulting from traditional beliefs, such as the very great possibility, if one is successful in some venture, of being bewitched by others who are motivated by jealousy; or the fear of the coincidental, such events being thought to have been planned in some way. Large numbers of people in the rural as well as urban areas complain of persistent, diffuse symptoms which in Europe would be regarded as of neurotic origin. In an area where the prevalence of some form of parasitic infestation and anaemia is so high it is, of course, easy to treat such patients for something physical; having failed to experience a cure, the patient is unlikely to return to the out-patient clinic, but will continue with his round of private doctors if he has enough money to pay for the coveted injection. Neurotic conditions are hardly likely to be diagnosed by a doctor who has to see a hundred patients in a morning, as they file past in a line, many receiving aspirins and a purge, particularly when the doctor may have had no training whatsoever in psychiatry. Many symptoms are much more worrying to the patient than the doctor often realises, and attempts should be made to reassure patients about them. There is the fear that dizziness may lead to epilepsy, that a mild skin disease may turn into leprosy, that a persistent cough is tuberculosis or that a persistent headache is spoiling the brain.

Rituals of affliction are performed on a non-automatic basis and are prompted by the diagnosis of a spiritually caused illness. During such rituals the formerly ill administer to the currently ill, and so it is that religious status in the bori cult is achieved through affliction. Thus, as Turner observes, affliction has a double meaning: it is both a punishment for some kind of neglect or transgression-for bori spirits do not possess a victim without provocation-and it is evidence of a spirit’s selection of his victim as a cult member (1967: 10). But initiation also marks the transition from one social status to another, from outsider to insider, at least as far as cult membership is concerned. Most social transitions fall under the heading of life-crisis rituals (birth/naming, marriage, death) and are concerned with ascribed statuses, but the bori initiation is a ritual applied to an achieved status.',\n",

After a short while he takes them up again, salutes and removes the covering leaf; after having scrutinized the leaf, he announces the result. It is unnecessary to say that the ojha arranges the result, and that he does it according to what he understands is the common opinion of those who have engaged him.

At the apacheta on leaving a town, the parents cry “[child's name] hutani hutakim haniu qeparatati!” (“Come! Come now! You must not stay”) so that the child's soul will not linger behind. Sometimes when a child is sick they believe that its soul has been “caught” ( katatau ) by the spirit ( kata ) of the road, a church, a certain field, river, lake, or mountain. If it is “caught” by the earth ( oraqen katatau ), there has to be a trukaqaña to “change the health.” This is an offering of colored wools, candy, coca leaves, etc., which is left at the spot by a yatiri or laliri doctor, and a traveller should avoid this offering if he sees it at a crossroad lest he be endangered thereby. Sometimes a child has a multa (“fright”) and falls at a certain spot; then they ask it “where did you fall?” and take some earth from that spot and give it to the child to eat so that it will not become sick. Another remedy is the milucana ritual. In this a piece of milu or alum is placed on the sick child's chest, left there two or three hours, and then rubbed all over its body. After this the alum is put in a large bowl or lamota of putrified urine, covered up with a cloth, and taken out at the end of twenty to thirty minutes. The alum swells up into a sponge-like mass which the yatiri studies for a diagnosis. Then he says: “The child was frightened at this spring,” or “It will get well,” or “It will die.” When the augury is bad the yatiri takes a knife and cuts the mass with exorcisms, makes a hole in the ground and buries the milu .\",\n",

In 1889, the Blackfoot population stood at 815; in 1896, it reached 1,226; but since the death rate was nearly double the birth rate, the future did not look auspicious.

Although the Blackfoot were vaccinated against smallpox in 1910, no one had the means to cure tuberculosis. For the family of Chief Crowfoot, this disease proved to be especially tragic. In 1886, agent Magnus Beggs observed casually that “the health of the Indians during the year [had] been generally good, Crowfoot being the principal sufferer in his own family, having lost all of his younger children, and being constantly in mourning.” In the year following his release from the penitentiary, tuberculosis was probably what claimed Poundmaker, Crowfoot‘s beloved adopted son. 17 17.

       "  'Dr. Koch-Grünberg, in his travels through the Vaupés region, collected some 50 different mask representations. My own observations along the Cuduiarí covered 30. Altogether, there is now a combined list of 62. 4 See the end of this chapter. Since the masks are intended to portray all the living creatures of the Cubeo world the number of masks is potentially vast. No one ceremony uses them all. There are, however, key characters that are most commonly represented. These are Jaguar, Dung beetle, Carrion vulture, Butterfly, Aracú fishes, Eagle, Sloth, Parrot, Dragonfly, Minnows (who are not masked but are an important element in the ceremonial dramatization), Pyénkü (a small black fish), Frogs, and a variety of cannibalistic ogres or forest demons, the Abúhuwa . Informants would not say which of the masked representations was most important, presumably because invidiousness is, to the Cubeo, in poor taste. Judging, however, by their prominence, I would say that Jaguar, Butterfly, Abúhuwa, Dung beetles, Carrion vulture, and Aracú fishes were most important, more or less in that order. Except for the aracú, the esteemed fish of the region, these creatures all have an association with death. The jaguar is, of course, the dreaded sorcerer. The sorcerer is called yaví (jaguar) and the Cubeo regard any jaguar as likely to be either a sorcerer or a sorcerer’s dog. The morpho butterfly with its beautiful blue wings is a creature of sorcerers and of evil. The information Koch-Grünberg received was that the morpho butterfly ( tatárako ) lives at Yuruparí cachoeira on the Vaupés, where he brews malaria in a calabash and strews it over the land (1909, II, 181). I did not hear this account, but I was told that when a sorcerer is cooking a brew that will kill a victim at a distance the morpho butterfly appears and encircles the pot. Finally, it falls in and is consumed and at that moment the victim dies.',\n",

They agreed that warm water was customarily used, although unheated water could be substituted at midday. Each baby in the household used to be bathed in his own special vessel, which in the old days was made of pottery, but which more recently has been of European metalware. There was no soap in the old days, but with the influx of Europeans, soap came into common use, and each child had his own piece. As the child grew older, it was customary to give him only two baths a day—at midday and at bedtime. The same type of herbal infusion that was used for newborn babies was customarily used from time to time throughout the early months, especially during the first two months. Other herb baths were considered to be specific treatments for illnesses of various kinds and were used especially for fever.',\n",

It is to be found in the fact that pig-arrows are used in fighting, so that the tree comes to have a special relation to the shedding of blood. Plumes of shredded Tetranthera wood (made from an old arrow-shaft) must be worn by a homicide during the period of “purification” as a protection against the dangers that are believed to threaten him because he has shed blood. The same plumes were formerly always carried in a dance preceding a fight, and at such times the natives used to rub their bows with the shredded wood in order to ensure success in battle. Thus it is clear that there is a special connection between this tree and the shedding of blood, due to the fact that pig-arrows, of which the shafts are made from it, are used in fighting as well as for killing pigs and other animals.

Every person has a unique identity, based on the year, month, day and hour of his birth. In the traditional system of calendrical calculation, each year of the sixty year cycle is ruled over by a different ‘Lord of the Year’ ( Tai-Sui ). An individual born in a certain year may ‘clash’ with ( Ch'ung ) the Lord of that year, and thus make it necessary to ‘hide his fate’ ( kham un ), to avoid any unpleasant fate which might be in store for him. In this particular case, a man's fate had been ‘hidden’ earlier in the year, but it was felt that some mistake had been made and that the measure had been ineffective. So the gods were being asked to ‘hide’ it again this evening. The ‘fate’ was in a small ceramic jar, represented by a few grains of rice and beans, a few small nails, a coin or two, and a piece of red paper with the year, month, day and hour of birth of the individual written on it. The jar was covered with a piece of red cloth over the mouth, tied down with 12 strands of black thread. Pasted across the top was a ‘seal charm’ ( hong-hu-a ) made of a strip of yellow paper with a ‘charm’ written on it. A bamboo incense holder was tied to the side of the jar. In this case, the fate was thought to have escaped from the jar, thus allowing the Lord of the Year to see it and to make trouble for the involved. As a result, the man had become ill. The god directed that the seal and the red cloth should be removed and the jar placed on the sand planchette. The god used the peach branch to write a lengthy charm over the open mouth of the jar. He directed that the red cloth be re-tied, and while this was being done, the god called for the ‘red pen’ ( Hung-Tsu-Pi ) helper immediately took a writing brush which had been dipped in red ink and attached it to the end of the stylus. The god called for strips of yellow paper about an inch wide and six inches long, to be placed on the sand tray. He then wrote out three charms on the yellow paper with the ‘red pen’. These charms he had pasted over the top of the cloth covered jar to ‘seal’ ( Feng ) it. The peach branch (now bereft of the ‘red pen’) was used to trace another ‘charm’ in the air over the jar.

In my analysis of the rites, I have placed great emphasis on the significance of beeswax, an emphasis that reflects the importance that the Barasana attach to this substance themselves. Again, whilst I know that the ritual use of beeswax is common to all the Indian groups of the Pirá-paraná area, I cannot find any direct evidence for its use in Yurupary rites elsewhere. The Barasana burn beeswax on a number of occasions outside the context of Yurupary rites (see ch. 7) and it is significant that many other authors mention the use of ‘smoke from burning embers’, ‘resin and embers’, ‘burning resin’, ‘fumigation’, etc., in exactly these same contexts. Considering that the beeswax in question (cerumen) is made largely from resin, these references suggest that its ritual use may be more widespread than might at first be supposed. Whether or not beeswax is, or was, also used in the context of Yurupary rites I cannot say, but there is evidence from myth for the existence of something like the beeswax gourd amongst the Tukano (see ch. 7, nn. 22 and 30). Finally, it must be pointed out that the ritual use of beeswax is easily overlooked, especially during Fruit House rites, partly because it is less eye-catching than Yurupary instruments and ritual whipping, and partly because it looks and smells very like the resin that is used to light the house.',\n",

       "  'While the blessing of a wadaad is respected and his curse feared, the occasions when wadaads are believed to resort to sorcery except in legitimately protecting their property are rare. Yet there is a spirit-possession disease known as wadaaddo (plural of wadaad ) particularly prevalent in the north-east of Somaliland. The disease is sometimes diagnosed in people suffering from tuberculosis or pneumonia and the general symptoms are coughing, sneezing, and vomiting with occasional lapses into unconsciousness. This ailment is treated by wadaads, particularly those who have previously suffered from it, who adjure the spirit to quit the patient by reading potent verses of the Quran and bathing him with perfume. Perfume in Somaliland has a ritual significance and is associated with religious celebrations. Frequently on Fridays when men are holding a religious ceremony perfume is poured liberally over the hands of those taking part.  These wadaads of the spirit world were, it is believed, formerly the familiars of Boqor ‘Ismaan, Sultan of the Majeerteen ‘Ismaan Mahamuud; and when he died are said to have been released to trouble people. The disease appears to have spread westwards only within the last fifteen years or so and is not very common. That these spirits should attack people is attributed to the belief that at the death of Boqor ‘Ismaan his descendants refused to care for his attendant spirits and sent them away.',\n",
       "  \"(1) There are evil spirits who are the souls of dead baere (plural of bari; see below) or never were anthropomorphic; they normally dwell in the sky, but are able to visit the earth, where they are known as bope, maeréboe, or waikuru. They cause falling stars and illness, can predict future events, but above all claim the prerogative as to various kinds of food, which unauthorized mortals consume under pain of sickness and death. The bope possesses a bari and eats the dishes in question with the bari's mouth. These spirits also appear in dreams and reveal the future, but they take no interest in the social life of the Indians and do not in any significant way figure in any myth. A bari becomes such through visitations of a bope. He must scrupulously observe the rules laid down to him on pain of loss of power and catching an incurable disease. However, the bope may render him invulnerable and give him the power to hunt game in the guise of a jaguar. The bari may inflict disease and death, but also cures and confers other benefits on the tribe. A client will offer him a cigar, whereupon the shaman calls on the bope, a number of whom led by a spokesman then possess him. In doctoring, the bari smokes the cigar, then the spokesman of the spirits asks why they have been called. One present explains, then the doctor sucks the afflicted parts, expectorating the putative cause, e. g., a beetle, which he scans, announcing his prognosis. Certain feminine diseases, however, he must not attempt treating lest he impair his supernatural powers. Most important of the bari's functions is the “consecration” of the food reserved to the bope--a procedure that ensures to himself the choicest morsels. (2) Radically distinct is the cult of the dead (aroe). Every aroe is tangibly represented in two ways: by its impersonator at the funeral ceremony, and by a flageolet with a gourd bearing the distinctive clan designs and preserved by the dead person's clansmen in memory of him. The aroe come to the village to eat, drink, or dance; foretell the future; cause illness; and otherwise intimately affect the daily life of the Indians. The aroe commune with the Indians through a medium, the aroettawarari, whom they possess or enlighten in dreams and who may summon them by a special ceremony.\",\n",

I was also supposed to bring along many medicines and strings of beads, indeed, stay with them forever if possible, for at the present time first this one and then that one of their children would become ill, and since these maladies stem from the whites, only a white could remedy them. From the third day of my being here, when I had scarcely dispensed the first medicines, I was generally called nkol t = European medicine-man; from then on I retained this name among the northern group for the following 83 cont. years. To be sure, casual wishes and promises on the lips of an Indian do not mean much, but their statements sufficed for me to be able to conclude favorably that I had adopted the right tone in my intercourse with them and that, in this way, we would later probably come closer to each other. This hope encouraged me; for now, in parting, I was under the grievous impression that the thought of the sad fate of this handful of survivors of the once numerous Selk'nam people aroused in me! With anxious care I tore myself away from this camp, as though I were never again to see many of its dear occupants; there vigorously throbbed in me the wish to sit once more in their midst, in order to understand them better and become more closely acquainted with them! When P. Zenone gave me his hand in farewell, he did not hold back his impressions and told me openly: “So many travelers have already passed by here and gaped at our Indians; but none has come as frankly close to them 84 as you. Even some taciturn old men have liked your visit and confided to me that they want to see you again next year. You will be welcome to all of us and then the outcome of your work will be successful!” ... It may have been more of a natural disposition that introduced me so favorably to these human beings who are so difficult to approach.

The informant expresses here a certain doubt about the jaguar that does occasionally seem to be able to cause diseases. only the contact with the “crystals” scattered by lightning can cause evil. It is said that all diseases were created by the Sun Father to control human conduct through them, especially, as we have seen, sexual conduct, but the execution of punishment for not obeying moral norms is not the task of the Sun but of his instruments, principally Vihó-mahsë . All illnesses except those caused by Vaí-mahsë are produced by Vihó-mahsë who serves as an instrument. His field of action being the Milky Way, he is thus associated with the harpies and buzzards, consumers of all that is rotten and represents the essence of all that is sick and pathogenic.

The penalties for disregarding these injunctions are usually some kind of illness. Sore mouth, sore eyes, blindness, boils, etc., are generally regarded as resulting from such, and for anyone to be so afflicted is of itself evidence of such violations. Curiously enough, the violation, if such it be, cannot always be laid to the victim himself, since by social usage he may be forced to keep his seat while another is doing the very thing his medicine prohibits. For example, if metal must not be struck in the presence of a certain paintedtipi owner, it is not likely that he himself will violate the injunction, but he may be unable to prevent others from doing the striking.

Great numbers of people of all ages and both sexes assemble, and as the men of the community go to join this crowd they each grasp a weapon and on arrival at the scene brandish it fiercely.

Stephen Hugh-Jones has shown, for instance, that when initiates are ritually opened up they are prone to a type of illness in which the body literally drains away through the excessively open anus (1979: 198ff). There are other ways in which illness is a repetition of events which precede it: some foods can introduce items of material equipment used in their production into the body and these implements attack the internal organs. Thus, if boiled maniocstarch drink is drunk on the wrong occasion (when the individual is ‘too open’), the stick that was used to stir it will stir up the s of the drinker. Again, there is a significant category of foods described as ‘grease-filling’. These are fatty foods, but more important seems to be the fact that they exude grease while cooking. When the individual eats these foods he or she is ‘filled with grease’ and then jaguars and snakes magically see the grease and perceive the eater as ‘edible game’ Thus, the food exudes grease while cooking and then the consumer exudes grease after eating.

If the Western medicines fail to help and the patient does not seem to recover quickly enough, or if the illness is very unusual, the villagers conclude that the disorder is caused by some supernatural agent and must be dealt with by magical means.

The term pansa utai (something passed by) refers to a spirit encounter of which the Iban concerned may not even be consciously aware (Jensen 1974:147). Nevertheless, they might have been ‘struck by a spirit sword’ or ‘wounded by an arrow from the spirits blowpipe’ (Nyuak 1906:168). Or the spirit might have deposited a physical token -- a piece of bone, wood, cloth, hair -- in the person's body (Jensen 1974:147). Using the quartz crystal ‘seeing stone’ ( batu ilau ) and stroking the patient's body with objects from the medicine box, a manang is thought to locate and then remove any troublesome foreign matter. Jensen reports that the manang first bites the blade of a knife for strength (1974:147). In a case Brooke Low describes, the manang called on a spirit familiar to divine the fate of the patient and reveal the location of the intrusive object (Ling Roth 1896:I,267-268). If a spirit itself is causing the problem, the manang may propitiate it with sacrifices, entice it into a wooden figure, try to will it away, bark and growl at it or otherwise frighten it away, and in some cases even attempt to kill it (Brooke Low in Ling Roth 1896:I,266; Jensen 1974:148; Richards 1981:262-263). Just as these forms of attack are directed against spirits who interfere with the physical person ( tuboh ), so they are used to overcome spirits who ensnare a wandering soul ( semengat ). In the latter case, the confrontation occurs among the spirits, as part of the manang 's efforts to retrieve the soul. Thus, ‘occasionally on emerging from his “trance” a shaman will relate his adventures, telling in graphic language of the menacing demons he encountered and how he snatched the lost soul from their grasp, just as they were preparing to devour it’ (Freeman 1967:316).\",\n",

In contrast to their own exuberance, men even regard the pain which a bride experiences on her first nights of intercourse through the opening and enlargement of the infibulated vulva as a further expression of male virility and female submission. 1 . Men sometimes boas! that their virility is such that they can, unaided, force an opening in the infibulated vulva. Generally, however, the bride’s mother, or if the marriage is celebrated at the husband’s home, his mother, opens the vulva with a small knife. This is said to be something that amother readily does for her daughter as the wishes to make everything ‘smooth’ for the couple. Sometimes, however, the incision is made by a woman of the despised occupational group who, amongst other things, specialise in infibulation. There is no doubt that in the early weeks of a first marriage most women experience much pain. In addition, the forced removal of a bride to her marriage hut by her husband’s friends, which is reported to take place in some weddings, although I have not witnessed it, can be seen to emphasise the dominant role of the man and the subservient, even captive, status of the woman. 2 . Cerulli who reports this amongst the Majeerteen argues from it to a former state of marriage by capture (Cerulli, 1919, p. 73). But as far as I know, there is no sound evidence to suggest that marriage by capture was ever a general process in northern Somaliland.',\n",

Testifying to the efficacy of the Aymara slings and clubs as skull-crackers is the interesting fact that two per cent of the crania in the Muñiz collection, 213 Muñiz and McGee, 1897, pp. 14, 64. representing “vigorous and healthy young men, presumptively soldierly,” had been trephined. This is a broad hint that in Aymara medicine one of the major functions of trephining may have been to relieve compression fractures of the skull caused by these weapons. In defence against them the natives had a light shield, called “kherari” according to von Tschudi, which protected most of the body. The sometime function of women in warfare as a kind of supply train, bringing up heavy stones in their skirts held like aprons, may account for the persistent legend found in the early writers that there were “Amazons” among the Aymara.',\n",

(Here is a concept that the knowledge of the names and formulae of black magic is a trust, justifiable if used for one's own ends, but not to be used for general bewitching by any casual person--hence the reference to persons ‘of good will’, that is, with a genuine grievance to redress.) I was also told by Kavakiua of Taumako in 1928 that the Ariki Taumako invoked Tuna for black magic in connection with his sacred adzes, under the titles of Matanefu (Eyes Befogged) and Fakaseketaki. These titles were not confirmed by other people, though one similar to the second was said to be used by the Tavi elder in his Somosomo rites. (p. 173).\",\n",

A description of them, with a list of titles under which they were invoked (not necessarily complete) was given to me by Pa Porima, in great secrecy and fear, and many other men also gave me information about them, either in interview or in working contexts. On three points all were agreed: that these female deities were invoked very generally--‘they are in all lineages’; that they were essentially a pair, with balanced titles; and that their powers were great, tending towards illness and destruction. As a mythic corollary, they were usually identified as the sisters of the Atua i te Uruao, and one of them (opinion varied as to which) was the wife of Pu Taufiti, usually said to be Rata (cf. op. cit ., p. 90). According to Pae Sao in 1929 the two deities lived in a cave known as Te Rua sa Akitunu on Reani. They were sisters of the Atua i te Uruao, generated like him from two sticks which rubbed together produced fire (the fire-plough). When a man climbed Reani the leaves of plants striking his body as he pushed his way through them snatched away his spirit ( mauri ) which goddesses put in their basket.

Only the most skilled medicine-man could make fetiches; herbs had to be carefully selected, and other materials were needed, such as the hearts of lions, leopards, crocodiles, elephants, buffaloes, and other animals, which (it was supposed) would make the owner brave and strong. These materials were pounded together and stuffed into the horns, or they were mixed with clay, made into fetiches, and dedicated by the medicine-man to different gods. They thus became identified with a supernatural being, and in consequence they were possessed by the gods, and were powerful and effective. The secret of making these fetiches was confined to a small number of medicine-men who never divulged it to others, unless they themselves were to reap some benefit by the communication.

Hence some spent a sleepless night by the fire, while others suffered terribly from diarrhoea. When fighting resumed on the morrow, Kiggala’s sons defeated Lutimba and he fled.

Moreover, no man may sleep face downwards there 1 [in the sheds of the sacred canoes -- Analyst] a position which is quite allowable in a house.

       "  \"Another example of spirit medium behaviour in the domestic field was the consultation of the medium Pa Nukufuti by a member of the chiefly lineage of Taumako, Pa Nukutapu. He was concerned about the health of his wife and children, which he related to his possession of a ritual adze powered by a god of malignant temper whose representation was the reef eel. 3 See Tikopia Ritual and Belief , 1967, pp. 222-5. The woman had had dreams in which she was threatened by the eel, and Pa Nukutapu was anxious to know what the reason was, and if he was responsible. He came to the medium's dwelling one afternoon, having been summoned there by a ‘spirit’ message. I had previously been having a long seance with the medium, who in trance state awaited his visitor. When Pa Nukutapu unexpectedly saw me there he greeted me with surprise, then put on a comic act. He sat up very straight, locked his hands, rattled on the mat, assumed a fierce expression, then relaxed and said, laughing: ‘The Atua i Kafika has come!’ This imitation was treated as a mild joke by those present, including the medium in his trance state, but we then turned to serious things. After some general conversation the medium as spirit leaned forward and said to his visitor: ‘I summoned you, brother, to tell you something’. Then he referred to the adze and accused Pa Nukutapu of having used it improperly, by calling on the god without referring the matter to the control of his chief. Pa Nukutapu listened very seriously but denied that he had acted without due care. He said: ‘Oh! I have not called upon the name of the Atua’. But the medium repeated several times: ‘I am only just telling you; I have sympathy for you; I am saying this to you, brother, because you asked me....’ With the repeated denials of Pa Nukutapu the theme changed and concentrated on the assertion that the children had interfered with the adze. Pa Nukutapu said: ‘I tell the children not to go near the place where I sit, but they won't listen’. Further admonition by the medium in trance state followed, with Pa Nukutapu listening very respectfully. The talk was laconic and allusive to earlier discussion between them, and I did not understand it all, as I listened without interruption; but the medium was clearly searching for a way to identify an explanation which Pa Nukutapu would accept as fitting the facts as he knew them. Then Pa Nukutapu said apologetically, referring to his failure to bring a food gift because of the famine, ‘there's nothing to make it with--you know’. But he extracted from his belt in a fumbling way a short stick of tobacco, which the medium accepted with good grace as recompense for the consultation. It seemed to me that the diagnosis had been rather inconclusive, and had been precautionary rather than explanatory, but it seemed to have given satisfaction. It illustrated an important role of the spirit medium--to act as a recipient of confidences and complaints, to suggest alternative explanations, and to give some advice about conduct and reassurance about the future. This role came to a peak in cases of actual illness.\",\n",
       "  'The common traits of the three types of therapeutic form would seem to be that they all make use of secrecy and obscurity and have connections with the “abnormal” and unknown. Such similarities may be one of the reasons why “traditional” healers show willingness to acquire Western medical knowledge (Tresalti 1984). In some parts of Africa this has proceeded to an extent which now makes it possible to speak of a “professionalisation of African medicine” (Bernardi 1984; Last & Chavunduka 1986). To some extent this is also related to the ways in which experts build up their status. Their function as mediators between the known and the unknown, the safe and the uncertain, implies that healers of any kind gain a particular prestige. As Duerr puts it: “knowledge awaits the one who returns from the wilderness” (1985:74). Exploiting this knowledge - for good or for bad (Jackson 1987c) - is what therapy is about.',\n",

A common definition of fetiches and amulets, given by the people, was that the amulet was made of wood, and the fetich was composite. This may be taken to be true as a general rule, though there were exceptions to it. The amulets were made from several kinds of wood and from roots, and sometimes from herbs known to the medicine-men for their healing properties.',\n",

The basic idea has been suggested to be possibly due to the “Elementargedanken” of Bastian.',\n",

They were carried or worn on the person to be ready for use; some of them were in fact turned into ornaments, and carried about long after they had ceased to be required for their original purpose. The medicine-men were the vendors of amulets; the majority were composed either of wood or of herbs, made into compact shapes by the medicine-men, so that they could be carried about on the person. Some of them were for outward application only; others were to be taken internally; they were rubbed on a stone or scraped with a knife, and the powder thus obtained was mixed with water or beer, if for internal use, and with butter, if for FIG. 51.—AMULETS. outward application. They had a wide range as remedies; indeed, almost every ailment known to the medicine-men was treated with some kind of amulet. The expectant mother had her amulet, and the person suffering from inflammation of the eyes had his. These amulets were valued so highly by the people that, when the disease was healed, the medicine was not cast aside, but decorated and worn as an ornament, and was thus ready, should there be any return of the old symptoms. As charms they were used chiefly for the prevention of disease; their medicinal properties had brought them into notoriety, and they were afterwards regarded as possessing powers to avert the evil which they had originally been meant to cure. One amulet partook of the nature of a fetich, it was called Luzalo, and was designed to insure fecundity. It consisted of a piece of wood, often sewn into a small cat-skin bag, at times decorated with cowry-shells, and worn tied round the waist, so that the amulet rested in front of the wearer. Other amulets having the same purpose were small packets of powdered herbs, which were worn by the woman round her waist; some of the powder would be mixed with water, and drunk from time to time. These packets of herbs were not called nsiriba, like other amulets, but lukisa .',\n",

Victory Call always took along his bow and arrows should there be a surprise attack. The Skidi fields were located north-west of the villages. Going out early in the morning, one could see the boys picketing about on the high bluff to the west. That morning as they looked up at a big hill west of Genoa, they would also see someone stationed, scouting around for the enemy. The night before Mad Bear and another man had made up their minds to do this. Before dawn they climbed the high bluff west of Beaver Creek and sat down and looked toward where they were roasting corn. “Look at that smoke. Afterward, we can get some corn,” they said. Their legs were hanging over the bluff. There was a little creek that ran from the southwest into Beaver Creek running parallel with the edge of the bluff where the two men were sitting, and a Sioux had been hiding in a trough and watching them. The two men were talking about the cherries on the side of the bluff and the big yellow plums in the bottom and how they would eat them next day. As they were talking, they heard the Sioux making a noise like a crow. Later Mad Bear told his story. “I got frightened and I never thought of my bow and arrows. I was transfixed with fear when I saw all of them. But all at once I got over it. The other man didn’t get over it. We ran down the bluff to the creek. The other man left his bow and arrows there.” Mad Bear continued: “I don’t see why the other fellow left me and ran away to get under the brush. The Sioux caught him. As I ran down the bluff, I felt a shot through my back. It came out of my chest, but I got into the water anyway and they let me go. The other fellow had disappeared.” We looked in the water for him but couldn’t find him. Long after when someone came back to Nebraska, they thought they saw him and he had been scalped and was ashamed to come back. The Pawnees took Mad Bear over the creek and he was doctored by Heavy-Trophies and Herd-of-Horses. As Mad Bear described it, “The doctor put his mouth against mine and blew some water with some medicine in it into my mouth and made me swallow it. I had been sleepy all along, but this woke me up. Then they gave me some medicine to chew and water to drink and I felt better and never worried about it again. I sent the doctors home.” Finally the Pawnees came out and killed a big tall Sioux. His bones remained there a long time afterward. One Sioux was killed and one Pawnee killed or scalped.

Thus, whereas a wizard can, at best, inflict a lingering disease, which is easily cured by counter magic, there is \"little chance\" of combating the malevolent activities of a witch ( SLS :4,5-46). Witches-called mulukuauso (Malinowski 1955), or mulukwausi (Malinowski [1922] 1961) -- are \"actual living women who may be known and talked with in ordinary life \\'\" but who, in a disembodied form, \"are extremely virulent, powerful, and also ubiquitous. Anyone who chances to be exposed to them is sure to be attacked\" (Malinowski 1955:152-53). Dangerous on land, these \"terrible women\" are even more dangerous on sea, where they destroy shipwrecked sailors (Malinowski [1922] 1961:chapter 10). Although, on land, witches may sometimes cause such ailments as toothaches, swelling of the testicles, tumors, and genital discharge ( SLS :47), more typically they kill and eat their unfortunate victims. Pouncing on them from some hidden -- usually high --place, the invisible witch removes their insides, together with their eyes and tongue, before eating them ( SLS :45).

Modern psychiatry takes the view that human behavior is a mixture of biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors.

       "  \"In contrast to Lewis's cross-cultural study, Freeman's own work deals with Iban shamanism in its socio-cultural context. Unlike Sutlive's view of the physician who heals himself, Freeman describes the manang as a ‘healer of the spiritually afflicted’ and sees the practice of shamanism as oriented to the needs of the clients (1975:283). He notes the Iban belief that all humans have separable souls ( semengat ), which may wander abroad and become ensnared by a malevolent spirit. Should this happen ‘the owner will become ill and it is with the recovery of souls and the returning of them to their rightful owners that Iban shamans ( manang ) are principally concerned’ (Freeman 1979:235). In the article ‘Shaman and incubus’, Freeman briefly describes the diagnosis and ritual typically performed by a manang in order to discern the state and whereabouts of the missing soul and to effect its return (1967:316). He then recounts and analyses an instance of a quite different manang performance, in which the shaman slays an incubus spirit. This spirit ( antu buyu ) is thought to seduce Iban women and later to claim the soul of the women's offspring, resulting in miscarriage or the death of a child (1967:317-318). Freeman describes Manang Bungai, the shaman concerned in this instance, as ‘a strongly masculine figure’ in both bearing and personality (1967:320). From the time of his arrival in the longhouse to perform the ritual, he was ‘the imperturbable master of the scene’ (1967:325). Manang Bungai specialized in the slaying of incubi, a formidable task which few shaman were prepared to tackle (1967:319-320). This suggests that the manang role may be interpreted by individual shaman in terms of their own personality and disposition. So Nyala, an aggressively masculine longhouse-headman and renowned head-hunter, confided to Freeman that, if in a dream he were ordered to become a shaman, he would, like Bungai, specialize in the slaying of incubi. ‘But then’, observes Freeman, referring to head-hunting and shamanism, ‘the two pastimes have much in common’ (1967:340).\",\n",

The olemunaci is often a “piedra iman” or magnet to attract (metal) money; hence it is also called auxactir ala (from Sp. aguja , “needle,” “lift” and ala , “stone,” or “needle-lifting stone”). The Collawayus say that there are two kinds of magnet, male and female. The “female” magnet has a smooth surface, the “male” is spiny and rough. The medicine-men both sell and use them themselves. In the south of the altiplano around Sicasica a compound amulet or “bolsita” is placed around the neck of a child on a string. This may contain such articles as a small knife, rosary-beads, a small cross, a little salt, a small yellow chili, milu or alum, hawatikilu (a fruit pit), kiñulu (a root) a piece of añil or blue stone, etc.--to protect the child from sickness, falls, hurts, wounds, and “bad luck” in general. While the child who wears one of these is sleeping, no ariari or ancancu (vampires or disease-producing demons) dare approach.',\n",

       "  \"Covering fate is prescribed by Tio Sin-se* in years when a patient's eight characters indicate his being especially vulnerable. For children every year from birth to the age of seven is such a year. For older patients every year in which the earthly branch of the year in which they were born conflicts with the earthly branch representing the current year itself, arousing the god of the year's anger, is such a year. Because of the way in which these conflicts are computed, they occur every six years throughout the patient's life. In addition covering fate should be performed if the patient is twenty-nine and thus approaching the crucial half-way point in the sixty year cycle which began with his birth. All of these years are spoken of as narrow gates through which the patient must pass in order to live longer and well.\",\n",

       "  \"“The name vI'yolIn is also applied in incantations to various ‘spirits’ who are called to give help. For instance, the man repeating an incantation says, 320 ‘I want to employ you as an “assistant.” To be sure, whom else can I employ? You are the best for me.’ From this point of view, every protecting or helping ‘spirit,’ or even its image or a protecting amulet, would be called vI'yolIn.... Fig. 226, for example, is an image of a helping ‘spirit’ belonging to TIwlIlku't, a Chukchee of the Anadyr. It has a human face, and is arranged to be used like a divining-stone; that is, it can be suspended and used for foretelling the future by the way it swings. The owner called the image his ‘assistant’ for hunting walrus. He said that the ‘assistant’ lived in the region of the sky, and that his name was Te'gret (‘the descending one’).”\",\n",

       "  'Among the Aymara, soul concepts are confusing. The soul and ghost are clearly defined and while the ghost is generally feared, the soul is not. On occasion the soul of a living person may leave the body and be lost or captured. After death, the soul survives in the afterworld, sometimes returning to its former habitat to protect its living relatives, or, if they merit it, to punish them. As noted above, ghosts are greatly feared. They may appear to the living as corpses or dogs. \"Desiccated human flesh from old graves is sometimes eaten when prescribed by a doctor as a prophylactic against ghosts and sickness caused by ghosts\" (1: Tschopik, p. 553).',\n",
       "  'Sicknesses are believed to be always caused by supernatural forces, principally by “the dead” ( 2 . Cf. “Religion; The concept of Death” /see 2: Reichel-Dolmatoff in this file/. Some informants added a very interesting observation here. They said “Before, there were no illnesses. Illness came with the plants. They brought it with the plants, from the sky.” ), and are always interpreted as punishments and never as a malicious or inimical attack. Any of the personifications of the religion, the Fathers, Mothers, Masters or Heiséi (Death), can send these evils, which then come with the winds, principally with the “blue wind.” For this reason sickness itself is designated as “an ill wind,” a substance like a “seed” which impregnates a person and which, after a brief period of incubation, appears with its symptoms. All illnesses are classified according to the four colors, white, red, black and blue, no matter from what direction it is believed they might have come. Only illnesses of “light colors,” such as white and red, are believed curable; but illnesses which are diagnosed as of “dark color,” that is to say, black or blue, are believed fatal. The Kógi believe that the whites classify illnesses in the same way since they have heard them talk of “yellow fever” and the “red curse” ( 3 . Dysentery. ). Fevers are for them, 274 of course, “red” sicknesses, since they are “hot.” Exhaustion, lack of appetite, lack of strength, thinness, debility, “headache,” are regarded as “black” or “blue” illnesses. In digestive disturbances, which are very frequent, the illness is classified according to the color of the excrement, which is always examined carefully, and perhaps the classification by colors is derived from such examinations. Perhaps the most feared sickness is dysentery ( 1 . Apparently only amoebic dysentery exists. ), since the loss of blood means that “the body is drying up.” In order to produce more blood, the sick person swallows water in great quantities. The Kógi men complain frequently of “headache,” and this same “ache” is often mentioned as the cause of death among adult men. The women do not appear to suffer from this ailment, which leads one to believe that it is associated with the use of coca.',\n",
       "  'In addition to these must be mentioned the Munoh Antu, or Bepantap Buyu (“killing the demon,” or “wounding Buyu”). Buyu is the name of the evil spirit who brings many diseases and causes miscarriage in women. When there is some unusual or obstinate disease, or when a woman has had miscarriage, the manangs declare that Buyu is the cause of the trouble, and must be killed. A large number of witch-doctors are called together, and the feat is performed in this way: The patient is taken out of the room, and laid on the common veranda, and covered with a net. In the room is placed an offering of food, and the manangs walk in procession up and down the whole length of the house, chanting their incantations, and inviting the evil spirit to come to his victim, and also to partake of the sumptuous repast that is prepared for him. This occupies some time, for the spirit may be far away, on a journey, or fishing, or hunting. All lights are extinguished, and in the darkness the manangs walk up and down the public hall of the Dyak house. At intervals one of them peeps in at the door to see if the spirit has arrived. In due time the demon comes, and then the manangs themselves enter the darkened room. Presently sounds of scuffling, of clashing of weapons, and of shouting are heard by the Dyaks outside. Soon after the door is thrown open, and the demon said to be dead. He was cheated into coming to torment his prey, and instead of a week and helpless victim he met the crafty and mighty manangs, who have done what ordinary mortals cannot do--attacked and killed him. As a proof of the reality of the deed lights are brought in, and the manangs point to spots of blood on the floor, and occasionally to the corpse itself in the shape of a dead monkey or snake, which they say was the form the spirit took for the occasion. The trick is a very simple one. Some time in the day the manangs procure blood from a fowl or some other animal, or it may be from their own bodies, mix it with water in a bamboo to prevent congealing, smuggle it into the room, and scatter it on the floor in the dark. This can safely be done, as no one but the manangs themselves are in the room. Neither lights nor outsiders are admitted, on the plea that under such circumstances the demon could not be enticed to enter. The trick has often been detected and the performers openly accused of imposture; consequently, it is not now practised so often as in former times. When this victory over the spirit is won, the Pelian goes on in the usual way till the morning hours.',\n",

The pain made it impossible for her to sleep, so she was treated by covering the burn with the usual mixture of clay, turtle fat and honey, and exposing it to hot smoke. The smoke was provided by burning the fresh seeds of a creeper, each as big as a horse-chestnut and of the same colour, but of a lenticular shape. Incisions are made in the seeds to prevent explosion, and they are laid on the fire where they give out a thick smoke. The injured foot was held as close to the fire as possible.

The spirit `Dan Musa, angered at this result to his “mount,” afflicted Tinay's little daughter with stomach trouble. Tinay, therefore, came to Ku'ba and was told to buy the speckled cock requïred by this spirit as a sacrifice. She neglected this advice, whereupon her daughter became more seriously ill with c'oc'a , 31 C'oca' means, literally, “milking” and is therefore a disease appropriate to 'Inna, a Fulani milkmaid. It seems to be a kind of paralysis. caused by `Inna, the mother of `Dan Musa. In giving this account, it was emphasized that Ku'ba herself had not sought to inflict any harm on the girl, but that the bori who were “on her head” took this means of avenging the insult offered to their “mount.” Thereupon, Ku'ba's daughter-in-law came to her again, and was told that a bori performance was necessary, and that she must have a white sheep for `Inna, a black cock for Gajimari, a speckled cock for Duna and a red and white cock for K'ak'ari.

To prevent snow blindness ( t sâlbme-sud'dom ; t sâlmiht suovgâ h tuvveh , I. t salm eh koddojeh ) in early spring, the Lapps remain in a dark stable or look inside through a steaming sheep-barndoor until their eyes begin to fill with tears. If there are no sheep, they will wash their eyes with their own, warm urine, as many as three or four times a day. Other Lapps dye a piece of cotton fabric black and make a cap ( peäi've-suo 'gâ ) which they press down to the nostrils on bright days. The ordinary cap is placed on top of the black one (I. reind.-L.). Snow blindness may also be avoided if the eyes are not washed between February and Midsummer (I. fisher-L.), or if the lower eyelid is covered with soot (E.). The Utsjoki-Lapps used alum water. 1 ANDELIN, Oulun Lehti, 1881, n:o 1. -- A few drops of mother's milk are dripped into a sore eye, after which it is covered with a woolen cloth and blown upon. Another method is to throw cold water in the patient's eyes unexpectedly, e.g. when he opens a door (U.). If the disease of the eyes is due to cold, they should be rubbed with the water obtained by boiling white, black and red stones. 2 ANDELIN, Oulun Lehti, 1881, n:o 1. A kind of cataract ( tsâlmi l anstârduvveh ) may form in the eyes in clear spring weather. When the patient enters a smoky hut, the cataract will break as a result of the flow of tears, and it is licked away (I. reind.-L.). The real cataract ( smäi'ti ) is healed by boiling birchashes in water. When the dregs have settled a pin is dipped into the surface layer (= lye) and one drop is let fall on the cataract. A minute amount of mercury has the same effect (U.). Formerly a louse was placed in the eye; it was believed to wear out the cataract when it moved. 3 Oulun W.-S. 1857, n:o 34. Tobacco-spittle may also be put in an eye afflicted with a cataract. 1 OINONEN, Kolmen valtaku nan ota-Lappia, p. 169.

The manang is expected to effect a cure by identifying the cause and determining the site of the complaint in his batu ilau before removing from the patient's body the physical token deposited by the spirit. The token may be almost anything: a piece of wood or cloth, perhaps translated as a squirrel's hair ( bulu tupai ) or the sting of a bee ( butoh manyi ). The rite itself is simple. The manang bites the blade of a knife for strength; he also puts to his mouth the objects from his box with which he strokes the patient to discover the place of the illness.

       "  'The same truth is evident in all the Santal’s dealings with things that he cannot understand. The attitudes summed up in the terms “magic” and “religion” are both in evidence. It is not usual in these days to distinguish sharply between them. 3 Cf. G. and M. Wilson, The Analysis of Social Change, Cambridge University Press, 1945, p. 72: “Magic for us, though it may not postulate any transcendent reality, is an integral part of primitive religion.” Magic is used by the Santal as a tool to accomplish many and varied ends. It is not absent from his dealings with the spirits, and it can be used for social as well as antisocial ends. It does consequently overlap the sphere of “religion”, which, however, covers experiences where the arts of magic do not reach, while magic also works independently in some situations. For the most part, the various approaches to the problems of living are simultaneously pursued, by individuals as well as by society. “Charms” are in almost universal use as a precaution against sickness; one finds the shell of a land tortoise hung in the cowshed to ward off smallpox, or cowrie shells worn as a protection against the evil eye, and amulets worn round the arm as a matter of routine and called ran, or medicine. A double attitude is most apparent in efforts to control the weather that plays so great a rôle in their life. In a period of great drought the Santals probably arrange for a special festival to be held, with sacrifices offered to the “Five”. At the same time they busy themselves in other ways which are quite independent of the sacrifice. Unmarried girls plaster the dancing floor with cowdung, while the married women do the same to their own courtyards. An investigation is made as to whether any woman has tied a rope on any roof. It is taboo for women to climb on roofs in the ordinary way, but some of the cowsheds and outbuildings have low roofs on which it would be possible to tie the straw to a rafter without climbing up. If it transpires that any woman has done so, she is made to climb up on to the roof and undo her work, first removing her clothing. Other investigations are made too. It may be that someone has stored dried matkom on the floor in her house instead of placing it on a plank or on stones; or it may be that oil has been stored in a sealed pot, in which case the covering must be removed. Underlying all these activities is the conviction that the welfare of society and of the individual depends on establishing a balance between man, nature and the spirit world, and they witness to a faith that such a balance is possible of achievement.',\n",

       "  'The fibre of the Hibiscus is used mainly in the hunting of turtle and big fish. Consequently the tree itself from which the fibre is obtained is believed to possess the power of warding off all dangers connected with turtle and the sea. There is a custom that turtle flesh may only be cooked with wood of the Hibiscus , otherwise it will be uneatable. In the turtle-eating ceremony the initiate who, as we shall see later, is in a condition of danger by reason of having eaten turtle for the first time after a period of abstention, is seated on Hibiscus leaves and holds a bundle of the same leaves before him. At the same ceremony the leaves of this tree are used in the dance, and the initiate is given a skewer made from its wood with which to feed himself. If for any reason the leaves of the Hibiscus are not obtainable when the ceremony is performed those of the Myristica longifolia are used instead. Now this is the tree from which the natives always make their canoe paddles, which, like ropes of Hibiscus fibre, are used in hunting turtle. This specialisation is therefore easy to understand; the natives habitually make use of the Hibiscus and the Myristica in turtle-hunting; they use the intrinsic qualities of these trees in their actual struggles with turtle and large fish, and by means of these qualities they are able to succeed in overcoming their prey; they therefore come to believe that these trees possess special powers which not only enable them to conquer the turtle itself but also are able to protect them from the evil influences that they believe (for reasons to be explained later) result from the eating of its flesh.',\n",

       "  \"To the Layar-Skrang Iban the ayu is a ‘life’ which cannot be seen even by manang , though like the bungai , it is cared for by mythical shaman. Represented by a young plant placed in a jar in the bilek apartment, the ayu may be tended by a manang , then planted and fenced until it is well established. This rite is carried out for the ayu of children only; it is enacted if a child's growth or constitution is weak or if the child faces danger of contamination through another person's death (Uchibori 1978:25-26). The description of this protective rite for an endangered child recalls the pelian bejereki rite discussed earlier (Sandin 1978). In that instance, the sabang ayu was placed in the public gallery rather than the bilek , but it was subsequently planted outside as a visible symbol of the child's vitality and longevity. The use of a sabang cordyline plant in the pelian bejereki is consistent with the concern to establish a ‘ladder of the gods’ at the same time, while the rush or bamboo used by the Layar-Skrang Iban is consistent with their concern to evoke a cool/wet environment and, by analogy, ‘coolness/health’ in the socio-spatial setting of the bilek and longhouse group (Uchibori 1978:32). Despite such minor variations on the theme of health and security, I take the pelian bejereki rite (the report of which comes from the Rimbas, like the Layar a tributary of the (Saribas) as indicative of a similar concept and practice in relation to ayu throughout the Saribas-Skrang region.\",\n",

The Indians showed with apparent satisfaction even those cicatrices which the palometa fishes had inflicted on their body with their sharp teeth when they were bathing in the river. It is clear that according to the idea of the Indians not only the bleeding purges the body from impure matter and strengthens the limbs, but that the very scars which remain after the operation possess some mysterious power to keep off evil influences, a power which is much the same as that ascribed to real tattooing marks. This Indian view is especially conspicuous in regard to an operation which the whites sometimes perform upon Indians who have come in contact with European civilization, namely, vaccination. I could myself appreciate the extraordinary importance ascribed to scars when during my stay at Esperanza I vaccinated a number of Chaco Indians who were employed as labourers at the sugar factory. The Christians probably have no remedy which the natives understand so well as this one, and they therefore as a rule submitted to the vaccine inoculation without remonstration, in fact, with pleasure.

       "  \"To the Iban, then, the domain in which human beings live and the realm in which spirits ( antu ) roam are spatially coextensive although perceptually distinct: it is a different way of seeing which characterizes the spiritual vision of the world. Furthermore, as Freeman points out, ‘the Iban world view recognizes no firm boundary between phantasy and reality, between the imagined realm in which demons roam and the natural world of everyday experience’ (1967:317). It is in the context of this shared domain that the Iban seek to establish, by ritual means, barriers of limited provenance and application so as to separate or conceal particular elements of this multi-faceted environment, as and when they deem it necessary to do so. In this way, precautions may be taken against threatening antu , as well as against hazardous exposure to the dead. I have already discussed the shielding rites ( bedinding , literally, to make a protective wall) in which a shaman uses textiles to enclose an Iban woman threatened by an incubus, or applies a talisman ( engkerabun ) to make an Iban invisible to evil spirits and so cure him/her of bad dreams. Similarly, Heppell reports that after an ordeal by diving ‘all the supporters of the winning principal receive a payment ( lantan ) which is made to create a barrier across which any curses made by the loser cannot pass’ (1975:332 ch.9 n.1). The payment is thought to strengthen the souls of the victor's supporters, making them immune from the consequences of the loser's curse. Again, men leaving a graveyard after a burial perform acts intended as ‘the putting of a barrier between the world of the living and the Land of the Dead. For the border between the two realms has been dangerously opened by the digging of the grave’ (Uchibori 1978:68). Finally, when the troop of the dead come to collect the newly deceased, they find themselves unable to enter the longhouse, since ‘the entrance is blocked by a mythical shaman with ceremonial fabrics which have fearful designs of crocodiles and tigers’ (Uchibori 1978:184). When no such measures are taken, the border between the world of the living and that of the dead is said to be ‘[n]o thicker than the skin of the brinjil fruit’ (Freeman 1970:39) and as penetrable as ‘the inner skin of a lemayong fruit’ (Uchibori 1978:219). Likewise, a ritual chant describes the door of the sky as ‘thinner than the skin of a banana plant’ and ‘thinner than the skin of the fruit of an eggplant’ (Masing 1981:243). Nevertheless, this same door of the sky is simultaneously depicted, in the chant, as ‘a formidable door’ which only Lang Singalang Burong is powerful enough to break through (1981:243). Thus, even normally fragile borders may be metaphorically exploited as the means to represent superior skills.\",\n",
       "  \"“For the forerunners of death, accidents and sickness, the Eskimo knows of only one cause, the malignant activities of evil spirits or of the shades of the dead. Many of Higilak's seances in Victoria island were held for the purpose of propitiating or intimidating these shades and dispelling their influence. The natives have no knowledge whatever of medicine, and very little of surgery. A head-ache is sometimes cured by bleeding, broken limbs are set in splints and frozen members are amputated. Aksiatak, for example, disloc ated his ankle while wrestling in the dance-house; he pulled it back into place, covered it with a long deerskin sock and laid three splints around it, one on each side and one at the back, keeping them firmly in place by means of a raw-hide lashing; a second cord running from his hand to the sole of his foot enabled him to raise his leg without bending it. A year later his son Nakitok fell from the roof and broke his thigh; the Eskimos set his leg in splints also. Both accidents were ascribed to the machinations of evil spirits and the shamans were asked to appease them. A painful swelling on the arm of the old shaman Ilatsiak was cured by lancing. For snow-blind-ness the natives use counter-irritants, flooding the eyes with the smoke of burning heather or of the Dryas integrifolia, or tying a louse to a thread and letting it scratch the sclerotis. Complaints that are considered magical in their origin, however, find their surest remedies in counter-magic, so a shaman is usually called in at once to diagnose the cause and prescribe a cure.

Her food at two or three rupees per month ‘because she was ill and could not work’. 2. Cloth - if the girl was ill for a long time and a new cloth became necessary. 3. Medical treatment including the cost of roots and powders (if purchased), the ojha’s fee and the value of the sacrificial animals. * The ojhas fees are normally five four anna bits in minor cases and five rupees in major. Further fees, however, may be settled by private negotiation and the number of sacrificial animals also varies with the illness and the ojha. At the time of visiting parents-in-law for taking a wife back after illness, an account is struck and the husband must then meet it. If he does not, the girl’s parents can detain her at their house and if the husband still does not pay the charges and take her to his house his conduct gives a valid action for divorce.',\n",
       "  \"The other way in which a person joins the bori cult is as a result of an illness caused by the spirits. After all kinds of remedies have been tried, it is customary to consult the “children of the bori .” A “child of the bori ” under possession tells the sick person that his only hope of recovery is initiation into the bori cult, since one particular spirit has caused the illness to indicate his desire for the victim as his “mount.” The prescribed initiation rite is then carried out as soon as possible, because, as the natives phrased it in the case of one “daughter of the bori,” “she has the spirits on her head but she doesn't know their work.”\",\n",

In other words, it is not the pagar api that is used for this purpose. Furthermore, Uchibori's explanation is specific to the Layar-Skrang concept of the bungai as a plant growing at the foot of the fireplace post. As we have seen, the Baleh Iban have no such precariously positioned plant form, as their ayu -cum- bungai are located solely on a far-off mountainside. Yet the pagar api is so named and common to manang rites in the Baleh as well as the Layar-Skrang.

The balubaale usually produce illnesses which are not susceptible to medicine but require the process of ‘settling’.

Thus, although less violent, the illnesses the balubaale produce are more difficult to cure and consequently many say that they are the most dangerous (Note 28 Note — It must be emphasised that ideas of causation are vague and it is impossible to draw up an ordered system.

The most natural thing that one wants from him is dryness for clearing the fields, and furthermore that the heat will not be too great, in the wider sense rain. He in fact accomplishes all this, induced to do so by the masks representing him or related to him. But he is also capable of other services, since still other things belong to him and start from him. Through his course in the sky he can see to it that the sicknesses do not approach from the four cardinal points and that the directions, that is, the world, do not collapse. Sicknesses particularly, which can be summed up in the term fever-heat, are directly from the nature of the sun’s heat. Therefore they are also called mulbatá, from the stem mul, mun (white, gleaming, hot) ( 1 .

To determine this is extremely difficult, because I only saw one festival, which nevertheless must be regarded as an especially favorable event, and otherwise we must refer to isolated statements; also many acts are not limited to a festival, and statements about time may easily be subject to error. In addition some songs stem from unfamiliar villages, whose festivals the informant could not have known in detail; others again are no longer celebrated, and formerly there was surely a much greater number of festivals. If we first exclude the family festivals, which are to be dealt with in the next chapter, it appears merely from the content of many 107 songs and the statements given in connection with them, as well as from the purposes of many of the little magic stones, that they were used only for events in the life of an individual and for sporadic occasions not bound to any specific time, such as, for example, the curing of sickness.

Almost all of the youth go barefoot a large part of the time, although sandals or shoes appear in the winter, usually without stockings. The infants and younger children are confined to the houses in extremely cold weather, and the problem for them does not exist. There is no specific time at which a youth or a maiden must put on adult attire. In the case of a girl, the parents insist on the veil whenever they feel the neighbors “might talk” if it was not worn. For the boys, the adulation of weapons has already been noticed, and is coupled with a similar feeling toward the clothing of chieftains and their bodyguards, warriors full-blown in the eyes of adolescence. Hence the mother is under considerable pressure to influence the father for money to deck out his son in adult clothing. The young Kurd who follows a government career in the secondary schools and colleges of the cities soon learns to sublimate such notions to the condemning adjective baladi , “rustic,” although he may retain a certain admiration for the dashing garb of the heroes of his youth.\",\n",
       "  'In 1945, the Department of National Health and Welfare was organized to attend to the health needs of the Canadian population, including Inuit and Indians. Although many years would pass before any substantial progress was made to improve the deteriorating health of northern populations, the Northern Health Service branch immediately embarked upon a campaign against the infectious diseases, most notably TB, that were devastating the Inuit. The task, of course, was a formidable one given the total lack of medical facilities, the vast distribution of the population, and the high cost of transporting medical personnel throughout the arctic region. An energetic campaign of medical examinations, chest X-rays, innoculations, and vaccinations began in the late 1940s. In the Eastern Arctic, the C.D. Howe, a government vessel, carried medical equipment, supplies, and personnel to examine the populations of Northern Quebec and Baffin Island. Other medical teams were flown into the isolated areas of the Western Arctic. Individuals who were discovered to have tuberculosis were often flown out immediately to southern hospitals where they would frequently remain for years. A large portion of Holman residents over 30 years of age have spent varying lengths of time at Charles Camsell Hospital in Edmonton receiving medical treatment. One individual remained for nine years before he was healthy enough to return to his family and friends. In addition to the normal stresses and strains of prolonged hospital confinement, many of these patients had difficulty readjusting to settlement life upon their return. Separation was also extremely difficult for the families of hospitalized patients, and spouses would occasionally take on extramarital partners to curb their loneliness.',\n",

The Maguzawa say that all remedies have been revealed to men by the spirits, and this proposition is most clearly illuminated by considering bori possession. The illness which makes a devotee originally enter the cult is caused by a spirit. It is cured by an initiation which allows the spirit to possess the sick person at will, whereupon the “child of the bori ” can prescribe for all who suffer from the same disease. That the spirit gives the remedy is clear from the fact that ordinarily he himself reveals it to the sufferer, speaking through the mouth of his “mount.”',\n",

If the illness is brought by balubaale, then they will usually need to be appeased by a ceremony lasting several nights. This is termed ‘settling’ ( okutendeka ) the lubaale and may be considered as an initiation ceremony. If in fact the diagnosis has been correct, balubaale will possess the patient during this ceremony and will give further instructions as to what needs to be done to appease them. These illnesses are varied and often rather ill-defined. Occasionally the illness sounds like psychiatric depression, in which the patient sits around doing nothing and is not able to eat food. Western doctors will only be mystified by these illnesses and will be unable to cure them. Certain balubaale are associated with particular illnesses. For example Kawumpuli is associated with plague and Wanema with lameness ( obulema ). These balubaale are thought to have the power to bring the particular illness and to cure it, although a more philosophical Muganda said that some balubaale were named after powerful illnesses, the names being thought to be appropriate for powerful gods. This association of a lubaale with a particular illness is a different order of belief from that concerning the origin of the more ill-defined diseases.',\n",

The Chukchee regard it as indigenous, though its name.... ‘Chuvantzy....substance’....Suggests the tribe who in earlier times were mediators between the Russians and the Chukchee, and probably, after obtaining the disease from the Russians, introduced it among the Chukchee. However this may be, one afflicted with syphilis was regarded as unclean. At home he was provided with bedding of his own, with a separate dish and bowl, and was kept aloof, lest others should contract the disease. A family having several syphilitics among its older members was considered as ‘subject to shunning’....Their fire especially was regarded as tainted. They were not allowed admission into clean camps, lest the odor of their hearth and the shadow of their entrance might prove infectious to their neighbors. Nowadays syphilis has evidently decreased; but elderly men and women with deformed noses and ugly scars on their foreheads, showing the third stage of the disease, are frequently met with everywhere. Even now these are considered unclean, though the precautions against them are not observed. The outbreaks of syphilis which occasionally occur among the younger people are considered simply as a different sort of disease, milder and less contagious.”',\n",
       "  'Parents of a child who is prone to illness but not really kui mia: often approach a woman who has successfully reared several healthy children and ask her to take their daughter as a “dry daughter.” After a minor ritual and the exchange of gifts, the “dry mother” and her new daughter assume a mock parent-child relationship. In effect this amounts to little more than the “dry mother” including the child in family events like marriages, birthday celebrations, and feasts during religious festivals, and the child giving her “dry mother” little gifts and paying her visits. In some cases as the child grows older she outgrows the relationship and has little more to do with her “dry mother” than she does with other women. Often, however, a warm bond of affection develops between the “dry mother” and her charge, and the tie that was merely formal becomes real, lasting until death. In asking about the “dry mother” relationship in Peihotien, we discovered that it was not always initiated by the parents of an ailing child. Sometimes a woman who has a favorite among the children of a friend asks to be made her “dry mother.” One woman in Peihotien who had the misfortune to never bear children of her own had at least two “dry daughters” that we knew of; now adults, they were still frequent visitors to her home. We also found several cases in which older women who had become particularly fond of village teen-agers (and in one case of a young bride) formalized their relationships by referring to themselves and their favorites as “dry mother” and “dry daughter.”',\n",

The mother then goes and sits on a chair near the fire and is handed the baby to hold in her arms. She spreads her legs facing the fire to hasten the expulsion of the afterbirth. When this occurs a thread is used to tie the cord close to the baby's stomach. Then the measure of the distance between an outstretched thumb and the middle finger (a hoht ) is applied to the umbilical cord that has been tied. The cord is then cut at this distance, about six inches, from the thread. If the cord is cut short, then when the baby grows up it won't be able to shout very loud, an ability that is important for shouting communications across valleys, on the trail, and between houses. The afterbirth and what remains of the cord are put in the ashes next to the flames of the roaring fire and having dried a little are burnt.

In the present case we depend upon verbal contexts to establish relevance from the informant's point of view, and we use verbal contexts to test non-simulated performances in order to determine the salience of illness in the record of any situation we may be examining. One general measure of relevance is expressed in the Tzeltal question: /TUT LA SPAS/ “What happened to him” literally “What was he doing?” A further probe such as: /TUT+A CAMELIL YA YAI/ “What illness does he feel?” if it can be made relevant, is fairly likely to put the observer into the domain of illness as it is being experienced by some participant. If the illness is a non-simulated performance, further eliciting will produce further reports of states relevant in that domain. If the illness is a simulated performance, further well controlled eliciting will produce further relevant responses to the initial simulated performance. Such material, in conjunction with texts, constitutes the basis for the following survey of beliefs about illness.\",\n",

I have had occasion to test their attachment to these talismans. On one occasion at Bur Calli (near Tiglieglo) I noticed a Rahanuin native wearing a small, round stone pendant around his neck. I was unable to buy it at any price since it was a stone which had the power to ward off nosebleed ( ghersa nun ).

I saw one head-band of this kind worn by an old man among the Reindeer people on the Wolverene River. Head-bands with wooden images attached are 259 mentioned in several tales. Similar wooden manikins, forked at one end, may be seen on the breast-band of the women (Fig. 190, b).

       "  \"Although neither the gods nor the ancestors are conceived of as essentially malevolent, both are considered capable of inflicting misfortunes on the living. These misfortunes are always interpreted as punishment, but very different motives explain the penalties attributed to the gods and those attributed to the ancestors. Like their counterparts in the human bureaucracy, the gods are thought of as proud and exceedingly jealous of their prerogatives. Any derogation of their high status is likely to bring a quick and angry response. A few years ago a man in Hsia-ch'i-chou fell at a fire-walking and was so badly burned that he later died of his wounds. Some of his neighbors now say that the god was punishing him for having failed to observe three days of sexual abstinence prior to the event. “The god was angry because that man came there dirty.” Another man in the same village suffers from severe palsy, which people say is a consequence of his having made fun of a god he saw at a procession when he was a child. That this view of the gods was widespread in traditional China is suggested by Mrs. William L. Pruen's comments on the death of one of her neighbor's children in Chengtu: “At another home in this compound a little fellow, about eleven years of age, was suddenly taken dangerously ill. The poor boy was very worried because he had in some way insulted an idol shrine and thought he was being punished for his fault. He died the next day.” (Pruen 1906: 101–2.)\",\n",
       "  'This completes the analysis of demographic structure and culture. The previous chapter has shown how fertility with a balanced sex ratio at birth and free or captive female in-migration for marriage changed the age-sex distribution of the Mucajai group, especially by reducing the imbalanced sex ratio of the reproductive population. This chapter has shown how a changed age-sex structure has, in turn, changed the intensity of two cultural patterns. There was an increase in monogamous marriages and a corresponding decrease in polyandrous marriages. Where wife-sharing was retained, there was a diminution of the number of males in the sharing networks. The change in the Table 9.5 Schematic of Principal Demographic and Cultural Changes age--sex distribution also diminished the age difference between marital partners. This, in turn, increased the age differences between mothers-in-law and sons-in-law, thereby reducing potential sexual conflict within family groups. As a result the avoidance patterns between mothers-in-laws and sons-in-laws have diminished. Table 9.5 gives a synoptic view of these changes. In brief, the synthetic section has shown how culture affects the demographic structure of a population (Chapter 8), and how this, in turn, affects the intensity of some cultural patterns (Chapter 9).',\n",

Quarrels are continually going on between neighbors on account of mutual accusations. Several of the people that I knew were given new derisive names on account of their thieving exploits. One was called “Knee-Walker’....because he was once accused of crawling on all-fours to his neighbor's herd in the calving-season with the intention of taking away some of the new-born fawns.

       "  \"The way the Andamanese think about the spirits is shown in the Akar-Bale legend of the origin of death. 1 Page 216. Yaramurud , having died through an accident, self-caused, becomes a spirit, but he does so only under the compulsion exercised upon him by his mother, who, now that he is dead, insists that he must go away from the world of the living and become a spirit. The spirit then comes back to see his brother and by this contact causes the brother's death. The story implies that it was not because Yaramurud was evilly disposed towards his brother that he killed him, but on the contrary it was his attachment to his relative that caused him to return to visit him, and death followed as a result of this contact of the living man with the spirit. Since that time deaths have continued to occur in the same way. Thus it appears that the Andamanese conceive that the spirits do not cause death and sickness through evil intention, but through their mere proximity, and, as the legend very clearly shows, the burial customs are intended to cut off the unwilling spirit from contact with the living. This explains also why during the period of mourning the relatives of a dead person are thought to be in danger of sickness, and have more to fear from the spirit than others, for since it is they who were most attached to him during life it is they who are most likely to suffer from contact with him after he is dead. It was Yaramurnd's brother who was the first to die through the influence of the spirits.\",\n",

       "  'The third case was the most dramatic of all. In 1929 a son of the Ariki Tafua fell ill and the chief became very disturbed about this. He had been baptized as a Christian, but this had not meant that he had abandoned all belief in the reality of his traditional gods and spirits. He regarded the illness of his son as due to the action of some malicious spirits, and seeing his son get weaker and imagining that he would die he attempted suicide by hanging (p. 138). This was a despairing act given the rationalization of shaming his traditional gods for not looking after his family. When his suicide attempt had been prevented (and it was never quite clear how far the chief had hoped it would be prevented) he addressed his gods, reproaching them for wanting to take the life of a young man while he himself, an old man, still remained. According to Tikopia belief, in response to this reproach the gods allowed his son to recover, but made the chief himself ill. From this illness he was in turn in Tikopia eyes saved by the effort of his peers, the Ariki Kafika and Ariki Taumako, both pagan chiefs, who visited him and laid hands on him. In the course of the rites which accompanied these proceedings the Ariki Tafua, who was a spirit medium, twice entered the trance state, and in spirit form gave utterance to reassuring statements. But the day before he became ill he had also had a trance and in spirit form spoke to the assembled company, saying ‘Who is the man who told the chief that he should hang himself?’ The spirit appeared to be very angry. His eldest son and another senior man crawled across the floor of the house to him, and pressed their noses one to each of his knees in token of obeisance. Then they and all the others present in the house assured the spirit that he was mistaken, that it had been the idea of the chief himself alone that he should commit suicide, that no one else had advised him to do so. At last the spirit appeared to be appeased and the trance ended.',\n",
       "  \"If, in Ch'inan, sons gain a significant measure of authority at the death of their fathers and mothers, then the first premise of the Goody argument holds here. A [See Cat. 121, pp. 191-192 -- Analyst] Does his conclusion--that misfortune will be laid to the hostile acts of ancestors--also hold in this instance? As we have seen, Freedman characterizes the behavior expected of Chinese ancestors as “essentially benign.” But it is my impression that ancestors in Ch'inan are much more active and interfering than this. Unfortunately, I am unable to say to the exact percentage point how many misfortunes are attributed to the ancestors, for I have no record of the advice people received on their frequent trips to consult professionals in Sanhsia or Panch'iao (near Taipei). In the village itself, I attended almost every session at which a shaman attempted to determine the cause of some ill. Six of them were prolonged sessions, some lasting over several days, and involved cases of serious or intractable illness. Two of these cases were diagnosed as instances of ancestral interference; one was held to be the work of an ancestor in the hall, the other the work of an ancestor in the grave. But the frequency with which ancestors are blamed for misfortune is surely much higher than this suggests, because many out-of-town shamans tend to blame misfortune on the ancestors, and geomancers, who are resorted to very often, inevitably relate their interpretations to the personal activities of ancestors.\",\n",

       "  \"Disease, health, or death are also the result of magic or counter-magic. The Trobrianders have a very complex and very definite set of theoretical views on these matters. Good health is primarily of course the natural, normal state. Minor ills may be contracted by exposure, over-eating, over-strain, bad food, or other ordinary causes. Such ailments never last, and have never any really bad effects, nor are they of immediate danger. But, if a man sickens for any length of time, and his strength seems to be really sapped, then the evil forces are at work. By far the most prevalent form of black magic, is that of the bwaga'u , that is the black sorcerer, of whom there are a number in each district. Usually even in each village there are one or two men more or less dreaded as bwaga'u . To be one does not require any special initiation except the knowledge of the spells. To learn these--that is, to learn them in such a manner as to become an acknowledged bwaga'u --can only be done by means of high payment, or in exceptional circumstances. Thus, a father will often “give” his sorcery to his son, always, however, without payment; or a commoner will teach it to a man of rank, or a man to his sister's son. In these two latter cases a very high payment would have to be given. It is important as a characteristic of the kinship conditions of this people, that a man receives sorcery gratis from his father, who according to the traditional kinship system is no blood-relation, whereas he has to pay for it to his maternal uncle, whose natural heir be is.\",\n",

These malignant beings have a permanent abode in the south. Occasionally they will move to the Trobriand Archipelago, and, invisible to ordinary human beings, they walk at night through the villages rattling their lime-gourds and clanking their wooden sword clubs. Wherever this is heard fear, falls upon the inhabitants, for those whom the tauva'u strike with their wooden weapons die, and such an invasion is always associated with death in masses. Leria , epidemic disease, obtains then in the villages. The malignant spirits can sometimes change into reptiles and then become visible to human eyes.

       "  'Comparison of the pre-Islamic Somali spirit-world with Muslim angelology and demonology reveals again the much higher degree of systematization in the latter. In Muslim theology, angels, pre-eminent amongst whom is Gabriel, generally figure as Divine Messengers created by God to serve and worship Him. They are charged with recording man’s actions in this life, receiving his soul in heaven, and acting as his counsel on the day of judgment. On the other hand, jinn are those rebellious spirits created similarly to man, but of fire in place of earth, and committed to Solomon’s keeping, who seek to lead man astray and to subvert the teachings of the prophets. It is as jinn that the majority of pre-Islamic spirits previously associated with Waaq are assimilated in Islam. This is illustrated in the following tale current among the Gasar Gudda tribe of Somalia. ‘Solomon, son of David, on whom be peace, commanded all men, all the animals, the wind, spirits, and demons, the entire kingdom of the Great King. One day the jinn were at work as usual, and Solomon, leaning against a tree, seemed to be watching them although he gave no sign of repose. Solomon was dead, but remained supported by the tree while the jinn unaware of what had happened went on with their work. At last the termites succeeded in eating their way through Solomon’s support precipitating him heavily on to the ground. The jinn quickly ran to the spot and saw that the son of David was dead. They began to rejoice for now they could stop working since their master was dead. They hastened to the termites and made a pact with them, saying, “You make your nest of earth and we will bring the water for its strengthening”. From this time forth jinn and termites are in alliance’ (Ferrandi, 1903, p. 309). Here within Islam the spirits attendant upon the mysterious construction of termite mounds are associated with jinn in Solomon’s keeping. The relation ‘spirits—termites’ is given Muslim sanction in Solomon’s authority over jinn . Similarly the source of the efficacy of divination, ordeals, charms, and prophylactic amulets has been transferred from Waaq to Allah when beneficent and to jinn when mischievous or evil. Now the favourite amulet is the Sufi rosary ( tusbah ) whose 99 beads remind the believer of the innumerable praise-names of Allah and help him to perform his prayer-tasks. Perhaps equally popular as amulets are small leather pouches armed with inscriptions from the Koran. Thus phenomena which formerly owed their power to some connexion with Waaq now originate in Allah, the ultimate source of all power. 1 cf. the fate of the pre-Islamic Gods and spirits in Arabia, Koran, Sura XXXVII. For general indications of the universality of such syncretisms in Islam, see Gibb, 1947, 23 ff.; Miliot, 1949, 643. Saar spirits are described by Somali as a kind of jinn . The whole spirit hierarchy of Waaq is being progressively Islamized. This is a process which naturally also applies to God’s attributes. Among the Gasar Gudda, again, the rainbow, from being the Sky God’s belt, has become the path good souls take to heaven, although it is also contended by some to be the smoke made by rain falling upon termite hills. Rain-drops are believed to turn into angels (an understandable evaluation); thunder ( uri ) is the voice of angels ( malaika ) or the noise of their combat in striving to stop rain. Lightning ( birk ) darts forth from the armpits of melek Mikail, the archangel Michael. 1 Ferrandi, 1903, 298 ff. Michael ( Sura, II) appears thus to be taken as a symbol of war. These are a few examples indicative of the way in which the Muslim spirit hierarchy is understood in terms of Cushitic cosmology.',\n",
       "  'In the towns one finds Arabs who fill the office of muéddsin [Ed., muezzin ?] and qudhât . Special priests (wodadín) roam through the countryside, usually traveling through a region with a number of other priests, performing the functions of their office and lining their pockets in the process. They have no influence whatever on the people. Superstition flourishes in the most luxuriant forms, but I would say that even this has no significance whatever, because the natives content themselves entirely with copied amulets and the like. Belief in sorceresses ( komâju, sorceress) is to be encountered here and there since, after all, every old woman is surrounded by the aura of being able to perform sorcery. The Somâli swears an oath (dâr) on the Koran, and the Ogadên on the head of his children and wives. Breach of promise with respect to the Whites or the enemy, however, is no crime. The prayer times are those of all Islamites (9:30, súbbeh; noon, dóhur; 3:30, ássur; 6:30, mágrib; and eight o’clock, asâ ); they are observed only by the most pious. Attempts to convert the Somâl to the Christian religion have never been seriously undertaken. In Zeila, to be sure, a magnificent house has been built for the French Mission, but not in the hope of being able to win the Somâl for Christendom. The building is supposed to serve merely as a way station for missionaries going off to Galla country. The universal complaint is that the Somâli curtly turns away the European apostle of the faith and that, in view of the people’s nomadic way of life, the latter is unable to step in to civilize the natives by getting them in the habit of working regularly. None of the religious ideas of the Galla has been incorporated by the Somâl. Except to celebrate Ramadan there are no festive periods. I heard nothing about divine judgments among the western Somâl tribes. The times of year are mostly distinguished according to the rainy seasons in the manner already indicated, but between these there are also shorter periods ( bil, month) by which time is occasionally reckoned. Their names are not generally known ( 73 . The names of the months given by Haggenmacher, op. cit., p. 28, are not all known to the Ejssa, so I must assume that they are perhaps valid for only a small group of coastal inhabitants. The Êjssa and Hábr Auál use the following designations for the months: dúggo (November), bil dúrroh hôra (December), bil dúrroh dámba (January), rajâl hôra (February), rajâl dáha (March), rajâl dámba (April), sáboh (May), wa báris (June), sunkât (July), sunfûr (August), sid atâl (September), aráfo (October). ).',\n",

Illness of this kind represents a supernatural sanction that punishes improper behavior and therefore is an important instrument of social control. In some cases the cure for the problem is accomplished through confession and public acknowledgment of the transgression. For example, the i soro (a ritual of reconciliation and apology) requires openly expressed contrition (Arno 1976; Koch et al. 1977). Also, one informant told me that when a person is suffering a long, painful, and lingering death, that too may be in punishment for secret misdeeds, and after it becomes apparent what is happening, a relative will go to the person and ask if he or she has anything to tell. If he or she confesses, a peaceful death ensues.',\n",

Kaggwa says that in Busiro the Twins were cared for as though they were “the living kings themselves” ([1907] 1934: 129). Today, attendants at the royal shrines refer to the Twin as the “Kabaka.” They also refer to the base (containing the umbilical-cord stump) as the Twin’s “stomach” and to the loop handle as its “arms.” When the Twin is wrapped in barkcloth, they say that it is “dressed.” Like a human twin, the royal Twin is also wrapped in bbombo vine on ceremonial occasions; and like the living king, the royal Twin is carried on the right shoulder of its bearer (Plates 7 and 8).',\n",
       "  'The best proof of the consistency with which the Kágaba have developed their view of the mastery of the demons is given by the existence of the Hiséi mask, that is, the mask-demon of the dead. Without knowing the activity of this mask, one would have to assume, according to previous information, that here the dead or death-demon would be used in order to save people from death. To be sure, that is not given directly from the tasks of the mask, but from the remarkable name hiséi huvéi for all kinds of the magical stone powder wrapped in maize leaves 2 . Ahuba = covering. , which is used for the most varied protective purposes, but especially as a means against sickness and to drive away death. A means against death is at the same time a means of death, just as a song against a demon is a song of the mask-demon concerned. Now the Hiséi mask is a demon who has to look after all the preparations for festivals, in particular the festive foods. Among these, moreover, the food for christenings is mentioned in particular ( 27, 2), which, like the complete act of christening, is intended for keeping the newborn child alive. Furthermore, the hut for the first cohabitation of newlywed couples is called hiséi huvéi, like the stone powder in its wrapper, for here, as at the christening, it is used to preserve future life. And finally it is one of the foremost tasks at any festival to protect the dancers and the whole village from sickness. We must assume that the festive foods also serve this purpose more than would appear at first glance. A particular concern of the Hiséi mask is therefore a concern about the canchi fruit, which is used as festive food, to which there belongs a special two-day dance so that the fruit may not be eaten by animals. If one recalls the heavenly origin of this fruit and the detailed narrative about its spread across the land of the Kágaba ( 5, 23 ff.), one may deduce from that its importance as a festive food, and, to be sure, its importance for health, because it is the “death mask” which has assumed concern for it. Among other things the Hiséi mask says: “Sweep in front of the temple, sweep the rubbish together well, so that no puma and no snake may eat me, (for) I fear them” ( 31, 5). That means, speaking from the developmental history of this demon: The sweeping in front of the temple 91 must be done so that no sickness may come, for the puma personifies these. And in connection with the snake, one can probably think immediately of the deadly bite of the poisonous snakes, which are quite common there. Since his mask with the snout-like jaw and the big teeth in it is supposed to represent the puma and on both sides it bears a carved snake (Ill. 31), this clearly expresses the fact that the snake is part of his character, just as sickness is. Since the all-mother herself attends to all ceremonies (p. 97), he comes here from her for the festival and then returns to her in his temple-mountain ( 31, 7). He lives with her, as does the priestly demon Muluku, who is related to him (p. 136). And just as the latter formerly lived on earth, the Hiséi mask was already taking care of the canchi fruit “when he was still a man,” that is, when he was still alive ( 27, 2). This mask too thus belongs among the activity-demons, as did the preceding beings, because it personifies the human means against sickness and death, but it no longer rests on nature. The new foundation is an abstract one: death or the dead.',\n",
       "  'It has already been mentioned that at Osiwasiu on Kaileuna the pig is linked with the bird totems of the Malawi, Lukuba and Lukosisiga clans. It was said that in this village no one would eat wild pig, for if they did their bellies would swell up, but they would sometimes hunt bush pig and sell it to another village, such as Boitaru on Kiriwina, where wild pig was eaten. Further, men of all clans of Osiwasiu would eat village pig, whatever it color, but no one ate dog, though everyone, including the Lukuba men, kept dogs. At Osiwasiu it was said that no one of either sex would eat shark of sting-ray, and though there is not reason to believe that these prohibitions can be directly referred to totemism at the present day, they are included here since they may be supposed to have been connected therewith at one time. 1 The following avoidance may be noted here, although it probably has nothing to do with totemism. Certain fish are only eaten by only men; it was believed that if unmarried or only recently married men ate these they would become unpleasant to the opposite sex who would not then permit free access. The fish which were avoided for this reason were kurasi, mamila, milabwaga, sigau, and iabobo. There were no birds which were avoided on their account.',\n",

The consequences of such transgressions can be transferred to the child. For example, if a pregnant woman looks at a squirrel (which is taboo) her baby will be born with a deformed mouth. The transgression of some taboo can produce physical and mental disability. Nevertheless, and this is the main point, individuals are not always aware of the taboo they have transgressed. 68 Some important taboos connected with the village deity are well known, but the Santals have to respect a greater number of more particular taboos associated with rituals and specific clans. These later taboos are known but often forgotten. The ojha will have to include this possibility among the causes of misfortune. Finally, the Santal attribute the origin of some disease to some malevolent deities or bonga which live in stagnant waters or in the forest. Such a deity as Nage Era 69 This tribal deity who inflicts leprosis is found in the respective pantheons of three munda tribes: the Mundas, the Hos and the Santals. inflicts leprosy on people who admire their mirror image in ponds, while forest deities cast their shadow on travellers and drive them mad.

For the first child the basket must be kept longer than for subsequent children. After 100 days the father throws the first child's basket over the reef into the sea, and frequently marks the spot with a tabu stick. Nobody may fish there until after the ceremony which celebrates the child's first birthday. The father does not need to erect a tabu stick, but if he does so he is obliged to give a big feast when the tabu is lifted. The feast adds to his prestige, as well as that of the child and of his clan. The excrement basket for a subsequent offspring need be kept only until the child shows that he is gaining strength. It is discarded in the sea without a tabu and no ceremony is held on the child's first birthday.\",\n",

There are several works available which include chapters on the traditional beliefs of the Baganda and so it is only necessary to summarise these and in places to clarify the picture. The Baganda believe in several forms of spirits; balubaale (hero-gods), mayembe (literally meaning horns, but referring to spirits residing in horns or other receptacles), mizimu (the ghosts of dead ancestors), misambwa (spirits associated with certain animals, rivers, rocks or forests) and kitambo (a spirit usually causing people to walk naked at night and eat dead bodies). Difficulties arise when discussing the cause of illnesses with patients and their families as Bennett et al. (1964) discovered when asking about childhood diarrhoea. Although relatives admitted that a possible cause was obusobe, a ritual mistake made in pregnancy or infancy ( obusobya, a mistake) none admitted that this was the reason for their own child’s diarrhoea. The Baganda do, in fact, have a proverb ‘Lubaale agoba nsonga’ nga takutidde wuwo . (A Lubaale punishes with reason, provided that it has not killed one of your own relatives). Although there are said to be some diseases which result from the breaking of certain taboos, it does not seem to be an important reason in these days. Amakiro is thought to be brought by committing adultery during pregnancy and a rash may be caused in infants because the mother ate salt during the pregnancy (Note 15 Note — Southwold (1959, p. 45) also found this. He says that although one reads of such illnesses in the literature, “I never heard of a specific case of anyone with the disease, and when I approached it from the other end, by asking what would happen if anyone did break the taboo, people were pretty sceptical whether anything would.” He says also (p. 46) “People will tell you that buko is an illness that people get through committing incest, but when you ask what happens to a man who commits incest and is not prosecuted they will say “nothing.”.” ).',\n",

He notes that incensing was done by putting coals from the fire near the southwest lodge pole, then putting sweetgrass on the coals and passing objects from the altar over the smoke, waving them toward the southwest. Participants in the ceremony also passed the smoke over their bodies. Parks adds: In addition to offering sweet smelling smoke to the deities, the incensing act also put the smoke between the objects and participants in the ceremony and the deity of disease who stood in the southwest. This god did not like the odor of sweetgrass: it was sweet and he liked the odor of only unclean things. Hence by performing the rite in the southwest of the lodge and by waving objects in that direction, it was believed that the deity of disease was pushed farther from the village and that the village itself was thereby freed from disease [Murie 1981:16].',\n",

A shaman must diagnose the cause and sometimes figuratively pull the spirit or demon out, often with the help of his own spirits. To prepare, a shaman frequently decorates himself and his surroundings handsomely and invariably inhales a hallucinogenic snuff to aid contact with the HEKIRA. Illness may also be caused by the breach of a ritual regulation or taboo. The Yanoama also employ a variety of herbal remedies as cures.',\n",
       "  'Buganda’s borders were also maintained through ritual means. Human and animal victims, called byonzire, were taken across the border to Bunyoro and Busoga and sacrificed, both to rid Buganda of dangerous diseases and to “cleanse” Buganda’s armies when they returned from military expeditions. The border regions were also protected by the national gods. In northern Bulemeezi county near Buganda’s northeastern frontier with Bunyoro and Busoga stood the shrine of lubaale Kawumpuli, the god of the plague (Frontispiece). This temple contained an underground chamber in which the god remained trapped, thereby restricting the plague to this virtually unpopulated region. The temple of the war god Kibuuka (Frontispiece) was located at Mbale in Mawokota county in the western part of the kingdom, which formerly belonged to Bunyoro. According to legend, Kibuuka was a powerful Ganda warrior who was killed by the Banyoro at this site, and after his death he became a god. Kibuuka’s priests advised the king about warfare on Buganda’s western and northern frontiers and supervised the ritual procedures associated it. The temple of the second war god, Nnende (Frontispiece), was located in the eastern part of the country at Bukerere in Kyaggwe county, next to Busoga. Nnende’s priests protected this frontier, which in the late nineteenth century was regarded as Buganda’s private “back door” ( mmanyu ), through which large quantities of plundered slaves, cattle, and plantains were regularly brought into the country (Nsimbe 1950: 208). The greater part of the southern boundary of the kingdom was formed by the offshore Ssese Islands of Lake Victoria, called Nnaalubaale, or “Mother of the Gods.” Mukasa was the chief god of the lake, and his main temple was located on Bubembe Island (Frontispiece). His priests governed all the traffic across the lake and controlled Buganda’s large fleet of war canoes. Strategically placed and heavily subsidized by annual tribute from the king, the temples of Buganda’s important national gods—Kawumpuli, Kibuuka, Nnende, and Mukasa—played an important role in maintaining the political and ritual integrity of the kingdom.',\n",

If the heir fails in these duties, the spirit will punish him; but the spirit itself does not remain in continuous contact with those it has left behind. Its active intervention is practically confined to visitations in which it expresses anger at some injury. This is done by “possessing” one of its descendants. The spirit is supposed to enter the stomach by the mouth and cause a type of indigestion known as kigalanga, whose first symptom is said to be a very cold feeling.

The Kogi almost never use medicinal plants and regard them as “belonging” to the Colombians. “To cure sickness, the Mother gave us stones,” they say, and only in rare cases, when dealing with minor ailments, are infusions of herbs used.

One would expect that an astronomer would take the opportunity to discuss all of the naked-eye planets, visible or not. The letter is not clear as to whether or not the Star of Disease was observed or whether it was definitely associated with Saturn. We have already seen some of the implications of this object, if it is Saturn, in our analysis of planetary conjunctions that may relate to Morning Star ceremonies.

       "  'That nothing good could be expected from the dead we have already seen from the stone powders and the stone beads that are strewn on the graves or buried there in order to avoid sickness. When the sun went down from the middle ( 15, 6), the dead person came to the huts in order to devour the survivors, that is, to make them sick, and that is why he is buried on the first afternoon after his death; thus, if he died in the afternoon, he would be buried immediately. This was the time of the dead, when they were active and also could most easily be driven away. That is also why cohabitation with the widow occurred during this first night. Hiséi keihi (to make free, or to remove, the dead) was also the name of the last act of the burial ceremony, the strewing of the black stone powder seikuitsi over the grave (cf. Ch. V: “Stone Magic”). The deceased is put in a crouching position with the knees drawn up; the hands are put, palms together, against the left cheek; and he is wrapped in a woman’s garment, since this was formerly also the garb of the men. In this position he is put in a hammock, which is hung on a pole, and carried to the grave-yard in the vicinity of the village. The relatives follow, in part weeping, but not shrieking. The round grave is approximately one and a half meters deep. The deceased in placed in this with his face toward the south, toward the snow-capped mountain Takindúe -- as I was told -- to which the soul goes. The hammock is taken back again. Even today sêveral things are still given to the deceased in the grave, but now there is no longer any rule governing this. Priest Miguel says that his father Narciso gave his golden festival adornment to a friend to keep during a trip, but the latter’s son later said that he had put the things in the grave with his father, who had died in the meantime, which was believed and respected. The place of the grave can also still be distinguished later. Merely the 131 later strewing of stone powder and planting of stone beads calls for that. But for the uninitiated no distinguishing marks are present. Some said that one laid a stone slab on it. And in fact in the cemetery of Noavaka, as my boy Telesforo Gutierrez reported to me, there were two of the characteristic stone installations which one also finds elsewhere in the land of the Kágaba, especially in the neighborhood of the temples. and which to the uninformed look like stone seats, since they consist of a thin slab of stone lying on the ground and another set upright against it like the back of a chair. Moreover three and two of these respectively stand in a row in front of the door of the two temples in Nabuvakai (Ill. 36), one behind the temple of the Kasikiál, others near the temple in Noavaka. They are called hakuktú (stone slab), also haksinkana, perhaps from sinika (striped, striped stone), and were also in these cases explained as seats of the priests. On the other hand, the row of stones close to Takina on the north consisted of similar stone-installations, which were explained as field crops (of. p. 105). Still others about ten minutes above and below Takina on the way to Makotama and San Miguel were explained as helpers ( háñguakukui ) of the temple of Takina, which are supposed to inform the priest of the arrival of sicknesses and other dangers. There were none in the region of Palomino, only one stone installation in the valley of the Rio Kavikongui not far from Santa Rosa, and seven more below Noavaka, in addition to those already listed from there previously.

They are caused by magical performances of the medicine men, who for this use these birds or bats as transmitters, in whose bodies they send their own souls.

Chang immediately recovered and, to thank the god, contributed a large sum of money to build him the temple known as the Chi-an Kung or Ta Tao Kung Miao. There is also the possibility that T'an-ti's location near the wharf over which all imports and exports had to pass gave Pao Sheng Ta Ti the advantage of a location conducive to widespread renown. Still another possibility is that Pao Sheng Ta Ti served to “mediate” ethnic contradictions that gave rise to many conflicts and much distrust.

       "  'Saar in Somali describes a state of possession by a spirit also called saar . The extreme symptoms are frenzy, fits, or madness, and the spirit itself is, in the Islamic setting, described as a kind of jinn whose malignant powers cause certain types of sickness. Among the eastern tribes of northern Somaliland ‘invisible’ wadaad (see above) act similarly to saar but have less serious effects and are merely responsible for some minor forms of illness. Saar can be expelled by persons who have acquired mastery over the spirits through having themselves been previously possessed. In northern Somaliland such ‘doctors’ ( alaqa ) are generally women, for visitation is here confined almost exclusively to this sex, especially to the wealthy. Rich women who believe that a saar is troubling them have recourse to an alaqa: poor women cannot afford to be afflicted by saar because treatment is costly. Such an illogical situation leads sceptical Somalis to abandon their belief in saar . This is not the place nor is there at present sufficient material on the social contexts in which saar are active, to enter into a sociological discussion of the subject. It seems possible, however, that we are concerned with a form of the witchcraft which is associated with wealth and polygamy elsewhere and which serves as a vehicle for jealousy and as a buttress of social status. Saar are expelled in the ‘dance of the saar ’ which is apparently fairly extensively practised in Somalia although violently opposed by Muslim wadaad . In northern Somaliland, where official opposition is such that many devout Muslims deny its existence, 1 In fact in 1955 the British Somaliland Protectorate Advisory Council unanimously agreed that legislation should be introduced to make the practice of saar rites illegal. War Somali Sidihi, No. 60, 23 April 1955. the dance is sometimes still performed by women. It seems that the dance acts as a form of exorcism of the malevolent jinn causing possession, and perhaps less frequently as a means of attaining possession. In Somalia, the opening movement is called or-goys and consists of those assembled beginning to sing and to raise their arms rhythmically towards the sky. Soon someone falls in a faint and his companions ‘beat the saar ’, forming a circle round him and breaking into ‘the song of the saar ’, sung at first slowly and then with increasing tempo. Drumming, castanet-playing, and handclapping swell the singing. Slowly the fallen dancer revives, and moving his limbs in rhythm, seizes a knife or lighted brand which he thrusts between his teeth and dances into the semi-circle formed by the others. The tempo increases until the dancer again succumbs and falls panting to the ground. After a little he rises completely restored and the saar is said to have left him. 2 Among the Cushitic Agao of Gondar in northern Ethiopia, the refractions of the Sky God ( Zar ) which possess people are called zar, are associated especially but not exclusively with women, are inherited in the family, and have genealogies corresponding to their territorial distribution (Leiris, 1934 (1), 134, 126). The dance is widely distributed among the Cushitic peoples of north-east Africa and often the possessed dancer acts as an oracle 3 The After (Danakil) of southern Eritrea and of Ethiopia have a similar ceremony in which the possessed dancer is called jenile (jinn?) . See Licata, 1885, 267; Thesiger, 1935, 8. (see Leiris, 1934). Beyond the Cushitic areas, it occurs as far away as Egypt (Kahle, 1912), the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (Trimingham, 1949, pp. 174-7), and even the Hijaz (Hurgronje, 1888-9, II, pp. 124-8). The explanation seems to be that the saar (Zar) dance has spread far beyond the bounds of Cushitic culture with the export of slaves from Ethiopia where it has its Cushitic origin (Cerulli, 1933, II, p. 35).',\n",

Johnston, in commenting upon this, says ( The Uganda Protectorats, p. 803): ‘It may be this explanation has been invented recently to explain a very ancient custom inherited by the Masai from the Nilotic stock, which was their origin; for amongst these people the removal of the lower incisor teeth is a very common practice.’ Hinde's explanation, however, appears to be very widely spread. .

Illnesses believed to be curable by girka are extremely varied and range from impotence, infertility, insanity, and paralysis to rashes and boils. Each specific illness or set of symptoms is symbolically linked to the actions of a specific spirit. No less important to an understanding of girka but perhaps less directly stated in the actions of participants, the ritual identifies the recruitment of a new cult-adept. This is symbolized by the definition of a successful cure as one which results in the attainment of harmony or reconciliation between the sufferer and the iskoki diagnosed to have caused his illness. The continued obligation of the former sufferer to obey the commands of the spirits on his head is expressed in the description of him as a ‘horse of the gods’ as well as in the denial that a cured person has been exorcized of the afflicting spirits. In other words, girka is a two-sided coin: with cure written on one side and initiation on the other.',\n",

If an Andaman Islander be asked why he paints himself with white clay, or why he wears a belt or necklace of Dentalium shell he replies that he does so in order to look well; but if he be asked why he wears a string of human bones round his head or neck or waist, he gives quite a different answer, to the effect that he does so in order to protect himself from dangers of a special kind. According to circumstances he will say either that he is wearing the bones to cure himself of illness, or else that he wears them as a protection against spirits. Thus while some things are worn on the body in order to improve the personal appearance, and consequently, as explained above, to give the individual a sense of his own value, others are worn because they are believed to have a protective power, and thereby arouse in the person a sense of security. Exactly the some sort of protective power is attributed to things that cannot be worn on the body, such as fire, and it will therefore be convenient to consider together all the things that afford this kind of protection, whether they can be worn on the body or not.',\n",

Each king or princess chief is buried in a huge grave encircled by a fence with the pointed stakes and the lashings of royalty. Trees are planted round it, an outstanding feature in the treeless Plain. The “sleeping chief” is believed still to rule the neighbourhood and its people. He or she may cause good or ill fortune to befall the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, “who are known to it,” but his power is not limited by distance, since any royal grave can afflict any member of the royal line anywhere, cause misfortune to the whole of Loziland, or trouble any Lozi, even in White country, if it knows of him and his ancestors, especially if he is a member of the political sector attached to the royal grave. Each grave has its resident priests, appointed by the king in council. The priests make national offerings at the king's orders, and the cult is under his control. Individuals make offerings through the priests and if a spirit has been particularly troublesome the king himself may make offerings to it, through the mediation of the priests. According to Holub 4 Holub, 1881. and Louis Jalla. 5 Jalla, Louis, 1928. royal ancestors are regarded as intermediaries between Nyambe and the living. The relation between the Nyambe cult and the cult of the royal ancestors is by no means clear. The royal ancestors are sometimes entreated to intercede with Nyambe to restore someone to health and sometimes they are themselves regarded as the cause of disease. There is one priest of Nyambe who is first given a portion of all tribute; and in national extremity he makes offerings to Nyambe . 6 Gluckman, 5, 1943, p. 93.\",\n",

From experience with certain basic sets of symptoms, illnesses are distinguished as being either in the realm of the physiological or supernatural, and therefore requiring a cure within that particular realm. Thanks to the villagers' new awareness of the germ theory of disease, most illnesses are immediately classified as physiological and, therefore, within the domain of science and medicine -- primarily modern, Western-style medicine rather than Chinese herbal medicine. Such illnesses as measles, rashes and skin diseases, trachoma, colds, stomach disorders supposedly resulting from bad food or water, and the like, all fall clearly into this category. To treat these illnesses, it is now customary for the villagers either to call in a Western-style practitioner or to choose their own drugs or patent medicines.\",\n",

They are bitterly opposed to each other’s influence, and they clash for the most part on the battleground of sickness and disease. An exhaustive treatise on the Santal attitude to disease has been published, and shows conclusively that, as with ghosts so with sickness, the ideas of the Santals are common to all the lower strata of society in North India. 1 P. O. Bodding, Studies in Santal Medicine and Connected Folklore, Memoirs of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal, Vol. X. These ideas are not simple but complex, and range from the realm of the rational to the fantastic. Disease is sometimes ascribed to natural causes, particularly when the chain of causation is fairly obvious and can be repeated in a series of experiments; there is a whole class of food described as batol, which means that it is unwholesome. There are hundreds of remedies that require no supernatural aid to make them effective. Some remedies are the property of all, while others are the property of individuals and the knowledge of their ingredients is a closely guarded secret. Chaitan of Churimara began his career as a physician in response to a specific need. When he was a young man a friend had come to him in great distress and said that his boy was vomiting blood. He turned to Chaitan and asked him if he knew of any medicine that would be good for the boy. Chaitan was so sorry for his friend that he promised to do something, although when he said this he had no notion what he should do. As he was setting out for his friend’s house he prayed to Cando and asked that he might be shown what he ought to do; at the same time he shut his eyes and kicked at the soil. As he opened his eyes again he saw a plant, which he immediately dug up. He ground the roots to make a medicine, and the boy recovered from his sickness. Since then he has applied the same remedy to many other cases. One of his patients had been extremely ill, he said, but was now the father of four or five children! He has been in great demand as a physician, and claims that Cando subsequently revealed many remedies to him. Sometimes it is claimed that remedies are made known in dreams. The plant that was first revealed to Chaitan was the upel tandi plant, which has a red flower.',\n",

Strangely enough, these people, otherwise so brave, intrepid, and even ruthless with themselves, appear as though broken, wholly cast down, and completely despondent when a serious illness or a bad accident strikes them. I am inclined to trace this phenomenon back to their character, which completely and without resistance adapts to every situation of life. (68) This resignation, however, may not, as Gallardo:293 suspects, “atribuirlo al hecho de saber el paciente que será abandonado si se agrava /be ascribed to the fact of the patient's knowing that he would be abandoned if he became worse/”; it was not customary among the Selk'nam to leave a sick person to his fate so that he thereby perished (p. 681). That is, the Indian silently locks his teeth on brief, penetrating pain, hot stinging wounds, a sharp blow, and bears it all with cold-blooded resignation. A person who cannot rise from his sickbed is surrounded by the sympathy of all, even though they cannot help. But with sincere love he is offered everything that pleases him or that is desired by him; in fact, many a sick person has been gravely harmed by excessive tenderness and inappropriate help. (69) Absolutely without justification Gallardo: 293 limits to the slightly ill ones the anxious, readily helpful co-operation of those around them; of course, in reality all are “cuidados con cariño por sus parientes, cariño que en muchas ocasiones les causa la muerte, como sucede en los casos en que convendría la dieta y que por el contrario les dan todo lo que piden /cared for with affection by their relatives, affection that on many occasions caused their death, as happened in the cases in which diet was important and, on the contrary, they gave them all that they asked for/.”\",\n",

But “the eater should remain aware of the fact that ‘The-one-up-there’ sees what every person down here is doing!” 512 cont. It is difficult to determine which, in the interpretation of the Indians, should be more strongly emphasized: The giving of a small portion of the food, say, in the manner of a first-fruits offering, or the thought of the omnipresence of the Supreme Being.

An epileptic may sleep in the kitchen, which is usually a separate hut away from the main house.

Children with epilepsy will not be allowed to play with others and the parents of the others will warn their own children to keep away and not to play together with them. The result of these beliefs is that when an epileptic has a fit everyone runs away. If he should fall in the fire or into water it is quite likely that no one will pull him out and he will be left to burn or drown. A few informants said that they recognised that epilepsy was not infectious and others said that the isolation they were subjected to was not only due to its supposed infectious nature, but because of the unpleasant and rather frightening nature of the fits themselves. Epileptics also tend to be dirty although in many cases this is due to their isolation and lack of the usual socialising influences.

Because married women have more rights than unmarried women, there is more likely to be understandable grounds for indignation on the part of a deceased wife. One of the most common sources of trouble is the failure of a second wife to respect the rights of her predecessor. In addition to the right to a place on her husband's altar, a married woman also has the right to expect her replacement to treat her “like an older sister.” The second wife should pay a formal visit to the first wife's home immediately after her marriage and thereafter observe all of the duties of a daughter with respect to her predecessor's parents. She should also prepare special foods for the first wife on her deathday and say, “I hope older sister will protect me and help take care of the children.” One of my most reliable informants told me that his father's sister had died shortly after marriage and that her husband's second wife had not visited their family. “Her children were sick all the time until she did this, but then everything was all right.

Hence it behoved the living, and especially the relations upon whom the care and welfare of the ghosts depended, to be ever watchful for their interests; otherwise the ghosts would retaliate and cause illness and death in the clan. A favourite place of the ghosts was among the trees and plantains in the gardens, where they made sport, especially at noon when the sun shone brightly; on this account children were warned against going out to play in the gardens during the heat of the day, and even adults did not enter them at this time, unless they were obliged to do so. When the wind blew softly and murmured in the leaves of the trees, the ghosts were said to be talking to one another, and when a whirlwind occurred and carried up the dust and the leaves the ghosts were said to be at play. Ghosts hung about the graves in which their bodies lay buried; nothing would induce them to go far away from the spot except the removal of the body or of some particular portion of it. The special portion of the body to which a ghost clung was the lower jawbone (lwanga); when once this was taken away the ghost would follow it to the ends of the earth, and would be quite satisfied to remain with the jawbone if it were honoured. This supposed knowledge of the way to control a ghost has been acted upon for many years; there are jawbones of men, who lived nearly a thousand years ago, preserved to this day by members of the clan to which they belonged; and they are regarded as a most precious heirloom.

On this account, whenever the King sent to rob or plunder people, they would escape to the nearest of these hills, and wait there until the King withdrew his party; both they and their goods would be safe as soon as they reached the sacred hill. At Gaga on the Boa hill there was a temple in charge of a priestess Kalambika, and also a female medium Bakima . No King was permitted to visit Boa, but all were compelled to stop short at the foot of the hill. It is related that King Mawanda wished to build his capital on the hill, but, after crossing the stream, he suddenly became blind, and remained so during his stay there, though, when he left the hill, he immediately recovered his sight. From that time onwards the hill has been regarded as sacred. On the hill there was a sacred forest, into which no one except the priest was permitted to enter. A broad path ran round the hill, and was kept in good repair by the chief of the district. If the chief allowed it to become overgrown with grass and weeds, and a grass fire caught any of the trees or the grass in the forest, the medium (it was said) would fall ill with burning sores. The chief would, under such circumstances, be fined for neglecting the road and allowing the fire to enter the forest. When a new chief was appointed to the district, he visited the grave of Matumpagwa (who is said to have been the first important chief in the district). On arriving at the grave, the chief spread a barkcloth over it, and mourned for the dead chief for several days; thereupon he killed a goat, and caused its blood to run into a drum, which was covered with the goat’s skin and beaten. The chief gave to his principal wife two cows in token of his promotion to the chief’s office; he also visited a number of places believed to be the abodes of ghosts, and propitiated them; at Muruli he offered a hoe to the ghost. At Mpumude he was given a woman to wife, and from there he returned to Boa, where he sat on a certain stone, while his wives were brought and introduced to him as though he did not know them. He was then given a pipe by the priestess Kalambika, which he smoked; afterwards he made a tour through the district, passing the grave of Matumpagwe .',\n",

       "  'The soul is called umé, which also means “breath” and “breeze.” 2 Koch-Grünberg (1915-16) also noted uméde (pulse) and uménde (heart). I believe that the connotation of the term is revealed by the verb umédani, which means “to get up,” “to rise.” As a spirit entity the soul is referred to as umémakü (or umémako ). The soul leaves the body during dreams, returning as the dreamer awakes. The Bahúkiwa, at least those with whom I discussed the subject, did not believe that the umé might fail to return and so cause death. Death and illness result, they insisted, from something entering the body. At death, the umé leaves the body permanently, journeying after a suitable interval to a nearby river, dwelling of the spirits. After death the umé has human form. It can be heard talking and can be seen by the shaman. The spirits of people who have been adulterers, uncooperative, breakers of the bonds of ritual friendship, or in any other way markedly unsocial assume an animal form. “Since they did not care for people,” the Cubeo say, “they cannot live among the souls of people after death.” Those who have committed incest or have eaten a forbidden fish called namúri have souls after death in the form of the bauvéko, a bird that is feared greatly.',\n",

It was said that men know charms to make rain to fall, the sun to shine, and to stop adverse winds, and that such knowledge is usually transmitted in certain families, men teaching their sons or their sisters' children. A charm for stopping rain is to chew ginger which is then expectorated in a fine spray, a formula which ends in a high-pitched sibilant -- s -- s being muttered the while. The same process with different words is used when it is desired to make the wind abate, and I believe that this process with appropriate words is used to propitiate or avert any possibly dangerous influence, as for instance that which a stranger may reasonably be expected to exert.

       "  'The manang looks upon a sick person as being possessed with an evil spirit, and as long as this evil spirit remains in possession the patient cannot regain his health, he conjures it to depart; if it be obstinate and will not go he summons his own familiar spirit, and requests it to show him in what way the tormentor may be prevailed upon to take its departure. He acts upon its suggestions and propitiates it with sacrifices; but if it still prove obstinate and refuse to budge, the manang admits his inability to deal with it, and some other wizard is called in who is believed to have at his command a more powerful familiar. Whether the patient live or die the manang is rewarded for his pains; he makes sure of that before he undertakes the case, for he is put to considerable inconvenience, being fetched away from his own home and obliged to take up his abode with his patient; he can therefore undertake only one case at a time, but to it he devotes his whole attention. He takes his meals with the family, and in other ways makes himself quite at home. If a cure be effected he receives a valuable present in addition to his ordinary expenses. Herbal remedies are frequently administered by him, and a diet enjoined. Such treatment works wonders in all simple disorders, and not unnaturally, but to enhance the value of the cure, spells are muttered and cabalistic verses recited exorcising the foul fiend that is tormenting the body. I have known manangs to have administered in this way European medicines procured from the Government dispensary, for they are wide awake and ready at all times to avail themselves of remedies of known efficacy. Every regular manang is supposed to be attended by a familiar spirit who is good and powerful; but it often happens that the evil spirit is the more powerful of the two, and when this is the case the sick man cannot recover, and death ensues. By death they understand the flight, of the soul out of the body. When a person complains of pain in the body the familiar will often suggest that some mischievous devil has put something into him to cause the pain. The manang will thereupon manipulate the part and pretend by some sleight of hand to draw something out of it, a stick, or a stone, or whatever it may chance to be, which, no doubt, he has previously concealed about his person, and he will hand it about and exhibit it as the cause of the pain in the body, which he has thus been able to remove without so much as leaving a mark on the skin.',\n",

He had many children, seven, I believe, and one white bull on which his children rode when visiting neighbors, itimni. It happened that someone stole his bull and thus made it impossible for him to move about with his children. The children began to get sick and cry from hunger, and drove the old man to such a point that he dug a pit, put the children in it, and lit a fire over them. When the children began to choke and die he struck his tambourine and, walking around the fire, began to perform a shamanistic rite and utter his grieviances against mankind. In return for the injury he had suffered Ulu-toen gave him the right to take away a child for every hair on the bull. Since this time the old man, turned into an er , has gone about crippling and killing children. Not a single shaman could overcome him, but now he has received the full quota of children alloted to him and has become harmless, as a result of his old age and infirmity. When he now visits someone he is not given what he asks for, but simply taken by the neck and thrown out. (Namsk Ulus, 1887). It is characteristic of the Yakut shamanistic pantheon that for the most part the secondary spirits are former shamans or people who had somehow been injured, or in general suffered, while on this earth. To their titles is always added the clan name, which again indicates the tie between the Yakut cult of shamanism and their clan organization and their clan history. 2 In the Zapadno Kangalas Ulus I was even shown a tiny circular island in the middle of a small lake, on which the yurt of Dampay-Braday had once supposedly stood; this was not in the Bologur Nasleg, but in the Oktemsk Nasleg.',\n",

       "  \"Most of the Onges, in their native surroundings, remain very dirty. Under the conditions, the hygiene is almost unknown to them. In most of the cases, washing and cleaning are not done. The bodies of men and women remain almost perpetually covered with clay, mixed with pig or turtle's fat. They just do not bother to clean it and rather keep on giving new layers when the old ones get removed. Because of such a procedure, their bodies keep on emitting unpleasant odour. In this respect, what Cipriani wrote continues to hold true. Accordingly, the more a wife loves her husband the more magnificent designs she executes on him. The paintings on their bodies reach a peak every two or three days, as the Onges feel illness and death if they are not newly daubed, and the face, at least, must be continually painted with at least smear on the chest, arms and legs. Painting of clay on the body is done for various purposes such as for curing of diseases, to decorate on various occasions, to show affection to the husband, in mourning, in menses and for killing pigs. The practice also gives way to various kinds of skin diseases. The diseases of skin are comparatively more common among the Onges. They keep on scratching their hands, feet and the down portion of the abdomen having slightly elevated rashes. Among skin diseases, ring worm is quite common. Apart from skin, the internal diseases, among the Onges are not uncommon. The weather conditions, unhygienic food and other environmental conditions have their own role in causing such diseases. The raw material for food is not properly cleaned. It is boiled in dirty water containing mud and dust. The utensil in which the food is cooked is hardly cleaned. It is used over and over again without being cleaned. Layers of dirt keep on accumulating on the utensils used for cooking and eating purposes. The dogs also eat the left-overs in the same containers. In an Onge camp, slightly beyond Butler Bay, I for the first time saw the pork being cooked by the Onges. When I reached the camp, I found no Onge attending to the cooking. They were relaxing in their Korales. About two yards from one of the corner huts, I observed an eighteen litre tin-container (without any cover), all black from outside with the accumulation of soot, kept on three small stones having fire underneath. The tin-container was almost full of pork pieces and water. Nothing else was added to it. As the fast wind was blowing, there was enough of sand, dust and tree leaves lying on the water surface inside the tin. All these were being boiled with the pork. No Onge was coming to remove them or to cover the tin with something. Sometimes the dogs would come and peep into the tin. When talked to the Onges, it was responded that this is their usual way of cooking. Soon after the pork is boiled, it would be distributed to all the members and consumed as it is. Thus, the pork along with other unwanted material, goes inside the stomachs of the Onges. Such practices ultimately cause stomach upset, dysentry and other related troubles. The large communal huts of the Onges are dark from inside and quite congested. The cooking is also done inside the hut, either near the respective beds or in the middle of the huts. Lots of bones and skulls are found hanging inside the hut. There is too much of smoke inside and soot layers are often seen in the ceiling of the hut. The conditions in the hut are not healthy.\",\n",

       "  'We shall now see how these annual ceremonies of the dances of the masks are performed. Once the day for the beginning of the ceremony has been determined by divination, the whole town is cleaned, and the road which leads from it to the nearby stream or river, where those attending will take their ritual baths, is repaired. Then the Máma lights a fire in the ceremonial house by means of a drill, afterwards feeding the flames with certain woods which have been brought exclusively for this purpose. 142 In the meantime the fire is extinguished in all of the houses and is then lighted again with embers which each man brings from the ceremonial house to his dwelling. In the afternoon the Máma and his assistants, as well as the men of status who will take an active part in the dance, leave the town and go to a nearby house, to the one belonging to the Máma or to one belonging to some Elder, where the masks and other ritual objects have been deposited beforehand. There they put on the costumes, ornaments, and masks, and at nightfall they come back to the town. Some men play large gourd trumpets announcing the arrival of the masks, but otherwise the participants proceed silently in single file. Upon arriving in the town, they then pass through its plaza and all enter the ceremonial house, walking first toward the east, then toward the west, south, and north, respectively, all with short steps, the knees bent, and making bows toward the “four corners of the world.” Meanwhile only the trumpets are played. This entrance of the masks is interpreted as a ceremonial greeting. Halting in the middle of the house, the masks pronounce the ritual greetings and commence a song accompanied by a slow dance, during which the dancers scarcely move from their places, but only rock the body from side to side or abruptly move the head from side to side. In the accompanying song the masks say that they were sent by the Universal Mother to visit the Kogi and to see if “all is in accord.” They ask if there are food and firewood, if all have confessed and fasted, and if the town has been cleaned. After a short time the participants remove the masks and place them on large tripods of stakes, which have been placed along the walls in the interior of the ceremonial house for this purpose. Then the gathering sits down on little benches and hammocks, and periods of conversation, singing and dancing performed by individuals and more of the nature of practicing, follow. Occasionally the Máma intervenes and directs the dancing, inviting all of the men to participate in it. They go on dancing this way through the night, sometimes with the masks, sometimes without them. Now maracas, trumpets, drums, and flutes accompany the songs, and the dancers stop facing in this direction, perhaps just turning their faces and maracas to this side. Thus “the masks speak with the directions” and “keep the bad at a distance and bring the good.” At the same time the Máma receives from the 143 men, dancers or observers, the bundles of mineral dust, opens them, and blows their contents toward the four directions. Many times the men themselves do this and the Máma does not personally intervene. According to the time of year or the special object of the ceremony, they next repeat certain dances and songs, say, the dance of Kandjí, the dance of Namsíku, the dance of the rain, or the many dances which are performed in order to “be in accord” with the animals which damage the crops. In the festivals of the solstices and equinoxes, the next day is devoted to the dance of the mask of Surlí or the one of Nuikukúi (the Master of the East). At dawn the tripods with the masks are placed outside the ceremonial house with the faces turned toward the east “to greet the sun.” In the afternoon, or sometimes even in the morning, the mask of Surlí dances outside or inside the ceremonial house, his dance being accompanied by songs and the sound of the trumpets. At night the masks are brought in again, and the dances and songs continue until dawn, together with the offerings of mineral powder. In the free hours, however, the men devote themselves to small household tasks, eat from time to time, or toast coca leaves in the ceremonial house. No matter what the immediate object of the ceremony may be, whether “to turn the sun around” or “to arrange a rain-shower” (that is to say, to make it rain), the prime concern is always to keep sicknesses away. In the songs they speak of “making fences on the roads of sickness” or of “closing the doors to sickness,” and on occasion the dancers manipulate a small broom of leaves in each hand for the purpose of “sweeping away sickness” and “cleaning the pueblo.”',\n",

       "  'A hunting accident that happened to the headman of a Bará longhouse on the Macucú River illustrates some of these concepts. What follows is a much abbreviated version of an account given me. About twenty years ago, José of Anüyuhtí longhouse went to hunt white-lipped peccaries. He shot one, which was especially fierce because its mate was about to give birth. The peccary gored José in the knee, but he killed it with his dogs. He limped back to the longhouse, carrying the dead peccary. The wound got very bad. Old Arturo, the most knowledgeable of Bará shamans, started a curing chant, but José was ready to die. His feet were already cold and only his heart moved. Old Arturo went to Ewüra wi, a longhouse near Ewüra taró. 19 S. Hugh-Jones (personal communication) states that the Makuna and Taiwano eat snakes. He saw José already there, standing outside the door. He was putting on black body paint, festive ornaments, and feathers. His mother and his father were there, and many people awaited him. José had almost finished painting himself and was about to enter the longhouse. If he had entered, he would have died in this world. The people at Anüyuhtí were already crying. Old Arturo came and pushed José away from the doorway. Many peccaries were outside the house waiting, and Old Arturo began to scare them with his power. First he summoned a big wind. The peccaries said that wind had been around since the beginning of the world. Then Old Arturo summoned a tremendous fire, which did scare them. They lined up and began to enter the longhouse. He made them shut all the doors, which he closed with big logs. Old Arturo took away their aüawüri (long flutes), taking away their dances, taking away their hearts. When Old Arturo returned to this world, he carried these flutes in his throat, and José recovered. But this is why there are no peccaries in these parts today.',\n",
       "  \"The eldest of the Brethren, Tafito, the Atua i Fangarere, known commonly as the Atua Lasi, the Great God, symbolised both prosperity and disaster. In a variety of unusual ways he was associated with the head . His vegetal symbol, his ‘head’, was the breadfruit, known as mei , but also as te uru fenua , the ‘head of the land’, an indication of its prime place among Tikopia foods ( Primitive Polynesian Economy , 1939, p. 65 ). On the other hand, sprung untimely from the head of his mother, he was cursed as the future bearer of epidemic disease. He was also disaster in another According to Pa Nukutungasau, of Vaisakiri in Fangarere, the rau of the Atua Lasi for the ocean, passed on from his chiefly ancestor Faisangakitetai, who was the founder of the lineage, was Rakaitengaru. This title, ‘Hasten in the Waves’, was a secret one, corresponding to the more well-known one of Tiporokou. Both were ‘evil titles’ ( rau pariki ), his man-eating titles. Under this title the god operated under all the skies known to the Tikopia; he destroyed canoes and ships and crews. From his position in the ocean he would see a vessel above, then rise and stand on the deck, and press it down beneath the waves, after which he would devour the men. The hull did not drift on, as is the usual case with a canoe overwhelmed at sea, but sank down to the bottom. Another method he used to destroy vessels was to part the ocean--‘to separate the path of the vessel’--so that it fell down in a watery cleft and the waves closed over it; he could then eat the crew at leisure. The total loss of craft at sea, with nothing ever heard of them again, was due to him. ‘We think that the canoe has been attacked and destroyed in a foreign land, but no; not slain in another land’ (cf. Work of the Gods , p. 301). So in this transformation the god represents the principle of mysterious disaster at sea, though without any particular ‘head’ referent. But the association between ‘head’ and ‘disaster’, seen already in the bursting out from his mother's head, is carried a step further in a variant of the tale of the killing of Tangaroa (see later.) According to Pae Sao, Tangaroa was not the real victim of the attacker Resa; it was the Atua Lasi, and Tangaroa was the result, the pieces of the shattered head . Tangaroa was ‘the chips of the head of the Atua Lasi’. And a title of the Atua Lasi in Taumako was Te Urupaku, the Dry Head. 1 Paku with short final vowel (ordinarily as pakupaku ) means ‘dry’; paku with stressed long final vowel means to thud with noise, to resound. The latter meaning would seem to fit the attack by Resa, but I think the former was the pronunciation in the name Te Urupaku. Here without much difficulty one can construct a pattern of Lévi-Straussian style: Tafito = original or base bursts through uru = head but without destroying it, and becomes himself uru = head, while incurring further power of bearing destruction; he is himself later destroyed by having his own head burst open, which in turn gives rise to another being; but in one context he is named by a ‘head’ title. Clearly some sense of continuity of theme and of opposed qualities is at work here, though as far as I can see from the data the pattern stops there.\",\n",

       "  \"These plantings are, on my interpretation, three aspects of the same symbolic event, actualized by the manang on the morning following the pelian , when he plants the cordyline palm lily, used throughout the ritual, outside the longhouse. Each ‘planting’ forges a beneficial link between the human and celestial realms. The manang is depicted as replicating the past actions of now celestial manang for the benefit of his patient in the terrestrial world; in so doing, he creates a direct link between the unborn child and the benevolent supernatural beings ( petara ); and, simultaneously, he establishes a visible material counterpart of the child's vital principle ( semengat ). Furthermore, he forges these connections at the same time as he erects an ‘unseen spiritual fence’ around the mother and unborn child to thwart malign activity on the part of any less benevolent spirits in the immediate environment. The cordyline remains, after the ritual performance, as a condensed symbol: a representation of the unborn child's vitality and longevity and a channel of power bearing all the authority of the manang tradition. This polysemic character also adheres to the rite itself: described, even named, as a ‘fencing’ and ‘enclosing’, it is simultaneously and just as clearly, a ‘bridging’ and ‘embedding’. This chant, indeed this whole ritual, is an excellent example of the Iban use of botanic metaphors and symbols to represent aspects of the person. Not only do the celestial manang assist in the series of plantings, which culminate in establishing the unborn child's cordyline of longevity, but they are themselves depicted in the pervasive botanic idiom. 13 Sather has described ‘plant symbolism’ as ‘a fundamental element of Iban thought’ (1978b:98). He points out that: Many plants are attributed sacred properties, or function as ritual objects, and floral imagery, symbolizing spiritual powers and relationships, or demarcating realms of gods and spirits, permeates every facet of Iban ritual life (cf. Harrisson and Sandin 1966:56-62). Like men and animals, plants are regarded as a major kind of living thing, sharing the same fundamental properties of life ( idup ) and death ( mati or parai ). In this connection, plants are the basic symbol of life itself to the Iban. The fecundity and flourishing, generative growth of plants is, at an individual level, the prime symbol of human fertility and healthful vigour. Similarly the vulnerability of plants, and their eventual death, provide the basic analogy for impaired human health and mortality ...

       "  \"This already protracted account of Aymara folk-medicine would still be incomplete without mention of a variety of native chiropractic called t'alantaña or c'uimaq'aq'oña . The theory of this Aymara science is that various internal organs, particularly the heart ( c'uimia ), may become physically dislocated kiucxata . By massaging the arms and the torso carefully, and by binding with a wide textile girdle, the visceral dislocations of the patient are reduced, and he is cured. In the t'alanta procedure previously mentioned the patient is also sometimes tossed gently in a poncho held by serveral people, until his organs return to their proper position. The processes of truq'aq'a and p'ic'aq'a involve rubbing certain substances upon the body of the sick person, but with a different motive: to absorb the evil spirit which has entered, so that it may be tempted away by libations and sacrifices. A similar practice is lumaq'a , or “purification.” Some diseases like tertian fever can be cured by frightening the patient severely, for then the evil spirit will abandon his body. One of the fevers, which has the appearance of a skeleton-thin woman with disheveled hair, can be so cured. Tuberculosis, however, which is caused by tall, thin, frozen beings who live by drinking the blood of their victims, is not cured in this way. Typhoid fever can be sidetracked by cutting open a black chicken and placing it on the stomach of the sick person, or by placing his legs in the stomach of a dead dog, or by putting black guineapigs on his body immediately after eviscerating them. The disease of culpa-usu , which is caused by the “penetration” of a bone from the tomb into the body of the victim, can of course only be cured by the removal of the foreign body itself.\",\n",

Sudden sharp pains ( palâs , ńuoll a = “arrow”) are treated by the Kolt-Lapps by having another person pinch the painful spot -- he takes the pain in his own finger-tips, as it were, then blows it away. 1 HÄMÄLÄINEN, Koltta-Lappia, p. 87: The healer spits on his finger-tips, then pinches the sore place as if gradually pulling out the pain.

The tamily of a sick person consults the local curers, who pulse the patient. The witch “has left his signature in the blood” of the patient, and by pulsing him the curer can “hear and feel” who the witch is. His procedure is to ask the patient to tell what troubles he has had with his neighbors and relatives, and as the patient recites the names of the people with whom he has had conflict, the pulse jumps. As in the use of the lie detector, this indicates where there is high affect: in Teklum it is interpreted as positive indicator of the guilty person, the witch. If the curer gets drunk enough, he may reveal the name of the witch, but he usually prefers not to--I know of at least three cases, one of which is reported here, in which the man who announced the name of the witch was killed by the person he accused. The family may then check the consultation with curers in neighboring towns or even in the departmental capital Since these distant curers are not inhibited by fear of the witch, they name the guilty one. The family, or the patient, may broadcast their suspicions, even announcing the consultation over the loudspeakers in the local liquor shops.

       "  \"In ordinary cases the patient lies down on the ground while the medicine man bends over, rubs and sucks vigorously at the affected part of the body, spitting out every now and then supposed pieces of wood, bone or stone, the presence of which is believed to be causing the injury and pain. This suction is one of the most characteristic features of native medical treatment, as pain in any part of the body is always supposed to be due to the presence of some foreign body, which must be removed. Amongst especially the Western Arunta the medicine man, in addition to the Atnongara stones, is supposed to have a particular kind of lizard distributed through his body, which endows him with great suctorial power, such as the natives attribute to the lizard itself. In serious cases the action is more dramatic, and the medicine man needs a clear space in which to perform. The patient, perhaps too ill to sit up, is supported by some individual, while the medicine man who has been called in, and may have come a long distance, gravely examines him and consults with other practirioners who may be present, and with the more immediate relatives of the patient, as to the nature of the illness. The diagnosis may occupy some time, during which everyone maintains a very solemn appearance, all conversation being carried on in whispers. As a result the medicine man will perhaps pronounce that the sick man is suffering from a charmed bone inserted by a magic individual, such as a Kurdaitcha; or perhaps, worse still, the verdict is that one of the Iruntarinia has placed in his body an Ullinka or short barbed stick attached to an invisible string, the pulling of which by the malicious spirit causes great pain (Fig. 119 nos. 10, 11). If the latter be the case it requires the greatest skill of a renowned medicine man to effect a cure. While the patient is supported in a half-sitting attitude, the medicine man will first of all stand close by, gazing down upon him in the most intent way. Then suddenly he will go some yards off, and looking fiercely at him, bends slightly forwards and repeatedly jerks his arm outwards at full length, with the hand outstretched, the object being thereby to project some of the Atnongara stones into the patient's body, the object of this being to counteract the evil influence at work within the latter. Going rapidly and with a characteristic high knee action from one end of the cleared space to the other, he repeats the movement with dramatic action. Finally, he comes close again, and, after much mysterious searching, finds and cuts the string, which is invisible to everyone except himself. There is not a doubt amongst the onlookers as to his having really done this. Then once more the projecting of the Ainongara stones takes place, and crouching down over the sick man he places his mouth upon the afiected part and sucks, until at last the Ullinka is extracted, either in fragments or, very rarely, and only if he be a very distinguished medicine man, whole, and is shown to the wondering onlookers, the Atnongara stones returning, unseen, once more into his own body. When this is over, unless it is simply a case of senile decay-on the part of the patient, in which case the medicine man is too acute to take so much trouble, when he knows pretty well that there is no possibility of effecting a cure, the chances are strongly in favour of the latter, but if death ensues FIG. 120.--POSITION ASSUMED WHEN USING THE UNGAKURA POINTING APPARATUS. ARUNTA TRIBE. FIG. 121.--POSITION ASSUMED WHEN POINTING THE IRNA.

The fact that Quintin's health improved in the hospital did not lead him to doubt his compadre's verdict that supernatural forces had brought about his illness.

Furthermore, before festivals every individual in the whole village had to confess, upon which protection from sickness followed as one of the acts of the festival. The following assertion in a song ( 56, 6) refers to this: “Then the Colombians came. . . and the four-day and the nine-day dances and confessions ( alunezguaka ) disappeared.” This is to say that confession was part of the ceremony, but the numbers refer to each individual one.

The account of Pulang Gana provides the basis in myth. Sacrificial offerings are invariably made at all times in which the Iban stake a claim to the use of land, whether for a short or long term purpose. Success of the undertaking implies that the arrangement has been satisfactory to all parties. When, however, events occur which are undesirable--bad harvests, sickness or death--it is assumed that something has proved un-acceptable to the spirits who then express their dissatisfaction by the calamities which they have the influence to inflict. A calamity is something which in the perfect and natural order of events does not occur: serious or chronic sickness, a wound which refuses to heal, or death in early or middle age (death in old age when there are children and grandchildren to uphold the bilek' s existence is considered natural). The behaviour of the spirits is essentially the same, when they effect calamities of this nature, as that which is expected among men when one man has infringed the rights of another, territorially or otherwise. In such circumstances there are two conceivable courses of remedial action. In milder cases it may be possible to satisfy the spirits with further offerings and sacrifices, but when the consequences are really serious or continue to recur, the only solution is to abandon the farm, longhouse, or project which has disturbed the menoa rights or interests of another party.\",\n",

John Hunt was staying with me at the time and we went together to the dwelling of the woman, he armed with a large dose of Epsom salts, and I with a bottle of spirits of hartshorn. On our arrival we found the house filled with people, and the woman on her back in the midst, shouting lustily, ‘Let me alone, that I may return!’ The excitement was very great, but the shouting was considerably checked by the sudden application of hartshorn to her nose. When a light was brought we discovered that our patient was by no means a Venus, which led Mr. Hunt to observe, with dry gravity, ‘Truly she is a beauty: what a fancy the god must have who can desire her!’ A burst of laughter from the spectators, in which the husband outlaughed the whole, followed this remark. The treatment was most successful. The woman's pride was so strong that she at once sat up, assuring us that the god had gone away, and that she needed no more medicine.” 59 Thomas Williams and J.

       "  'Both these statements are incorrect. They were, perhaps, based on a misinterpretation. The Kabaka led the nation in supporting the gods and supplied them lavishly with gifts of tribute, but he did not control them or their cult, as some kings painfully learned. The Kabaka’s obligatory gifts to the gods indicate a relation of asymmetrical exchange (cf. Kenny 1988: 604). Upon accession, the Kabaka rebuilt the lubaale temples and presented the gods with large endowments of women, slaves, cattle, goats, and cowrie shells in multiples of the sacred number nine. The gods, in turn, exhorted the new king to “always love the gods” and gave him their blessing (Kaggwa [1907] 1934: 21). Every year, the Kabaka made new presentations to the gods to secure those blessings. He also gave a large number of human victims to the war god Kibuuka whenever Kibuuka’s temple was rebuilt. While responsible for the upkeep of the country’s major shrines, the Kabakas never oversaw the worship of the lubaale or governed the priests. On the contrary, when the Kabakas refused to take priestly advice and proceeded to kill the priests and loot their temples, the chronicles say that the lubaale were quick to take revenge. They set illnesses and other afflictions upon the Kabakas in order to put them in their place. In the nineteenth century, the priests of Mukasa regarded Mutesa I as their “son-in-law” (Roscoe 1911: 298), even their “slave” (Ashe 1895: 102n.), a relationship that indicated his subordinate status. The chronicles also report that Mukasa’s priests generally succeeded in forcing Mutesa I to do their will. To be sure, Mutesa’s father, Ssuuna II, is said to have boasted that he was the lubaale on earth because he could with impunity plunder the temples of the lubaale of the sky (Roscoe and Kaggwa 1906: 50; Burton [1860] 1961 II: 191). But even the powerful Ssuuna was unable to force the gods to do his bidding. The dynastic accounts say that Ssuuna was struck by lightning sent by lubaale Kiwanuka because he mistreated one of Kiwanuka’s priests (Kaggwa [1901] 1971: 119). Ssuuna is also said to have died of smallpox because he disobeyed the warnings of the priest of the war god Nnende (Nsimbi 1956b: 134). When Mutesa was ill in 1879, the priest of Mukasa attributed the malady to Mutesa’s political ambition, which offended Mukasa. Mutesa was thus forced to return the powerful chieftainship of the Mugema to its rightful possessors, the Vervet Monkey clan (Rowe 1967: 154-56; Kaggwa [1901] 1971: 176). As Roscoe himself noted, the temple priesthoods were appointed by the clan heads ( Bataka ), and although it was necessary for the king to ratify priestly appointments, the priesthoods tended to support clan interests (Wright 1971: 4). Even though the king might summon the priest of the war god Kibuuka to the capital, the god could refuse to let him go and the priest would stay at home (Kaggwa [1907] 1934: 222). Kaggwa also notes that Kibuuka was treated like a Kabaka, and his seat was called Nnamulondo, which was the name of the king’s enthronement stool. It was pointed out to me that ever since Tebandeke, the eighteenth Kabaka, who became a priest of Mukasa while on the throne, there was an institutional incompatibility between the Kabakaship and the priests, and the two could never be combined (cf. Kaggwa [1901] 1971: 56-59).',\n",

       "  'Although theory and practice were oriented to descriptive psychiatry in the prewar stage, emphasizing biological predisposition and viewing mental illness as a manifestation of “defect” and “sickness,” after the postwar turnover of the medical system in general, the system of modern psychiatry in Taiwan became a dynamically-oriented one. The nature of emotional illness is now seen as a reaction to stress or a maladjustment to the environment, and an attempt is made to understand the mechanism of illness through a dynamic and sociopsychological approach. In spite of this, there is some difficulty in absorbing and digesting some psychoanalytic theories, because it is not clear whether they should be rejected or modified to meet this very different sociocultural setting. In practice, the availability of somatic treatments such as shock therapy and the newly-developed psychopharmacological therapy certainly facilitates the progress of psychiatric care, particularly for the major disorders (psychoses). A large proportion of psychotic patients now can be improved in short period, and long-term custodial care can be avoided.',\n",

In such a primitive society as that of the Andamans one of the most powerful means of maintaining the cohesion of the society and of enforcing that conformity to custom and tradition without which social life is impossible, is the recognition by the individual that for his security and well-being he depends entirely upon the society. Now for the Andaman Islander the society is not sufficiently concrete and particular to act as the object of such a sentiment, and he therefore feels his dependence upon the society not directly but in a number of indirect ways.

They do not know of the existence of pathogenic germs or of the chemical-biological action of the organism and the poisons that act upon it.

As the obvious forces of nature exist, they admit that there are, moreover, occult forces capable of producing the most varied and strange phenomena. Nor can the meteorological and astronomical phenomena fail to impress them. The Indian, besides, is a convinced animist, as we shall see later.

       "  \"Aguardiente is illness-producing either directly because of its substance, or symbolically because it is one of the media by means of which a witch causes his victim to ingest poisonous substances. In turn, the drinking of aguardiente is interpreted as a disease process to the extent that individuals take “medicine” to reduce the number of occasions upon which they drink. The text citations which have been inserted above are suggestive of these points. By way of summing up this section, I would like to offer a less easily verifiable interpretation which provides still further context in terms of which the reader can think about the drinking performances in Aguacatenango. The first simple set of observations is as follows: Men drink and women don't. Some men drink more than others but all men must drink some. Some men would prefer to drink less than they do. Drinking settings for some men, especially under the informal drinking rules, are settings in which some considerable hostility is expressed. Suppose we take the case of the man who wishes to drink less. He can achieve this end in the short run by either drinking more or not drinking at all. He knows that he will not be able to completely terminate his drinking performances (the ceremonial drinking performances) until he is an old man. Ceremonial drinking performances are required of all men. He can, however, reduce the number of informal drinking performances. If a man wants to reduce the number of informal drinking performances, then, he can do so by increasing the average length of any particular informal drinking performance. Increasing the length of an informal drinking performance increases the probability that the individual will become ill (as well as exhaust all his resources, anger the members of his household, and so on). Upon the next occasion when some individual invites him to start an informal drinking performance, he can respond by saying, “I am afraid to start an informal drinking performance with you since my style of informal drinking performance results for me in severe illness, alienates my family, causes economic catastrophe to my household.” The person inviting must allow that this is true, in view of the fact that he observed ego engaging in such extended performances within the past year, say. On the other hand, an individual can stop engaging in informal drinking performances by reporting that he has taken medicine for drinking, which medicine will cause his death if he drinks. It is not unusual for a man to take medicine and then become very sick by way of telling the community that it was real medicine with strong disease producing effects. If a man goes on drinking in the informal drinking after he has taken the medicine, it is proof that the medicine did not have the desired effect. The common feature of either response to the desire to reduce amount of drinking: increasing the length of the informal drinking performances or taking medicine puts the individual in that context which allows him to say, “If I drink I will die.” We believe that it is only by citing such severe effects as this that an individual can, over the long run, control his response to the invitation to drink. 1 In the short run, a man can avoid any particular, highly probable informal drinking performance by leaving the field, as was suggested above. That is, by knowing which days informal drinking performances are more likely to occur on than other days (the ten day time zone around some major fiesta, or Sundays, for example), he can arrange to be “away on business.”\",\n",

He was killed just as he was entering his house.” Although Ong Hok-hin was generally thought of as a man of good character, the manner of his death was taken as evidence of some unsuspected crime. “He always seemed to be a good man, but he must have done something very bad that no one knew about or the gods wouldn't have punished him that way.” A more sophisticated informant made the same point about a relative who had been killed by a truck, adding that “this is the reason people say it is better to die of an illness than to die a violent death.”\",\n",

The doctor accepted the invitation, but he also proposed that before he could go to Buganda with Kinyolo, they would first of all make a blood brotherhood. 10 So as to protect himself against betrayal. As soon as it was made they left for Buganda and on their arrival, the doctor gave the king a fetish and declared: “Kakungulu will never invade Buganda again because I have cast a spell against him.” After giving this fetish to the king, Kigulu the doctor asked for leave to return to his own country. But before he left, the king told Kinyolo: “You must drown him in the lake, lest Kakungulu hears of him and consults him also.” At first Kinyolo refused to kill his “blood brother”, but the king threatened him that, should he refuse, he must never return to Buganda. Because of these threats, Kinyolo agreed to drown the doctor and when they reached the river Kagera, he was thrown in and got drowned. On his return, Kinyolo gave an account of his mission to the king and went to his home in Kisugu. But as soon as he arrived, the ghost of his lame blood brother attacked him and made him very ill with the result that his legs swelled and he died soon after. Then the diviners warned the king never to send a war expedition against Buzongola. But when the Bazongola murdered the royal salesman, Semakookiro was so enraged that he ignored the diviners’ ban and sent a punitive expedition to Buzongola. On the return of the campaign, the king’s legs began to swell like those of Kinyolo. He suffered so much that all sorts of doctors were brought, but none of them cured the disease.',\n",

It is a standing belief that a witch can cause trago to accept poisonous material which will kill the man who drinks it.

The yin world is the usual residence for ghosts, who, however, are all too often able to find an entrance into the yang world. When they do so, they are liable to bring sickness, discord or even death to those who encounter them. Sometimes people act foolishly and make it easy for ghosts to cause trouble.

At other times, people quite inadvertently run into ghosts, with consequences equally as bad.

Bleeding and scarification are common practices of purely magical significance among all Indians of South America, and as far as the Pilcomayo tribes are concerned I shall have occasion to mention this custom again in a later chapter. The very scars left after such operations are regarded as a protection against evil spirits. Further, that tattooing is done by means of ashes or soot is certainly not an accident. The use of ashes for superstitious purposes is of frequent occurrence among the Indians, the general idea being that ashes are a prophylactic against evil spirits. The custom of mixing ashes or soot with saliva is significant from the same point of view, for magical virtues are commonly ascribed to the saliva.',\n",
       "  \"The ghosts we examined were those of deceased, unwed girls seeking husbands. Let us now pursue this same theme with some other kinds of ghosts. The first example came to public attention when a child was stricken gravely ill. His family first took him to medical doctors and complained of having spent over 3000 Kuay ($ 75) to no avail. They also used a ki o-á and a tâng-ki to consult at various times with King Guo, Marshal Shieh, and the Third Prince. These three gods all agreed on a supernatural explanation of the child's illness. The boy's father was in Japan at the time of the illness, but it was he who was held responsible for the problem. The father's father (the boy's grandfather) had died before the boy's grandmother, and this lady had married again into another family. She had apparently lived happily with her new husband and eventually died in the bosom of her second family. Some time after the old lady's death, the sick boy's father built a new house and equipped it handsomely. He decided it was rather awkward not to have his mother's ancestral table beside his father's on the new family altar, however, so he negotiated with the old lady's second family and ultimately received permission to take the table home to worship at least temporarily.\",\n",

The operation serves as a test of the bravery of the future warrior; it is followed by a period of seclusion. The excision of girls may take place a few days after birth or at about the age of two or three or about the age of seven. It is done by women. One fact is to be noted here, for it is characteristic: excision is followed by what has inaccurately been called “stitching.” After the clitoris has been cut off, the two sides of the organ are made raw and joined with actual hooks made of thorns. Only a very small opening is left. Gum is spread upon the wound to facilitate the healing process, and the flesh soon grows together. It is established that the women are not “stitched,” but rather “welded.” This operation, which is extremely painful, is followed at the time of marriage by a reopening which is no less painful. Without hesitation, one may regard this quite simply as an attempt to guarantee virginity in the most extreme manner possible and with complete disregard for the consequences of such precautions (fatal accidents, absence of normal muscular reactions at childbirth which force the midwife to enlarge the opening with a dagger, etc.).',\n",

       "  'Another rite de passage of critical importance takes place on the occasion of a woman’s first childbirth. After the Muslim naming ceremony on the seventh day, the mother returns to her parents’ home with her baby, and remains there for a period of six months or longer, during which she performs the prescribed post-natal ablutions daily for five months. This custom, known as bangwalle, has many different variations, but its performance for the first birth is normative. On completion of bangwalle the mother returns to her husband’s compound loaded with gifts from her kin, and for the first time in her husband’s home will suckle her infant without any pressure or compulsion being necessary. But throughout their lives, a parent of either sex and the first-born child observe a rigorous avoidance-relation, which is hardly relaxed even in private and when the child is fully grown. As the very full acount in the text illustrates (pp. 1 sqq.), social sanctions compel conformity to this behaviour, both during the period of ablutions and thereafter. The entire complex is best understood as a rite de passage, marking the transition in status to parenthood and full social maturity, and the lifelong avoidance-relation, which is extended by Fulani to the second and third child, and by Hausa-speaking Habe and Fulani to the next-born in greater or less degree, if the first child dies in infancy, gives a permanent expression to this new status. Similarly the post-natal ablutions, which are carried out for successive births, are probably best understood as extensions of ritual activity on the first childbirth rather than as measures of preventive hygiene (which the Hausa declare them to be), since such ablutions are not performed for stillbirths or miscarriages, and may be brought to an early conclusion if the mother is unable to bear the washing with nearly boiling water; if this happens, alternative ‘medicines’, herbal and Islamic, are employed.',\n",
       "  'It is impossible for the Christian races to understand, or estimate the powerful influence, which the “medicine” beliefs have for ages exerted upon the Indian character and tribal life. It being their universal belief that illness of the body signified possession by an evil spirit, their methods of healing, in common with those of all savage tribes, naturally took the form of incantation and occult ceremonies for exorcising it. No doubt the title of “medicine,” by which their doctors were known in our early chronicles of the Indians, had its origin in this manner with the early French colonists. By a natural transition it passed into that of “medicine men,” with English speaking people. A “medicine man” is believed to control the weather, to heal the sick and exorcise evil spirits by means of incantations and magic arts. He is really more of a magician than a medical doctor, although he constantly assumes the functions of the latter. His vocation is to instruct and guide in the avoidance of acts that are “bad medicine” and therefore unlucky, and in the use of the best means for propitiating the Evil Power, because of unlucky acts already committed. When an Indian is “making medicine,” he is performing mysterious ceremonies, or using other approved means for controlling the supernatural powers and averting the malevolence of the evil spirits. Some authorities have understood the word as meaning “mystery,” and the medicine man as “mystery man.” But this is not an adequate expression. While there is no corresponding word in the English language to express the equivalent of the Indian idea, the phrase “supernatural power” is probably the nearest equivalent to the word “medicine,” in its common Indian use.',\n",

In Hsin-chu itself, this event is regarded as a pho-to (exorcism) and focuses on the grave containing the bones of those Hakka slain in their efforts to support imperial troops against the forces of the rebel Lin Shuang-wen in 1786-88 (Michael Moser, personal communication). For example, when I asked why a raw pig and raw fowl were offered to Co Su Kong, who is known to be a vegetarian, I was often told that Co Su Kong accepts the raw meat, cooks it, and distributes it to the hungry ghosts.

All are called nuvakala, because there is dancing with the feather adornment of the birds ( nuva ), or kuiza (dance), while the church festivals are called pita, pitei, from the Spanish pitar (to pipe), or suziuan, from suzú (the stranger). The 110 March festival is to get from the sun protection against sickness for the coming rainy season and in addition a brief continuation of the dry season in order to finish the field work. It is therefore concerned exclusively with health, whereas that occurs only incidentally in connection with the two other festivals ( 40, 62, 77 ). In the September festival there is expressed the endeavor to call forth rain or to lessen its abundance, to moderate the winds, to keep all kinds of animals away from the crops, and in every way to care for the thriving of the crops. The December festival is concerned with the restoration of the dry season, with the harvest itself, and with all the tasks of the dry season, such as housebuilding and the making of pots. Common to all the festivals, besides the above-mentioned concern for health, are: at the beginning, songs for the birds whose feathers are worn at festivals ( 49 to 51 ); occasional songs for the animals who make up the festive foods ( 52 to 55, 63 ); at the end, songs for the eating of salt ( 29, 30, 64, 65 ), and after that the women’s dances, which are almost exclusively directed against animals that pursue the chickens ( 1 .

They believe that the spirit part of the child goes back at once to the particular spot from whence it came, and can be born again at some subsequent time even of the same woman. Twins, which are of extremely rare occurrence, are usually killed immediately as something which is unnatural; but there is no ill-treatment of the mother, who is not thought any the less of. We cannot find out what, exactly, lies at the root of this dislike of twins in the case of the Arunta and other tribes. Possibly it is to be explained on the simple ground that the parent feels a not altogether unrighteous anger that two spirit individuals should think of entering the body of the woman at one and the same time, when they know well that the mother could not possibly rear them both, added to which the advent of twins is a very infrequent event, and the native always has a dread of anything which appears strange and out of the common. In connection with this it may be noted that on the very rare occasions on which the child is born at a very premature stage as the result of an accident, nothing will persuade them that it is an undeveloped human being; they are perfectly convinced that it is the young of some other animal, such as a kangaroo, which has by mistake got inside the woman. 1 Sterility is of frequent occurrence at the present day amongst the native women. The greatest fertility is amongst the strong stout women, the thin and weaker ones rarely having children. Possibly sterility in many cases is associated with injury received during the initiation rite of Ariltakuma. The natives believe that it may be brought about by a girl in her youth playfully or thoughtlessly tying on a man's hair waist-band. The latter so used, if only for a moment or two, has the effect of cramping her internal organs and making them incapable of the necessary expansion, and this is the most frequent explanation of sterility given by the natives.\",\n",

The culprit mother and her child would then be cleansed with the smoke of deer or fish fat, placed first into a ladle filled with hot coals, and carried three times under the mother's arm-pits. In order to avoid sterility women were not allowed to sit in the sleigh used for the transportation of the objects of the shaman religious cult. Sterility caused because of the violation of this prohibition was also cured through purification with smoke.\",\n",
       "  \"The offerings made to the gods also express obeisance, but the motives are entirely different. A person worships his ancestors because he is obligated to do so as an heir or descendant; he worships the gods in the hope of gaining their sympathy and good will. Since a man is no more obligated to worship a god than he is to make gifts to an official, there is no thought that a god might punish a person for neglecting him. But neglect of worship is the most common reason given for misfortunes attributed to the agency of the ancestors. A man who used to live in Hsia-ch'i-chou married and moved out of the village, leaving his sister and her husband to care for his parents’ tablets. A few years later his wife fell ill, and then one of his children. Frightened by these events and a doctor's inability to cure the illnesses, he consulted a shaman and was told that they were caused by his father, who wanted his son to care for his tablet. The shaman explained the essential difference between the gods and the ancestors in these terms: “A man is free to believe in the gods or not believe in the gods, but he has to believe in the ancestors. If he doesn't, they will come back and cause him trouble.”\",\n",

The translation that I give here -- according to what at the time seemed clear to me from the explanation of my informant -- of ‘ argau as ‘pancreas’ and barmad as ‘duodenum’ is not certain. ). These parts of the livestock are illicit. The bladder is the one in which there is urine and from which the beasts urinate. The bile too is illicit. The bile is that ugly thing which is in the liver and is like water. The ‘ argau (pancreas) is under the sternum. The heart, on the contrary, is eaten. There is one who was born for the heart and eats it. There is one who was born for the liver and eats it. There is one who was born for the kidneys and eats them. The one who was born to govern eats the liver. One who is not able to spit against the scorpion eats the kidneys. One who is not able to spit against the sickness called sebbad eats the heart. It is our medicine. ‘Heart is for me!’ says the one who spits against the sebbad sickness and will not eat heart. Our Molkal people is thus. Our women do not eat the heart either. What thing is the scorpion? It is an animal that bites you while you walk on the ground. If that animal bites you, that man who does not eat the kidneys spits on you. And the discomfort (of the scorpion’s bite) leaves you. For another the liver is illicit. What thing is the sebbad? It is a sickness that on some comes out of the cheek, and on others out of the sides and is fatal. It is a sore that does not heal. It comes out and then pus comes out. When this pus flows, if it is spat upon, the wound heals. If one who knows how to spit on this sore is not found, it is rubbed with the menstrual blood of a woman. And that one recovers.

The shaman then has to extract the object, which he does by the aid of his familiar spirits. To prove his success he displays to his audiences pieces of bone, or worms, or similar things that he has secreted on his person before-hand. The laxatives that we occasionally administered answered the same purpose. Both sickness and ill-luck can be embodied in physical objects and carried away. Haviuyak had a boil on his arm which he pricked with a needle as soon as it came to a head, squeezing the pus on to a piece of caribou meat. He asked me to let him give it to Scotty, the biggest dog in my team, who would carry the contagion away with him when I left. One of his own dogs snatched at the meat, but he kicked it away and anxiously watched till the whole morsel had disappeared down Scotty's throat. To propitiate the dog he tied a band of white deerskin round its neck. Some days later he was asked how the boil was progressing, and answered, ‘It has all disappeared, thanks to the dog.’ Another Eskimo, Kaiyoranna, made me a present of two bone pins fastened to the outside of a small deerskin bag. I wanted to look inside the bag, but he checked me and tried to draw my attention to the fine workmanship in the pins. Later, after I had left the camp, I found only four old scraps of skin in the bag. I showed it to some of the natives, and they explained that Kaiyoranna had fastened some one's illness or ill-luck in the bag, and added the pins as a bribe to induce me to take it away.”\",\n",

In traditional Tikopia belief, most illnesses, especially the graver ones, were the work of spirits. Now the view had changed radically. ‘Formerly when the land became ill, it was greatly because of spirits. Now it is not so, because the land has become different. Sickness is from the vessels that come from the sea, just as in the Solomons. Is this correct, friend?’ The inference from this assumption was of course that since illness was now the product of external influences, not of spirits, it was remedies of an external order, not of a traditional spiritual order, that were required.

In Bao-an and the surrounding area spirit marriage occurs differently. The ghost seldom appears in a dream to her parents to demand a husband. In the cases with which I am familiar she strikes misfortune upon her natal family or the families of her married sisters. This usually takes the form of sickness of one or more family members. When the sickness is not cured by ordinary means, the family turns to divination and learns of the plight of the ghost through a séance. Usually several sessions are held with different gods before a marriage is finally agreed to by the living. The most common oracle to which problems of spirit marriage are put is the female medium of a so-called Little God 6 The term “little god” is used to refer to the divinized spirits of local people, whose oracles are consulted primarily by women for information on the rearing of children and other of the family's affairs that are entirely or largely under the government of women.

In its place he casts “a vessel full of illnesses,” especially fevers, and soon the surroundings become infested with mosquitoes; the inhabitants of the maloca fall ill or are forced to leave their dwellings. The natural explanation of this phenomenon that, according to talk, is frequent enough is this: sometimes the fish that live in the large pools of the rapids, near the landings, migrate and abandon a certain sector of the river. As soon as this happens, the place becomes almost uninhabitable due to the great quantity of mosquitoes whose increase is caused by the absence of the fish that previously fed on the larvae of these insects. However, as these places are also natural camp sites, many mosquitoes become contaminated with malaria causing these sites to be very unhealthy. 3 . Near Piramirí (now Teresita) on the Papurí River there is a stretch of rocky ground called Vaí-mahsë toré .

       "  \"There are two interpretations of the healthy appearance of Maasai. The popular view is to note the excellence of their diet and way of life by normal African standards (Orr and Gilks 1931). The more sombre view is to accept that only the most robust children have a chance of survival and natural selection is a major factor in the level of health (Merker 1904:334). The true balance between these is hard to assess. The Matapato are reluctant to discuss family tragedies and they dispose of dead children unobtrusively. The general absence of congenital disabilities inevitably raises questions regarding the fate of defective babies. 3 The term en-tomononi refers most commonly to a young mother whose hair reveals her ritual state, but it also applies to certain other ritualised roles including the infant itself. Apart from emphasising the weakness of her condition, informants offered no derivation of this term. In the related language Bari, however, a phonetically similar term, tomunyan , is translated as ’tenderness, feebleness, weakness’ (Spagnolo 1960:300). In its male form, ol-tomononi may refer to a generally propitious elder with children, who is especially suitable for a prominent role in any ceremony. It is held that any deformity could indicate some past sin dogging either parent, but God condoned this birth and God alone should choose the moment of death. As children are progressively exposed to the outside world, those that are maladapted are less likely to survive, but still a few may do so and even live to raise healthy families of their own.

Restatement of his conviction of the rightness of his decision emerged in final spirit statements that they agreed to depart from him and come to him no more.

The onset and disappearance of a wave of common colds which followed the visit of the ship when I was set down on the island was a perfect illustration of the spread of an infection.

It seems that a good part of the tensions which at present characterize the marital situation is due to such considerations. Frequently, under present conditions, an individual marries any woman, regardless of her Dáke, and generally both parties are ignorant of the details of the Túxe system, knowing only that they belong to a certain totem. Although the Máma sometimes disapproves of such a marriage, he allows it; and thus frequently an individual marries a woman who, according to the ancient rules, is not suitable for him. If then any misfortune occurs in the family, such as illness, bad crops, or infant mortality, the Máma is the first to blame the husband and to tell him 191 that the misfortune occurred because he married a prohibited woman. When the man thus realizes that his “food” was not suitable for him and that, as a jaguar, he had “eaten” a snake, he thus immediately rationalizes the illness, infant mortality, or the loss of fertility of his cultivated lands in terms of a dangerous indigestion which threw his marriage completely out of balance and exposed it to very severe supernatural punishments. Let it be said that, in all the complex functioning of the Túxe and Dáke, the totemic idea is the one that has been most strongly maintained among the Kógi, and in any marriage both parties know very well to what totems they belong, although they may know nothing else about additional rules, origins, or attributes.',\n",

       "  '“.... -- The people of northeastern Siberia use compressed ‘brick tea’ almost exclusively, and drink it very strong and black, when their supply is sufficient. They have no milk, and practically no sugar; nor do they add tallow or rye-meal, as do the people of southern Siberia. 200 Roasted rye-meal is sometimes used in the north as a substitute for tea, but it is not much liked by the people. They drink tea in large quantities three or four times daily, sometimes as much as forty large cups a day; but it does not seem to affect their nervous system. This is due to the fact that compressed tea, being prepared of the refuse leaves mixed with sheep or ox blood, contains but small quantities of the alkaloid. Europeans travelling in that country generally consume nearly as much tea without ill effects. Tea is considered by the people as a substitute for food. Its chief importance, however, is that it presents an excellent means of restoring heat after travelling or walking out of doors in the cold. It is considered to be healthy; and the natives believe that in the summer-time, when camping on the damp tundra, plenty of hot strong tea keeps off cold and fever. For all these reasons, scarcity of tea is considered almost everywhere as nothing short of a calamity, which, however, befalls the people almost every year for several weeks, whenever the arrival of the merchant caravans is retarded by blizzards or by swollen rivers.”',\n",
       "  '“The devil is death”; “After death we are all devils”; “Sicknesses are the dead.” These three phrases of the Kogi show very clearly what the concept of Heiséi, Death, means to them. Of course, the word “devil” does not exist in their language, but heiséi -- dead person or death -- is always translated in this way, since it is the force opposed to the principle of the good, of life. Heiséi ( 3 . The etymology of the word is unknown to us. Preuss writes: hiséi . ) is spoken of as a collectivity, just as sometimes “the Mother” and “the Mothers” are confused; and this concept includes all the dead, that is to say, all of the ancestors of the tribe who are not expressly designated as immortals such as the Fathers, Mothers, or Masters. Heiséi is a man, and they imagine him with “the face of a tigre.” In fact, the mask which represents him has a long muzzle and great projecting teeth, and during the dance which is performed with it the movements and growls of this wild animal are imitated. Heiséi is the Master of Sickness and it is he who sends it to earth to punish those persons who have committed offenses or who have been negligent about the rites and offerings. Just like the Mother, Heiséi is omnipresent, but his symbols are male symbols: the snake, the arrow, the crab ( 4 . The crab is a “worm.” The big blue crabs of the coast are called heiséi husso -- crab of death. ). The mast of Heiséi shows a snake coiled around the face. The color of Death is blue, and the sky is blue because “the dead live there” ( 5 . It is not always very clear where the dead live, in the sky or in the snow. Cf. “Religion, The Beyond.” ). Archeological sites are places where “Death lives” ( 6 . Cf. “Economy, the System of Horticulture” /see 1: Reichel-Dolmatoff in this file/. Ancient osseous remains are called heiséinita . ), and archeological objects are “things of the dead,” and therefore full of contagion and sickness. Such objects must be reburied or handed over to the Máma . Heiséi has a marked sexual character ( 7 . Perhaps the name heiséi is related to sé sei -- penis. ) and controls the sexual life, especially of the men. 91 In fact, he is sometimes designated as Father of Homosexuality. The Kogi believe that there is almost no place on the surface of the earth where there has not been cohabitation some time, that is to say, where human beings who today are heiséi have not cohabited. The earth is imagined to be literally impregnated with the sperm of the dead, and contact between this and the sperm of the living “opens a door” through which sickness may enter the land. If a person performs the sexual act again in one place, Heiséi “will do harm” to the sexuality of the man, will send sicknesses to him, and will cause the death of the children. These sites are designated as “traps” (katú) into which the sperm falls; and above all graveyards or places where it is believed that dead persons are buried are called this ( 8 . Compare with this concept of “trap” the uterine symbolism which burial has. Cf. “Life Cycle; Death and Burial.” ). Since the land itself is a female element and symbolizes the Mother, coitus on this land always implies the danger of incest, and Heiséi is closely related to the incestuous instinct. The ritual of coitus is considered essentially a means of defense to counteract the malign influence of Heiséi and to avoid this incest.',\n",

A great deal of Yaanomamo sorcery and mythological references to harmful magic focuses on children as the target of malevolence. Yanomamö shamans are constantly sending evil spirits ( Hekura ) to enemy villages. There, they secretly attack and devour the vulnerable portion of the childrens' souls ( noreshi ), bringing about sickness and death These same shamans spend an equal amount of time warding off the dangerous spirits sent by their enemies. Children are vulnerable because their souls are not firmly established within their physical beings, and can wander out of the body almost at will. The most common way for a child's soul to escape is to leave by way of the mouth when the child cries. Thus, mothers are quick to hush a bawling baby in order to prevent its soul from escaping. The child's soul can be recovered by sweeping the ground in the vicinity where it most probably escaped, calling for it while sweeping the area with a particular kind of branch. I once helped gather up the soul of a sick child in this fashion, luring it back into the sick baby. One of the contributions I made, in addition to helping with the calling and sweeping, was a dose of medicine for the child's diarrhea. A consequence of this set of attitudes about the vulnerability of children is that much of the village's activity with respect to shamanism and curing is directed toward the children.\",\n",
       "  'Disappointed at the non-appearance of the caribou, my versatile “father” sought by other means to replenish our dwindling stock of meat. He visited the harbour, where I had noticed some bearded seals playing in the open water near shore. It was not difficult to shoot them, but to bring them to land was an extremely hazardous enterprise, since a thin sheet of ice covered the water for a distance of a hundred yards out from the shore. Any dead seals that remained afloat, buoyed up by thick layers of blubber, drifted gently against its outer edge. Ikpuck crawled cautiously toward them, testing the ice in front of him with his hunting-knife; then, attaching a long line to a carcass, he retreated a few yards and dragged it out of the water. This was the most perilous task of all, and more than once the ice creaked ominously under the strain; but salt-water ice is less brittle than freshwater, and he escaped with nothing worse than two badly frozen wrists. Out of six seals that flated he landed three, which provided enough blubber to last us a month, even if we kept the lamp burning five or six hours a day. He did not mention the freezing of his wrists, and we did not discover their condition until they turned completely black.',\n",

       "  'After half an hour’s visit I was led by the Hajj through the streets of Zayla ** Zayla, called Audal or Auzal by the Somal, is a town about the size of Suez, built for 3000 or 4000 inhabitants, and containing a dozen large whitewashed stone houses, and upwards of 200 Arish or thatched huts, each surrounded by a fence of wattle and matting. The situation is a low and level spit of sand, which high tides make almost an island. There is no harbour: a vessel of 250 tons cannot approach within a mile of the landing-place; the open roadstead is exposed to the terrible north wind, and when gales blow from the west and south, it is almost unapproachable. Every ebb leaves a sandy flat, extending half a mile seaward from the town; the reefy anchorage is difficult of entrance after sunset, and the coralline bottom renders wading painful. The shape of this once celebrated town is a tolerably regular parallelogram, of which the long sides run from east to west. The walls, without guns or embrasures, are built, like the houses, of coralline rubble and mud, in places dilapidated. There are five gates. The Bab el Sahil and the Bab el Jadd (a new postern) open upon the sea from the northern wall. At the Ashurbara, in the southern part of the enceinte, the Bedouins encamp, and above it the governor holds his Durbar. The Bab Abd el Kadir derives its name from a saint buried outside and eastward of the city, and the Bab el Saghir is pierced in the western wall. The public edifices are six mosques, including the Jami, or cathedral, for Friday prayer: these buildings have queer little crenelles on whitewashed walls, and a kind of elevated summer-house to represent the minaret. Near one of them are remains of a circular Turkish Munar, manifestly of modern construction. There is no Mahkamah or Kazi’s court: that dignitary transacts business at his own house, and the Festival prayers are recited near the Saint’s Tomb outside the eastern gate. The northeast angle of the town is occupied by a large graveyard with the usual deleterious consequences. The climate of Zayla is cooler than that of Aden, and, the site being open all around, it is not so unhealthy. Much spare room is enclosed by the town walls: evaporation and Nature’s scavengers act succedanea for sewerage. Zayla commands the adjacent harbour of Tajurrah, and is by position the northern port of Aussa (the ancient capital of Adel), of Harar, and of southern Abyssinia: the feuds of the rulers have, however, transferred the main trade to Berberah. It sends caravans northwards to the Dankali, and south-west-wards, through the Eesa and Gudabirsi tribes as far as Efat and Gurague. It is visited by Cafilas from Abyssinia, and the different races of Bedouins, extending from the hills to the seaboard. The exports are valuable—slaves, ivory, hides, honey, antelope horns, clarified butter, and gums: the coast abounds in sponge, coral, and small pearls, which Arab divers collect in the fair season. In the harbour I found about twenty native craft, large and small: of these, ten belonged to the governor. They trade with Berberah, Arabia, and Western India, and are navigated by “Rajput” or Hindu pilots. Provisions at Zayla are cheap; a family of six persons live well for about 30 l. per annum. The general food is mutton: a large sheep costs one dollar, a small one half the price; camels; meat, beef, and in winter kid, abound. Fish is rare, and fowls are not commonly eaten. Holcus, when dear, sells at forty pounds per dollar, at seventy pounds when cheap. It is usually levigated with slab and roller, and made into sour cakes. Some, however, prefer the Arab form “balilah,” boiled and mixed with ghee. Wheat and rice are imported: the price varies from forty to sixty pounds the Riyal or dollar. Of the former grain the people make a sweet cake called Sabaya, resembling the Fatirah of Egypt: a favourite dish also is “harisah”—flesh, rice flour, and boiled wheat, all finely pounded and mixed together. Milk is not procurable during the hot weather; after rain every house is full of it; the Bedouins bring it in skins and sell it for a nominal sum. Besides a large floating population, Zayla contains about 1500 souls. They are comparatively a fine race of people, and suffer from little but fever and an occasional ophthalmia. Their greatest hardship is the want of the pure element: the Hissi or well, is about four miles distant from the town, and all the pits within the walls supply brackish or bitter water, fit only for external use. This is probably the reason why vegetables are unknown, and why a horse, a mule, or even a dog, is not to be found in the place. to one of his substantial houses of coralline and mud plastered over with glaring whitewash.

A flight of steep steps leads into a long room with shutters to exclude the light, floored with tamped earth, full of “evening flyers” * “Fid-mer,” or the evening flyer, is the Somali name for a bat. These little animals are not disturbed in houses, because they keep off flies and mosquitoes, the plagues of the Somali country. Flies abound in the very jungles wherever cows have been, and settle in swarms upon the traveller. Before the monsoon their bite is painful, especially that of the small green species; and there is a red variety called “Diksi as,” whose venom, according to the people, causes them to vomit. The latter abounds in Gulays and the hill ranges of the Berberah country: it is innocuous during the cold season. The mosquito bites bring on, according to the same authority, deadly fevers: the superstition probably arises from the fact that mosquitoes and fevers become formidable about the same time. , and destitute of furniture. Parallel to it are three smaller apartments; and above is a terraced roof, where they who fear not the dew and the land-breeze sleep. * Such a building at Zayla would cost at most 500 dollars. At Aden, 2000 rupees, or nearly double the sum, would be paid for a matted shed, which excludes neither sun, nor wind, nor rain. I found a room duly prepared; the ground was spread with mats, and cushions against the walls denoted the Divan: for me was placed a Kursi or cot, covered with fine Persian rugs and gaudy silk and satin pillows.

Thus, though the Andaman Islander might have a vague realisation of the value of Hibiscus , for example, that would be something very different from the result on the mind of the individual of the regular use of the leaves of that tree in initiation ceremonies as a protection against unseen dangers. So that the protective uses of such things are really rites or ceremonies by means of which the individual is made to realise (1) his own dependence on the society and its possessions, and (2) the social value of the things in question.',\n",

A woman must be impregnated to conceive, but her impregnator is a gecko-spirit-man. Children are born by the ordinary route, but they converse while being born, and one bursts out from his mother's head. Both versions make casual use of much Tikopia cultural furniture which logically could come only later in the scheme of things--a wooden bowl, a bark-cloth belt, an assembly to determine the man responsible for a woman's pregnancy. Both versions also provide a traditional referent for major sectors of the Tikopia social system. The tale foreshadows the existence of the four clans by using clan names in referring to the deities, and in one case by stating baldly that they produced the modern chiefs. The tale also draws attention to the social importance of primogeniture in Tikopia, which is emphasized by the device whereby Tafito gained primacy over Semoana who would otherwise have been his elder brother. Perhaps here also is an expression in fantasy of sibling hostility, resolved in the tale by the victory of a younger over the eldest brother, though this victory is achieved only at a price--his disease and death endowment. The tale accounts also for the special association of Fangarere clan and chief with epidemic disease. Attributing hurricanes and other natural afflictions to the untimely breach of the birth process by Tafito, the tale implies a requirement of order in nature. It says in effect that disorder in one natural process is likely to be followed by disorder in another. (As another statement put it, illness and death lie with Tafito. As he sprang from the head of his mother, in anger she called out to him that sickness and death should go with him. And Tafito was the major Fangarere god.) In its second part, the incident with Tikarau the usurper, the tale provides a basis for an understanding of the “totemic” ascription of certain major foodstuffs to clan control, with attendant ritual procedures. 7 Firth, 1930-1, b.\",\n",

       "  'In order to feel himself to be a representative of the sun, the demon Zugí-mask ( zugí uákai ) had to have a very strange train of thought. He boasts in front of the priest Sivalukukui that he would be the sun of all peoples ( salinga gúatsi mama ), for he would protect against sickness to the ends of the directions with small offering stones. If any sickness were to come, he would close off the path of the sickness with a fence. But Sivalukukui denies that he could be the sun for all peoples ( 77 ). He could not be this, adds Trinidad Noivita in explanation, for he only attended to warding off sickness, not everything else, for instance, the harvest. According to the laws of sound change, Zugí corresponds to nugi, shell-lime, which is enjoyed with coca leaves. Sugi, the gourd container for the lime, is seemingly the same word. When Híuika brought the shells ( nuksuzua ) ( 4 . The word nugi, lime, is in most of the designations for shells and snails. Cf. nuksei, nukuluva, nukuva . ) from the sea in order to burn them at home in the mountains, he let himself be led astray to sleep with them, for they were girls. -- Such forbidden cohabitation is, in the belief of the Kagaba, always the cause of sickness. -- The shells avenged themselves, and after they were burned, there began the fever heat which the white ( 5 . Or the red ones; cf. 6, 3 /omitted in the translation/. ) shells brought, while the green ones brought the chills of fever. “So Híuika brought all kinds of sickness... Previously... one had begun to bar the path of sickness. But they went out and came in behind Híuika, since they were human beings” ( 6 , 3 ff.). Therefore, in usual fashion, the task of the Zugí mask, as demon of the burned shell-lime, is to influence the “fever heat” of the sicknesses brought into the mountains by the shells as a result of the burning. He is therefore also a kind of fire-demon. Now since one of the main tasks of the sun demons is 79 to ward off sickness approaching from the cardinal points, the Zugí mask wishes to do the same and to represent himself as “the sun of all peoples,” whereupon Priest Sivalukukui rightly told him that he could not possibly be the sun for all peoples, clearly because he had only limited powers over sicknesses coming from the sea, quite apart from the other tasks of the sun.',\n",

One of these parts, the noreshi , is capable of leaving the body; when it does so, the person becomes ill and dies unless it (the noreshi ) returns. The noreshi are inherited patrilineally for males and matrilineally for females. Each human noreshi has an animal or bird counterpart whose life is coextensive and coterminous with that of the human to which it corresponds. Many of the noreshi are types of animals commonly taken by hunters. Thus, when the Yanomaö kill game animals, they believe they also kill the human being to whom that noreshi corresponds. 1 They are not concerned about killing their own noreshi , for humans and their noreshi animals live in complementary distribution.
