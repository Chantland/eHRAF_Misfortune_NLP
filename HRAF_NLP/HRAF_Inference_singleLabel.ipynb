Such persons may also be called upon to injure another, as to induce insanity, blindness, lameness, discoloration of the face, distortion of the mouth, etc. On the other hand, there are owners of Cree medicine who have the power to remove or restore all injuries produced in this way. The usual procedure in such cases is to suck or otherwise draw something from the victim‚Äôs body which is then loaded into a gun and fired off, the belief being that the medicine at once returns to the one who sent it and entering his body afflicts him with the same injury. It is said that the medicine will reach him although a thousand miles away. An informant well versed in the Cree medicine states that he knew of its being used on a woman noted for her extra fine beadwork. In consequence of her skill in this line one of her neighbors became very jealous of her and so made medicine causing her skillful rival to suffer many months with a sore hand. After she had been unable to use her hand for a year a white doctor lanced it and found part of a needle in the palm. When the people heard of this they told the doctor that the needle had been shot into the woman‚Äôs hand by means of Cree medicine but he only laughed and said there was no such thing. So to prove that story, they told him to see how long he could keep this needle. Then he put it into a bottle and corked it up tightly but was greatly surprised the next day when he found that the bottle was still corked up but no needle inside. A year after this he cut another needle from the same woman‚Äôs hand. Later, it disappeared and turned up in one of her knees on account of which her leg has always been stiff. This woman is living to-day, so they say.',\n",

We do, however, recall a few cases in which sick men claim to have received such powers; but none of the more important rituals are assigned to such origins. The attitude toward alcoholic intoxication is uncertain because there seems to have been a gradual moral awakening to its evil effects, which may account for the present tendency to consider experiences so induced as of no particular consequence.

Another way in which the horse medicinemen may exert their power is when running buffalo in the winter when the ground is icy and they use their power to prevent their horses from slipping on the ice. There is still another way to show their power. When a man wishes to go to war to steal horses he goes to one of the horse medicinemen with a pipe filled with tobacco and asks for help. The horse medicineman paints him and gives him a small buckskin bag containing powdered medicine, tells him how it is to be used, and what songs to sing. The man desiring the power does not paint until the war party is within sight of the enemy‚Äôs camp. Then he paints his face as he was told, rubs his whole body and his rope with the medicine and ties it to his necklace. He then sings the songs of the horse medicine and tells what kind of horses he wishes. After one has been rubbed with the medicine any horse can be taken. If the rope is rubbed with the medicine he can never miss when throwing it. After a man is painted he must keep to one side of the warriors as they go towards the camp. He must not let anyone cross his tracks. If this does happen, the person doing it would at once become crippled in some manner. The one using the medicine usually drags his rope and never fails to procure a horse. During the trip a marrow bone must not be broken in the war lodge nor be heated by the fire while he is in it. For catching a wild horse the formula is to carry some of the medicine and ride about the animal in a circle.

Curiously enough, the violation, if such it be, cannot always be laid to the victim himself, since by social usage he may be forced to keep his seat while another is doing the very thing his medicine prohibits. For example, if metal must not be struck in the presence of a certain paintedtipi owner, it is not likely that he himself will violate the injunction, but he may be unable to prevent others from doing the striking.

       "  'passage': 'I asked Siksikakoan if he had ever known of a man being attacked by wolves. He said: ‚ÄúWolves and coyotes are very wise, their wisdom having been given to them by Napi (Old Man). Although savage by nature, they sometimes use their wisdom to help people when in danger and distress. I recall a strange incident that happened many years ago, when we were camped far out on the plains. It was a cold winter. There had been a big storm and the snow lay deep. Menepoka, an old man, went alone and on foot from camp to look for horses. He carried a quirt and was dragging a long rawhide lariat. He felt something tugging, and turning about, saw a large coyote biting at the other end of his lariat. He stopped and yelled at the coyote, calling him evil names to scare him away. The coyote trotted to the summit of a butte near by, and howled four times to the north, south, east and west. Before long another coyote appeared. Then another came running up to him, and they kept on coming, until Menepoka found himself surrounded by them. The terrible circle, with hideous cries, red mouths and glittering eyes, drew closer and closer. He tried to drive them away with his quirt, but without effect. He expected that, in a moment, they would rush upon him and tear him to pieces. He was old and not strong, and in his terror his legs gave way and he sank down into the snow. It happened that an Indian on horseback had ridden to the summit of a neighbouring butte looking for his horses. Hearing the coyote pack making an unusual outcry, he rode towards them, thinking they had made a kill of game they had run down in the snow. Discovering a human body lying on the ground, he gave a shrill cry and galloped towards them, shooting an arrow into their midst. The coyotes quickly scattered, and he then saw that it was Menepoka lying in the snow as if dead. Lifting him upon his horse he took him back to camp. Our medicine man tried to drive out the evil spirit, going through with the motions of pulling something from his body, explaining that, when the coyotes were closing in upon Menepoka, they were constantly shooting their hairs into him. But the incantations were of no avail, because the evil spirit was one over which the medicine man had no power. Menepoka lived for only a few days. When he died, his body was placed upon the summit of the high butte, where the famous chief Big Nose now lies. They both belonged to the Ich-poch-semo band (clan of Grease Melters).‚Äù',\n",

       "  'passage': 'It is impossible for the Christian races to understand, or estimate the powerful influence, which the ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù beliefs have for ages exerted upon the Indian character and tribal life. It being their universal belief that illness of the body signified possession by an evil spirit, their methods of healing, in common with those of all savage tribes, naturally took the form of incantation and occult ceremonies for exorcising it. No doubt the title of ‚Äúmedicine,‚Äù by which their doctors were known in our early chronicles of the Indians, had its origin in this manner with the early French colonists. By a natural transition it passed into that of ‚Äúmedicine men,‚Äù with English speaking people. A ‚Äúmedicine man‚Äù is believed to control the weather, to heal the sick and exorcise evil spirits by means of incantations and magic arts. He is really more of a magician than a medical doctor, although he constantly assumes the functions of the latter. His vocation is to instruct and guide in the avoidance of acts that are ‚Äúbad medicine‚Äù and therefore unlucky, and in the use of the best means for propitiating the Evil Power, because of unlucky acts already committed. When an Indian is ‚Äúmaking medicine,‚Äù he is performing mysterious ceremonies, or using other approved means for controlling the supernatural powers and averting the malevolence of the evil spirits. Some authorities have understood the word as meaning ‚Äúmystery,‚Äù and the medicine man as ‚Äúmystery man.‚Äù But this is not an adequate expression. While there is no corresponding word in the English language to express the equivalent of the Indian idea, the phrase ‚Äúsupernatural power‚Äù is probably the nearest equivalent to the word ‚Äúmedicine,‚Äù in its common Indian use.',\n",

       "  'passage': 'The Blackfeet had a Love medicine, which they called Ito-wa-mami-wa-natsi (Cree medicine), because it was generally obtained from the Crees, who were specialists in its manufacture. In talking with E-kum-makon about the Cree medicine, he said that he had used it to regain the affection of his young wife. When she left him and returned to her father‚Äôs lodge, he made a long journey north, to visit a Cree medicine man, from whom he purchased some of the Love medicine. It consisted of a small beaded buckskin bag containing a sweet-smelling powder. As the Cree magician had directed, he secured one of his wife‚Äôs hairs and, winding it with one of his own, placed them together in the medicine bag. He carried it with him everywhere, fastened around his neck by a buckskin string and wore it beneath his shirt. He firmly believed in its power, because his wife had returned and became so much attached to him, that she was unwilling to leave his side and they went everywhere together. Soon after this E-kum-makon had a severe illness, lasting so long he thought he must be bewitched by Little Plume, who owned a Porcupine-Quill medicine. It consisted of a small stone, or wooden image of a person, a porcupine quill and some red paint, by which the owner was able to cast an evil spell over people. If he placed the red paint between the eyes of the image, the one whom he desired to injure became ill; if over the lungs, he had a hemorrhage; if on the top of the head, he became crazy; if over the heart, it caused death. E-kum-makon became so worried over his health, that he again sought the advice of the Cree medicine man, who informed him that his sickness was caused by the improper use of the Love medicine. It should not have been carried around with him, but left inside his tipi, tied to one of the lodge poles, where it properly belonged. The medicine man also explained, that it was wrong to put the hairs into the bag without the burning of incense, which was necessary to ward off the Evil Power.',\n",

If they catch a man unawares and offer the Pipe to him, he dare not refuse, lest sickness or even death come to him, or to some member of his family. The Medicine Pipe was given to the Blackfeet long ago, when the Thunder struck down a man. While he lay on the ground, the Thunder Chief appeared in a vision, showing him a pipe, and saying, ‚ÄòI have chosen you that I might give you this Pipe. Make another just like it. Gather together also a medicine bundle, containing the skins of the many animals and birds, which go with it. Whenever any of your people are sick, or dying, a vow must be made and a ceremonial given with a feast. The sick will then be restored to health.‚Äô The Grizzly Bear afterwards appeared to this same man, and said to him, ‚ÄòI give you my skin to wrap around the sacred bundle, because it is larger than the skins of other animals. Whenever you transfer the Pipe to anyone, steal quietly upon him just before daybreak, the time I am on the move, and take him by surprise, just as I do, chanting my song, and making the sound of a bear charging. When you catch a man and offer him the Pipe, he will not dare to refuse, but must accept it and smoke. It is sure death to refuse, because no one may dare to turn away from a grizzly bear.‚Äô',\n",

In 1889, the Blackfoot population stood at 815; in 1896, it reached 1,226; but since the death rate was nearly double the birth rate, the future did not look auspicious. Indeed, in 1901, the population dropped to 975; two years later, it had declined by another one hundred; and by 1910 the number dropped to 768. Although the Blackfoot were vaccinated against smallpox in 1910, no one had the means to cure tuberculosis. For the family of Chief Crowfoot, this disease proved to be especially tragic.

The Crow gave him some seeds of a small plant with a song, which gave him a membership. After a time he dreamed of six dwarfs and they gave him power to get horses, property, food, and long life. Since that time he has always had abundance. When he came back to the Piegan, he sold or transferred to Curly-bear some of his power and since that time the latter has prospered. He claims that all of the members are prosperous. When a member is taken in he is given the skin of an otter, blackbird, weasel, beaver, or something with a song. These songs must have been dreamed by some of the members. Women can be taken in alone, but if married, both husband and wife must join; likewise when a man joins, his wife must enter. A man joins by calling upon a member, making him gifts and asking him for some of the Crow-water power. These gifts are supposed to be many quilts, horses, etc. Each member gives him some object and an associated song. The members receiving the gifts must divide them among other members as far as they will go, one thing for each. Each one receiving a horse must contribute some object, a song and some power, the others are free to choose. Thus, the highest price paid for membership brings the most medicines. The objects are placed in a bundle which becomes the new member‚Äôs individual medicine. They are not treated as most medicine bundles, but may be opened at any time. In the ceremonies the women usually do the dancing. The men seldom dance out do the singing. The women do not sing when they are dancing. There are no regular times for meetings, but it is usual to hold them every Sunday and at the time of the new moon. Ceremonies are held in compliance with vows of outsiders or members as with other medicines, but they may meet on any occasion. The number of members is not limited in any way. None of the proceedings are secret. Everybody may look in, but only members can come inside of the tipi or ceremonial circle. The members usually paint their faces yellow, with red bars across the mouth and forehead. A rectangle of red is also made upon the backs of the hands. A few plumes and feathers are worn on the head. There are no other regalia, the chief things being the individual bundles of the members. The taboos observed by bundle owners are also in evidence. Neither marrow nor bones may be placed in the fire or the owner‚Äôs horse will have his leg broken. Lodge pins must not be put in the fire or the owner will have a tumor (?); nor must iron be put in the fire and allowed to become red hot, or the owner‚Äôs teeth will fall out. If lodge poles are burnt up, horses will die. The owner must not touch moccasins while smoking; he will have a seabby mouth. Moccasins placed under the bed will bring bad luck. When dancing and smoking, if one should pass in front of him, the smoker goes blind. He must not lend a blanket to another as this will bring bad results. The medicine formula or power may be used as follows:‚ÄîIf a member wishes a horse, he calls in other members and sings the songs and offers prayers. It is believed that one so doing will soon be called upon for some service and receive a horse as a fee. Other wishes may be gratified in the same way. An outsider desiring anything may formally announce that he provides food and presents for a meeting. Then members assemble and hold a meeting. This is usual in sickness.

Then he would go out and wander about the prairie, repeating to himself, ‚ÄúThis bone says all the buffalo will go down the drive and over the cliff.‚Äù Then he would throw the bone out in front of him. If it fell with the yellow side up, it would be as he said. At another time he would take a bone, lay a stick across it, and then drop a braid of sweet-grass. If the braid fell on the stick hanging, the buffalo would go over. 2 2 The braid of grass hanging across the stick was explained as symbolizing meat hanging up to dry, in turn the symbol of plenty. These things people do even to this day. When Whirlwind-Boy was a man and his mother very old, he said to her one day, ‚ÄúMother, I think I shall go away before you die. I do not care to be here when that happens.‚Äù His mother asked him not to go, but he was not easily moved. At last, however, he agreed to take her with him. So he called the people of the camp together and requested all to watch. He took his mother over to the top of a high cliff; then he went back some distance and became a whirlwind. When the whirlwind reached the place where the mother sat, she disappeared. No one ever saw them again. 3 3 This story accounts for some of the practices in the care of children. The navel-cord amulet for boys is in the shape of a snake; for girls, in the shape of a lizard or a horned toad.

Scraping White showed the writer soars on his legs resulting from the sacrifice of pieces of flesh to the sun prior to the year of his torture experience. Nevertheless, the belief of the Piegan that men who submitted to the torture would not live long after they had given their bodies to the sun, appears to have been based upon religious fear rather than the life histories of men who had been tortured. Several of our elderly South Piegan informants recalled having seen older men of the tribe who bore the scars of the torture. The severity of the torture varied with the depth of the incisions. Older men watched the suppliant carefully, and did not permit the torture to be prolonged indefinitely. Even in the case of Heavy Head, whose experience was described by other elderly Blood Indians as the most severe punishment they had witnessed in sun dance tortures, the performance lasted only a few minutes. His narrative indicates the pain and nervous shock must have been intense. But in the majority of cases it probably did no permanent damage to the individual. Although Scraping White and Heavy Head still bear the scare of their torture, these men appear to be in fair health, active of mind and body, nearly six decades after they expiated their vows to the sun in the Blood medicine lodge in the summer of 1889.',\n",

Persons bitten by a mad wolf generally went mad, too. They trembled and their limbs jerked, they made their jaws work and foamed at the mouth, often trying to bite other people. When any one acted in this way, his relations tied him hand and foot with ropes, and, having killed a buffalo, they rolled him up in the green hide, and then built a fire on and around him, leaving him in the fire until the hide began to dry and burn. Then they pulled him out and removed the buffalo hide, and he was cured. While in the fire, the great heat caused him to sweat profusely, so much water coming out of his body that none was left in it, and with the water the disease went out, too. All the old people tell me that they have seen individuals cured in this manner of a mad wolf‚Äôs bite.',\n",

       "  'passage': \"Now, to make this Drum useful, there are two Things required; an Index and a Hammer. The First shews the Thing desired by pointing at some certain Figure on the Drum, with the other they beat the Drum. I call that an Index , what Samuel Rheen calls a Bunch of Rings made of Metal . For when they make use of the Drum, they take a pretty large Ring, on which they hang several small ones, all which make up a Bunch. Tho' they also sometimes vary in this Point. One of those I have by me, is made of a thick Piece of Copper, about the bigness of a Crown Piece, with a square Hole in the middle; and instead of the small Rings, it is hung round about with little Copper Chains. The other is made of Brass, on which hangs a round Copper Plate, fastned to little Chains. I have also seen some made of Bones, resembling in shape the Greek Letter , with Rings hanging about them; and of other different Shapes. Mine. I have given you a Draught of, with the two Drums A. B. mark'd with G . However since they most commonly make use of a Ring (those Drums sent me by my Lord Chancellor, having no others than such) this is the reason, why the so often-mentioned anonymous M. S. has call'd them barely Rings. The Ring , says he, laid upon the Drum, did not stand still in any certain Place. Olaus Magnus calls them Brazen Serpents or Toads : For so they call those Rings, not that they are really such, or have any resemblance to Serpents or Toads, but because by those Rings they represent those Creatures, which they look upon to be very acceptable to the Devil, and whose Pictures they frequently make use of in their Magick. Peucerus calls them Frogs, They have likewise , says he, a brazen Frog, fastned to an Iron Bar : Perhaps because there is no great difference betwixt a Toad and a Frog. Which makes Olaus Petri say: In the Center they draw the Picture of their God, upon which they lay a Frog or some other Piece made of Brass. Torn us tells us that the Laplanders call it Arpa. The Index , says he, which they cali Arpa, is composed out of several Chain Rings, made of Copper, Iron, Brass or Silver : Which shews us, that they are not only made of Brass, but also of several other Metals. The Hammer they call that same Instrument, wherewith they beat the Drum, as we may see from what has been alledged out of Olqus Magnus and Johannes Torn us ; the Last of which says; They raise their Familiar Spirits by beating the Skin with a Hammer . But this Hammer must be imagined to have the least resemblance to a Smith's Hammer, as the Engraver of Olaus Magnus's had failly persuaded himself, but it is a certain Instrument so call'd by the Laplanders , and dedicated to this peculiar use, made of a Raindeer's Horn, branching out like a Fork; this being the Head of the Hammer, the rest the Handle. The true Shape of it I have given you in the same Cut, which contains the two Drums under A . and B . the Hammer being mark'd with H. With this Hammer they beat the Drum, not so much to make a Noise, but thereby to put the Ring, laid upon the Skin, into motion, so as to pass over the Pictures, till they are satisfied in what they look for. And thus I have given you a description of the Lapland Drum , with all its Appertinencies, viz . the Ring and the Hammer, such as they use among the Laplanders , subject to the Crown of Sweden . The Finlanders , bordering upon Norway , and subject to Denmark , do likewife use those Drums, but something different of those I have described to you just now; as is manifest from the Description given of them by the learned Olaus Wormius . It is however my Opinion, That the difference betwixt theirs and ours is not real, but rather accidental; arising from thence, that the Drum described by Wormius , was perhaps intended for some particular use. But let us see, for Wormius describes the Drum he makes mention of in the Description of his Study; The Lapland Drum , says he, which they use in their Magick, and by beating which, to a certain Tune, they pretend to discover many Things, is made of an oval Piece of Wood bollowed; its Length is about a Foot, its Bredth ten Inches, having six Ho'es cut in it with a Handle in the middle; whereby they hold it with the left Hand, whilst they beat with the Right. Over this they stretch a Skin. fasined to it with Nerves, painted with divers rude Shap'd Figures, drawn with Blood or some other Red Colour. Upon this lies a Piece of Brass in the Shape of a Rhomboides, somewhat convex, its Diameter being of two Inches, in the Middle of which, and on each Corner, bangs a small Brass Chain. The Instrument made of Bone, wherewith they beat the Drum, is about six Inches long. of the thickness of a little Finger, resembling the Latin T. The Laplanders use this Drum upon divers Occasions. and pretend to do great Matters by the help of it; which makes them have it in great Esteem, and keep it with much Reverence; they secure and wrap it up together with the Index and Hammer in a Lambskin. The Laplanders, says Samuel Rheen, set a great value upon their Drum, for they always keep it wrap'd up, together with the Rings and Hammer, in a Lamb-Skin . Thus it is in my Edition, tho' I have found it in another written Loomskin , which does not signifie a Lamb-Skin, but the Skin of a certain Bird, of the Water Fowl kind, and is in this Country called Loom. Wormius has given us a Description of it in his Study, and I shall perhaps have an Opportunity of describing it more at large, when I shall publish a Catalogue of the Rarities I preserve in my Study. Nay, they look upon this Drum as a Sacred Thing, which for this Reason, must not be touch'd by marriagable Women. No Woman , says the same author, that is come to Age of Maturity, is permitted to touch the Drum . If the Drum is to be removed from one Place to another, it is either carried last of all, and by the Hands of a Man, or else must be brought by a quite different Road, or some untrod Way. The Drum , says the same Author, never goes First, but Last of all, being carried by a Man, and not a Woman; somesimes thro' such Roads as were never made use of before . He gives us likewise the Reason of it, viz . Because they are afraid, that if any Body, but especially a Woman should pass the same way after it, would be in great danger of losing either her Health, or perhaps her Life; and this Hazard they run for the first three Days after; of which they do give you several Instances. They will tell you, says he, that if any Woman Kind, that is come to Age of Maturity, should travel the same Road, thro' which the Drum has been carried, within three Days before, the same would either dye immediately, or at least fall into some great Misfortune, and this they prove by many Instances . It seems as if the Devil would not have his Worship despised, but keeps a strict Hand over those who neglect his Rites, by punishing them severely, as far as God is pleased to permit; so that there is no great reason to doubt of the Truth of those Examples. Now, because it happens sometimes, Women must of necessity travel the same way, the Devil is somewhat more favourable to them, provided they pay him, as an Acknowledgment, a Ring of Brass, to the same Drum, that was carried that way before them. If it so happen , says the before-mentioned Author, that a Woman is forced to travel the same way, thro' which the Drum has been carried before, she is abliged to present a Brass Ring for the use of the said Drum . But since we have told you before, that according to their Opinion, they can effect strange Things, by the help of this Drum, we must take a view, what these Things are, and how they are performed. Olaus Petri mentions Three; relating either to their Hunting, to their Sacrifices, and the enquiring into far distant Matters. They have , says he, a threefold use for this Drum, in relation to their Hunting, Sacrifices, and the knowledge of Things at a distance. Samuel Rheen mentions Four. The First , To enquire what passes in other Places, tho' never so remote. The Second , To know the good and bad Success of any Undertaking, and what issue any Distemper is like to have. The Third , To Cure Diseases. The Fourth , To know what sort of Sacrifice their Gods are pleased with, and what kind of Beasts each God desires for his Sacrifice. They don't all use the same way or Ceremonies, in making their Enquiries. There are however several Circumstances which are to be observed by all. The First is, That they take care to stretch the Skin very stiff, by holding it near the Fire. They hold , says Olaus Petri, the Skin to the Fire, to make it Stiff . Secondly, That they don't always beat in one Place, but round about the Index or Ring. Thirdly, That they first begin to beat softly, and so continue stronger and stronger, till they have done their Business. Torn us says to this effect: He lifts up the Drum a little, and then beats round about the Index, first softly till the Index begin to stir and to move about, and when he finds it removed from the Place where it first laid, to one or the other side of the Drum, the Drummer beats harder and harder, till the Index Points at a certain Sign, from whence they may draw a Conjecture as to the Point they sought for . Another Ceremony they constantly observe, is, That he who beats the Drum, does it upon his Knees, not standing, and so do all the rest that are present. He that is skilful in this Art , says the same Author, falls down upon his Knees, as well as all the rest, and so he takes the Drum . As to the Occasions, of their beating the Drum, we having given you the last of them already; we must now proceed to the rest, the first of which is, to know, what is transacted in far distant Places; concerning which Olaus Magnus speaks to this effect; If they are solicitous to know in what Condition their Friends or Foes are, tho' at 500 or 1000 Leagues distance, they go to a Lap or Einlander, whom they know well skill'd in this Art, and by the means of a Present of a Linnen Sute of Cloths, or some Mony, they oblige him to try his Skill, to know what their Friends or Foes are doing at that time, and where they are . And so he proceeds to give an Account of the whole manner of doing it, of which we shall say A In Deser. Norway. more anon. Peter Clandi , speaking of the Finlanders under the Jurifdiction of Norway , says: They are so Skilful in this Art, that they can satisfie any Body, that wants to know, what other People are doing, at a great distance . He likewise relates the manner of performing it, and gives us an Instance, which happened at Bergen , the chief Trading City of Norway , which is to be seen upon record there, viz . in the publick Register of the German Factory: There was one John Delling , living in that City, in the Quality of a Factor, of a certain German Merchant, who meeting one time with a Friend of his called James Smausuend , who had a certain Norwegian Finlaplander in his Company, he ask'd him, whether he could tell him, what his Master was then doing in Germany? The Finlaplander having answered him he could, began immediately to make a great Noise, as if he were Drunk, then leaping and turning himself several times round in a Circle, he fell upon the Ground without any Sense or Motion; after he had continued thus for some time, he recovered out of his Trance, started up, and told him, what his Master was transacting in Germany ; which being immediately entred into the Register of the German Merchants, was found, upon enquity made afterwards, to agree with what the Finlaplander had told him. A memorable Instance, which deserves the more Credit, as being confirmed by publick Authority. There are besides this many more Inslances of this kind, related upon the Credit and Experience of those now living, among which, that which happned to Johannes Torn us deserves to be taken particular Notice of; a certain Laplander , who is still living, having told him all what happned to him in his first Journey into Lapland ; he never having seen him before, These are his Words; He told me truly and exactly every thing that bad happned to me in my Journey into Eapland: And, notwithstanding I was sensible of the Truth of what the Laplander had told me, concerning this journey, I told him, that what he had said was altogether false; for fear he sbould glory in his Diabolical Art, or rely upon it, as a means to investigate Truth . There is not the least shew of Reason, to Question the Truth of this Relation, being founded upon the Authority' of a Person not in the least addicted to Superstition, who speaks by his own Experience. The Authors however differ in the Method, used in making those Discoveries. Olaus Magnus describes it thus: The Drummer goes into some private Room, accompanied only by one Person, besides his own Wife. Then by beating upon the Anvil with his Hammer be moves the Brazen Frog or Serpent about the Figures, muttering at the same time certain Words; till he falls into a Trance, lying extended on the Ground, as if Dead: His Companion in the mean while taking great Care, that no Gnat, Flie or any other living Creature touch him. By the force of his Charms, his Soul is by some evil D mon or other carryed into some distant Place, from whence he brings back (as a Token that be has executed his Commission) a Ring, Knife, or some such Thing; which, so soon as he rises from the Ground, he shews, and declares to his Companion. Peter Claudi gives us the following Account of it: He falls upon the Ground without any Life or Motion, turning quite yellow or Black in the Face. Thus he continues for One or more Hours, according to the distance of the Place, of which enquiry is to he made. When he recovers from this Trance, he is able to tell what passes in that Place, and what those People transact there, of which Enquiry was made . Here no mention is made either of a Drum, Song, his Companions, or any Tokens of the Performance of the Business; which difference must be attributed to this, that each Author gives an Account of what seem'd most worth taking notice of to him, without excluding the rest, mentioned by others; so that from what has been said already, the use of the Drum can scarce be call'd in question; but what Olaus Petri relates of the Drums, made for this particular use, viz . That they have a Handle shaped like a Cross, deserves our special Observation. The Drum they make use of, says he, is the same as I deseribed to you before, with this difference only, that the lower part of it is divided into four Parts, by a Cross, by which the Sorcerer bolds it with one Hand . Here you find a Handle made in the shape of a Cross, of which make is the Drum, which I told you was prefented to me by my Lord Henry Flemming , Colonel of a Finland Regiment of Foot, the Draught of the lower Side of which you see in the next following Figure.\",\n",

       "  'passage': \"The Second is to find out a proper Remedy, viz . what Sort of Sacrifice will be most pleasing to their Gods, but especially to Storjunkare , without whose peculiar Favour they never hope to recover their Health. The beforementioned Author proceeds thus: This done, the Patient must make a Vow of a certain Sacrifice, of a Raindeer, Buil, He-Goat or Ram, or something else of this Kind, to be offered to some certain Storjunkare, dwelling in some certain Mountain or other . Neither is it left to the Choice of the Patient, but to the direction of the Drum-beater; it being his Province to prescribe, what they ought to do. Whatever the Drummer orders the Patient to do , says the same Author, he must perform, and either Sacrifice immediately, or at least promise to offer such a Sacrifice at a certain appointed Time . For it is the Business of him, who beats the Drum, to enquire (as I told you before) which of the Gods the Sacrifice is to be offered to, and what kind of Sacrifice will be acceptable to him; for the same Sacrifice is not pleasing to every one of their Gods, neither is the same God satisfied with one kind of Sacrifices at all times; so that the choice of it depends on the Manager of the Drum, whose direction the sick Person is to follow. The manner of performing it, is thus described by Samuel Rheen: When they pretend to Cure any Distemper by the help of the Drum, it is done in the following manner: The Patient must present the Drummer with two Rings, as a Reward for his Pains, one of Brass, the other of Silver; both which he tyes to his right Arm. The Drummer, after having put those two Rings in the same Bunch, which commonly is made use of, as often as the Drum is employed for those Purposes, beats the said Drum, singing all the while, as do likewise all the Men and Women there present, the first with a loud Voice, the latter somewhat lower . From the Motion and Position of the Rings, the Drum-beater makes his Conjecture, as we told you before. Lundius gives the following Account concerning this Method: If a Laplander happen to fall Sick in the Lapmark of Uma , they send for the next Neighbour, whom they think most expert in the management of the Drum. The first Thing to be done after his coming is, to Sacrifice one of the best Raindeer, belonging to the sick Body, or to his best Friend; then he begins to beat his Drum, and falling on the Ground, remains there for some time unmoveable, his Body being as hard as a Stone. In the mean while the rest there present sing a certain Song, which they have been taught by him beforehand, till he recovers his Senses, arises, takes up his Drum, and holding it up to his Head, beats it softly for some small time. After which he sits down very pensive, and begins to give them an Account of his Transactions; he tells them, that he has passed thro' the Body of the Terrestrial Globe, where he has met with the Antipodes, being conducted by his Genius, among a People of a very handsome and venerable Aspect; those People, he says, being advertised of his coming, had shut their Gates against him, but that by the affistance of his Genius, he had got among them thro' a Hole, where he had seen something belonging to the Sick Person, either his Hat, his Shoes, or perhaps his Mittens, or some such like Thing, which he was either able or unable to bring away. Their gencral Opinion is, That if the Drummer did bring it away, there is great Hopes of the Patients recovery, but if not, that he will Dye, and endure a great deal of Pain. And because they are fully persuaded, that the Soul of the Drummer does actually leave his Body and is carried to the Place he Names to them; they say that his Soul is brought back by his Genius over the highest Rocks and Mountains, with such swiftness, that the Sand and Stones doe flye about like Hail. Mr. Paul Venetus relates something not unlike this of the Tartars of the Province of Areladam . And these are the Things commonly performed by this Drum.\",\n",

       "  'passage': \"The Laplanders , notwithstanding they undergo a great deal of Hardship, yet enjoy a great share of Health. The Natives , says Olaus Petri Niurenius, are so healthful, that they neither have nor want any Physicians . And Samuel Rheen, The Laplanders are of a strong Constitution, being seldon afflicted with any of those Distempers which are frequent among other Nations . They scarce know what Sickness is, not so much as those Epidemical Distempers which sometimes afflict whole Nations. There is no such thing as putrid or burning Fevers, or the Plague in Lapland. In Lapland, says the same Author, you meet with no burning Fevers or the Plague ; nay if any Contagion be transferred thither, it loses its Virulency. Qlaus Petri Niurenis says, Some years ago a Pestilential Contagion was transported into Lapland, but no body was kill'd by it, except the Women that in Spinning choused it; for the coldncss of the Northern Climate soon disperses the viralent Vapours . Their only Epidemical Distemper is sore Eyes, which are often the Forerunners of Blindness; this is attributed to their constant sitting in their Huts, from their Infancy, which are both Winter and Summer pestred with Smoak. Their ordinary Disease , says he, is Sore Eyes; for the continual Smoak in their Huts, is so offensive to them, that most lose their Eye-sight as they grow old. Eric Plantin attributes the cause of it, besides the Smoak, to the light of the Fire. The Laplanders, says he, grow for the most part Blind at last, without question, because from their very Infancy they sit constantly in the Smoak and near the Fire . The same is confirmed by Olaus Petri Niurenius the Elder: Their greatest Trouble and Misery is, that they lose their Eye-sight when they grow old; this being a Disease more to them than any other Nation. This proceeds from their continual looking upon the Fire from their Infancy, which burns Day and Night, in the Winter and Summer, in the midst of their Huts . a Lundius is of Opinion, that the Mountaineers are Blinded by the Violent reflection of the Sun Beams upon the Ice and Snow of the Mountains. They are also sometimes troubled with the Plurisy, Inflammation of the Lungs, Pains in the Back, and Giddiness in the Head. Mr. Eric Plantin , in his Answer to my Letter says, Their most common Distempers are, the Pleurisy, Pains in the Brest and Back, and Dizziness in the Hend . And sometimes also the Small-Pox; for he adds, Sometimes they are inflicted with the Small-Pox . As they are subject but to few Distempers, so they √†re Strangers to Physicians. Their universal Remedy against Internal Distempers are the Roots of a certain Moss call'd by them Jerth , or for want of those, the Stalks of Angelica. Their general Medicine, says Plantin, against any Internal Distempers is the Root of Moss, call'd Jerth; instead of which they substitute in those Places where it grows not, the Angelica, call'd by them Fadna, which is to be found every where. Lundius adds the Beavers Kidneys steep'd in Brandy. They boil the Angelica in Whey of Raindeers Milk, as I told you it was their Custom in that Chapter of their Diet. Samuel Rheen says of this, They use it likewise for a Medicine. Against the Scurvy , says Lundius , they drink Raindeers Blood; when they are afflicted with the Tooth-Ach (which is but seldom) they make a Tooth-Pick of the Wood of a Tree, which has been struck with Lightning, with this they pick their Teeth till they Bleed. Against the Pain in the Back, they anoint themselves with Grease of Serpents, or wear Beavers Teeth on the back-side of their Girdle; others have a Superstition, that if they turn themselves round extended upon the Ground, the first time they hear it Thunder in the Spring, this Cures all the Aches in the Back. When they are afflicted with Pains in their Limbs, they apply fired Chips, which occasioning an Ulcer, they pretend by that means to draw the viscous Humour thither, and to mitigate the Pain. Their common Remedy is , says Plantin, to take fired Chips, or the Moss growing on the Birch-Tree; this they apply to the Place where the Pain lies; if they hit it right, the Moss will fall off, of it self, and the subsequent ulcer removes the Pain. To their Wounds they use no other Plaisters, than the Rosin, which the Trees sweat out. If they are wounded , says he, they apply Rosin instead of a Plaister . If their Limbs are benummed with Cold, their Raindeers Cheese supplies them with an Infallible Medicine; they thrust a red hot Iron into the Cheese, and with the Oil, that distils from thence, anoint the affected Part, with incredible Success. Some apply the Cheese it self, cut in thin Slices; If their Limbs be spoiled by the Cold , says Olaus Petri, this Cheese they cut in thin Slices, and appyed warm is a present Remedy . They likewise boil this Cheese in Milk, against a Cough, and all other Distempers of the Breast and Lungs, arising from Cold; they drink it Hot. It is also a good Stomachick to rectifie the Indigestion of the Stomach, occasioned by drinking too much Water. This Cheese, says Olaus Petri, is good for the Stomach, when it is spoiled with taking too much Water . For the rest, as they are seldom troubled with any Distempers, so they commonly arrive to a great Age. As the Laplanders, says Samucl Rheen, are not subject to any dangerous Distempers, so they grom old, even to a great Age . He says some live above a Hundred, but most Seventy, Eighty or Ninery Years; notwithstanding which, they lose not much of their natural Vigour, being able to traverse the highest Mountains, and thickest Woods, and manage all other Affairs as before, neither get they any gray Hairs till they are very Old; They seldom grow Gray, says he. So that most of the Laplanders Dye rather for Age, than by any Distemper. But when ever any one is dangerously Ill, either by Age, or some Distemper, they have recourse to their Drum, to know whether he will recover or die, as I have told you before concerning their Drum. Mr. Matthias Steuchius, in his Letter written to me, has these Words: I remember, that a certain Laplander told me, that they can by their Drum, know the Hour and manner of Death of the Patient . And Eric Plantin says; They pretend to enquire by their Drum, whether the Patient will Live or Dye . After they are satisfied, he cannot live long, if any Pious and good Christians are prelent, they exhort the dying Person, to think of God and Christ. I was told, says Eric Plantin, by an old gray Headed Laplander, who formerly went to School at Pitha, that those who are well instructed in the Christian Religion, used to exhort the Patient to remember God . But such as are no great Admirers of the Christian Religion, are careful only about the Funeral Feast, which they begin sometimes, before the Patient is expired. One Thomas, says Steuchius, a rich Laplander, being desperately Ill, beyond all Hopes of Recovery, sent for his Friends and Relations. These finding him to draw near his end, went to an Inn, where those that travel to Norway and Jempterland, used to lodge; there they stay'd a whole Day, which they spent it drinking of Strong-Beer and Brandy, the best Sacrifice they could make him, whilst yet alive, and then returning to the Hut, found him Dead . This being an Instance of a later Date, gives us sufficient reason to make due Reflections upon the just Complaints inserted in the introduction to the Grant of K. Gustave Adolph for creating a Lapland School, where among other Matters he says of the Laplanders: Those which live in the remotest Parts, among the Mountains of Norway, if they are Sick, and destitute of all Comfort, there being no Body, who administers the Sacrament to them, but they Dye without Consolation or Absolution. He alledges the Reason; Because the Devil at that nick of Time makes use of all his Tomptations, to become Masier of their Souls , viz. The Devil insinuates into them, to neglect all these Things, as vain Inventions, so that instead of those of their Friends that are good Christians, they send for such, as take more Care of their Belly's, than the Salvation of the Sick Person. But whenever any of them Dies, let the Distemper be what it will, they all forsake the Hut, where the Dead Carcass lies; it being their Opinion, that there is something remaining still of the Dead (as I told you before) such as the ancient Latines call'd Manes , and that not always of a Benign, but sometimes of a malignant Nature, which makes them dread any Dead Carcass; They are fearful of the Dead, says Samuel Rheen, for no sooner does any Body dye, but they leave the Place the same Day .\",\n",

To elude the Effects of Charms, they never kill a Beast, or make a Slaughter, but they throw some part away, upon which the effect of the Charm is to fall; nay, they are so far entangled in Superstition, that if within a few Weeks after Baptism, the Child happen to fall ill, or pine away, they Rebaptize it, alledging, that the first Name was not agreable to its Constitution, tho' very severe Laws have been enacted against it. The worst of all is, that they are so Tenacious of these Superstitions, and so obstinate in the perseverance of their antient Customs, that nothing is able to divert them from it. Of this there have been several Instances of late Years; for these Peasants, as I told you before, being not permitted to purchase any Lands, but obliged to live upon the Allotments granted to them by their Lords, for the bare sustenance of their Families, will sometimes cut or burn down some Woods, and Manure the Ground, which produces good Wheat; this they hide for Sale; but if they happen to be catch'd, they are strip'd to the middle, and ty'd to a Post, where they are soundly whipt with a Switch, till the Blood issues forth on all Sides; I say, there are many Instances of such among the Livonian Peasants, who rather than redeem this Chastisement by a small pecuniary Mulct of about 18 or 16 Pence, have chosen to submit readily to the Punishment, alledging, that rather than introduce any Novelty of this Kind, they would suffer the same Chastisement their Fore-fathers used to do before them.\",\n",

The borders of an iron wound are pressed first on one side, then on the other, and at the same time it is blown upon. It may also be soaked with urine and covered with a thin piece of inner birchbark. Some Lapps boil nails in water, then wash the wound with this water three times. 3 The Lapps also used alum-water (ANDE IN, Oulun Lehti 1881, n:o l; U.). Others heat a birchbranch until a sticky, brown liquid begins to ooze forth and then apply this liquid to the wound (U.). The Inari-Lapps put the aried chest-fat of a bear or ‚Äúsettled‚Äù reindeer or sheep fat on such a wound; a mixture of pitch and melted reindeer or dog fat may also do. In case of a rupture of the vein in a hand, the wound is closed with a heated knife. In the summer, the Inari reindeer-Lapps wash a larger wound with water; in the winter they wash and rub the wound itself with snow. They take salt in their mouths, then press the wound with their tongue, at the same time sucking out blood, which is spat out. Blood is not sucked out of large wounds, they are covered with salt or salt water. The wound may be sprinkled with the spore-dust of a puffball ( Lycoperdon bovista ), 1 Similarly QVIGSTAD, Lapp. Heilkunde, p. 105. -- Enonteki√∂: the puffball ( st alu-pur's√¢ , kied'de-spab'b√¢ ) is placed on the wound (Aili Leinon kok. 1947). mixed with pitch-water ( pihk'k√¢-t s ahttsi ); the latter is obtained when boiling pinepitch in a small quantity of water. The mixture is put on the wound and covered with a bandage (I. reind.-L.). Fresh pine-pitch is an excellent remedy on wounds; it is usually covered with a thin piece of inner birchbark (U.). The Kolt-Lapps also use pine-pitch or a mixture of boiled spruce-pitch (or tar) and candle-wax. -- The wound may also be covered with a mouse-skin, hair inwards, which has previously been sprinkled with the spore-dust of a puffball; it is tied with rags. An injured finger may be covered with a leather sheath spread with spore-dust. If a wound will not stop bleeding it has to be strewn with ground coffee. Another method is to let some blood drop onto a red-hot cobblestone; the emerging steam will stanch the flow of blood (I. reind.-L.). The Utsjoki-Lapps had still another method: a hole was drilled in a tree and some blood from the wound was poured into the hole, which was then obstructed with a peg. -- The wound may also be covered with a thin membrane from a hide 1 Similarly QVIGSTAD, p. 99. or with a film of birchbark. 2 Similarly DRAKE, p. 260. Twenty-four hours later the membrane begins to tighten, and it is then changed. A large wound, e.g. one made with an ax in the foot, which will not stop bleeding, may in winter be healed with a thin, still-warm slice of meat or the lights of a recently slaughtered reindeer. In some regions such reindeer are slaughtered by being stabbed in the neck and not in the heart as is the usual way; the patient should in addition eat a piece of meat, raw and unsalted. Cold meat is heated in warm water. The wound is then covered with a piece of rag (northeast I. reind.-L.). The Utsjoki-Lapps place a slice of frozen lights on such a wound. Stanching the flow of blood is called v ar√¢ pis'se h te√§bme . 3 There is a Lapp woman in Enonteki√∂ who is able to stanch the bleeding of a person living in another locality, if only she is informed of his/her name (Aili Leinon kok. 1947). -- A live frog is pressed against a suppurating wound (e.g. for as long as it takes to make coffee). A fresh or suppurating wound may also be healed with boiled tar. 4 For suppurating wounds also pitch oil (E.). The Kolt-Lapps use the thin membrane underneath the birchbark (‚Äújulmu‚Äù) on such a wound. The wound can also be soaked with lye obtained from ashes. -- Bleeding wounds occasioned by the bites of dogs or other animals are stanched with salt; the wound is then smeared with sour fat and bandaged. If a hunter is bitten by a bear, the wounds have to be rubbed with the bear's bile, and the rest of the bile is drunk by the bitten hunter (Sodankyl√§-Lapps). -- Scabs are smeared once a day with reindeer-marrow or sour fat to prevent them from chapping. This is probably what Fellman refers to when he writes that wounds and abscesses are healed with reindeer-marrow or tar and pine-pitch melted in fat. 1 J.F., III, p. 163; compare DRAKE, pp. 261-2: Fat or pitch.

He should be given a cold compress (snow inside a piece of cloth) on his eyes and should lie down in the shelter or at home for at least 24 hours. To prevent snow blindness ( t s√¢lbme-sud'dom ; t s√¢lmiht suovg√¢ h tuvveh , I. t salm eh koddojeh ) in early spring, the Lapps remain in a dark stable or look inside through a steaming sheep-barndoor until their eyes begin to fill with tears. If there are no sheep, they will wash their eyes with their own, warm urine, as many as three or four times a day. Other Lapps dye a piece of cotton fabric black and make a cap ( pe√§i've-suo 'g√¢ ) which they press down to the nostrils on bright days. The ordinary cap is placed on top of the black one (I. reind.-L.). Snow blindness may also be avoided if the eyes are not washed between February and Midsummer (I. fisher-L.), or if the lower eyelid is covered with soot (E.). The Utsjoki-Lapps used alum water. 1 ANDELIN, Oulun Lehti, 1881, n:o 1. -- A few drops of mother's milk are dripped into a sore eye, after which it is covered with a woolen cloth and blown upon. Another method is to throw cold water in the patient's eyes unexpectedly, e.g. when he opens a door (U.). If the disease of the eyes is due to cold, they should be rubbed with the water obtained by boiling white, black and red stones. 2 ANDELIN, Oulun Lehti, 1881, n:o 1. A kind of cataract ( ts√¢lmi l anst√¢rduvveh ) may form in the eyes in clear spring weather. When the patient enters a smoky hut, the cataract will break as a result of the flow of tears, and it is licked away (I. reind.-L.). The real cataract ( sm√§i'ti ) is healed by boiling birchashes in water. When the dregs have settled a pin is dipped into the surface layer (= lye) and one drop is let fall on the cataract. A minute amount of mercury has the same effect (U.). Formerly a louse was placed in the eye; it was believed to wear out the cataract when it moved. 3 Oulun W.-S. 1857, n:o 34. Tobacco-spittle may also be put in an eye afflicted with a cataract. 1 OINONEN, Kolmen valtaku nan ota-Lappia, p. 169. If the eye was injured while looking at a solar eclipse, it was healed by looking into a well or a copper kettle in moonlight, where the reflected image of the moon was shining. 2 PAULAHARJU, Taka-Lappia, p. 164. Some Lapps suffer from night blindness . The Kolt-Lapps believe that this is due to the fact that newborn children are brought at once close to the dazzling hearth. 3 Idem. Kolttain mailta, p. 175. A bit of dirt in the eye is taken away by blinking the eye in lukewarm water.

It is not difficult to understand that thunder and lightning, which sometimes kills men and animals, sets fire to trees and splits mountains, in these respects must be regarded as a malevolent being. But on the other hand the thunder which is followed by the fertilizing rain, important for the growth of grass and reindeer-moss, and purifies the heavy and oppressive atmosphere, from these points view appears also as a being benevolent to mankind. He expels the bad spirits or trolls which according to primitive belief fill the air and cause sickness. All the Samek seem to have agreed on this point. According to Leem there was a saying among the Norwegian Lapps that ‚Äúif there were no thunder the trolls would ruin the world‚Äù. They also said that during a thunderstorm the trolls were seen running about in the forest for fear until they found a hollow tree, where they tried to conceal themselves; but the tree was thereupon set on fire by the lightning 15 14 Fellman, I, 599. . The Russian ethnologist Charuzin, who in the first place gives us information about the ideas of the Russian Lapps, tells us much the same about them as Leem, Rheen, H√∂gstr√∂m and Fellman do about those of the Scandinavian and Finnish Lapps. ‚ÄúThunder is‚Äù, says Charuzin, ‚Äúboth a good and a bad god; he is good because he persecutes the evil wizards in whom a bad power is concealed.‚Äù Aijeke is honoured by the Lapps, he continues, because, as they relate, he has in his hands power over the life and death, the good and ill health of men. He pursues the evil spirits who are ill-disposed to the Lapps, shooting his arrows at them where they live in the rocks and mountains, or in the depths of the lakes. The Lapps have recourse to him when they believe that wizards have bewitched their reindeer herds, in order to revenge themselves. Aijeke pursues the evil-doer; sometimes he finds the wizard and then he kills him. Aijeke dwells in the air, he hears the utterances of men even when the Lapps believe that he will not hear them. He punishes them for their crimes. In addition to the belief that the thunder itself is a divinity, we find even among the Russian Lapps the idea that the peals during a thunderstorm are due to the arrows which the god of thunder shoots against the wizards 16 15 Leem, 506. .',\n",

Later on Rotaimo or Jabmeaimo, developed under the influence of Christian ideas, into the hell of the Lapps, and Rota or Rutu himself became an evil, tormenting god, a devil. In spite of this the Lapps in some cases, when no help was to be expected from other gods, were wont to offer sacrifices to this devil, the sacrifice always consisting of a horse 82 81 Itkonen, Heidnische Religion , 71-115. . Not only the sacrificial animal but also the way of performing the sacrifice was peculiar. According to Sidenius the victim had to be buried in the earth in order that Rutu might ride away and down into the underworld on the horse.

Different illnesses of course are believed to have somewhat different causes according to their symptoms. The most common explanation given of illnesses, the cause of which appeared mysterious, among the Lapps was the same as among other Finno-Ugrian peoples: they were believed to be sent by their own relatives who wished to take the survivors with them to the realm of the dead. The departed in the Hades of the Lapps, and the female ruler over it, who in the more developed Norwegian mythology is called Jabmeakka, generally were anxious to make their surviving relatives follow them there, either as a punishment or merely because they were longing for their company. Now if someone fell ill with a serious malady, the Lapps presumed that the soul of the patient had gone alone to the abode of the dead, and if the soul could not quickly be released and brought back, the body also would soon follow it. What the noidi had to do in such a case was to make a journey to the under-world for the purpose of liberating the soul by placating the departed with conjurations, prayers, and offerings. It was during this dangerous journey that he, among other things, needed the help of the saivo-guelle , the mysterious fish or snake the mission of which it was to protect him and help him to reach his destination. If, assisted by his tutelary spirit, he succeeded in bringing back the errant soul to the earth and reuniting it with the body, the patient was considered cured.

Bleeding and scarification are common practices of purely magical significance among all Indians of South America, and as far as the Pilcomayo tribes are concerned I shall have occasion to mention this custom again in a later chapter.

Rheumatic pains, especially during the dry season, are very common, and both young and old people suffer from them. As we know, they usually come on very suddenly, and even civilized peoples still use expressions like fairy-dart,  Hexenschuss , etc. of such sudden ailments. Beliefs of this kind are held both by the Choroti and by the other Chaco Indians. The Indians have very concrete ideas as to the way in which the sorcerers and the demons who serve them operate. The mysterious pain suddenly afflicting a man is explained as due to an arrow shot by an evil spirit. The Choroti accordingly call this disease-demon mohsek ihitek, i.e. the arrow-shooting demon, and this is an idea which is quite common among the South American Indians in general. The expression seems to indicate that at least in some cases an evil spirit is supposed to operate alone. As a rule, however, he is sent by a human sorcerer. I have already mentioned that the arrow or splinter, discharged by the sorcerer or his assistant demon, is generally a small stone, a cactus thorn, a piece of bone, or a small insect (for instance a worm or a beetle). I have also stated that this seemingly insignificant material object is identical with a mysterious demonical being whom the medicine-man, in curing the patient, tries to extract from his body. The object is sent by a mohsek, or in a certain sense is a mohsek . Generally, however, the Choroti call the mysterious intruder by another name: sometimes it is called nihl√©le, in other cases again pin√≠, words which have their equivalents in the Mataco and the Toba languages in the terms al√°h and kaip√°k respectively. In regard to all these words we have to remember that they belong to the particular mystical terminology of the sorcerers and cannot exactly be translated into any civilized language. The Indian arrow or splinter is half an inanimate object, half a live being, half material, half spiritual, half natural, half supernatural. Whatever it is, it is to the primitive mind the most real thing possible, because its existence is manifested by its dreadful effects.',\n",

This Indian view is especially conspicuous in regard to an operation which the whites sometimes perform upon Indians who have come in contact with European civilization, namely, vaccination. I could myself appreciate the extraordinary importance ascribed to scars when during my stay at Esperanza I vaccinated a number of Chaco Indians who were employed as labourers at the sugar factory.

Speaking of the dress of the Choroti, I mentioned the large and costly kind of necklace consisting of snail‚Äôs shells elaborately fashioned into small round buttons with a hole drilled in the centre and closely strung together. The necklace, called l√§hslehu√©sle in the Choroti language, is not only an ornament but at the same time a magical charm. The Choroti no doubt gave me the true explanation of their original significance when they told me that the necklace is a protection against sickness. The evil spirits, according to the idea of these Indians, preferably attach themselves to the throat or the chest, because catarrhs are very common in the Chaco during the dry season. The spirits are believed to enter into the body through the throat or the breast, but this is prevented by the protecting necklace. Hence, when a Choroti Indian sells his necklace or leaves off wearing it, his comrades say that he will most certainly soon fall ill. The same idea I found prevailing among the Mataco-Noct√©nes of Bolivia, where such ornaments are worn by both sexes. Thus the son of a chief, who was just at the age of puberty, one day appeared painted red in the face with uruc√∫, and with a large necklace which covered the neck and the breast. When I asked the father why his son had put on these things, he answered: It is in order that he may not fall ill. Both among the Mataco and the Choroti it is customary that children of both sexes go totally naked up to the age of eight to ten years, but nearly always they wear collars and facial paintings which most certainly are not ornaments in the civilized sense of the word.',\n",

Unlike the hall, the grave is a place to which all manner of spirits, including kui (ghosts) who are not ancestors, have access. * Kui is a term used generally for all the souls of the dead. Ancestors, those dead to whom one is obligated as a kinsman, are usually referred to by a more polite term, commonly co-kong , but if pressed most informants will concede that co-kong are kui , albeit more approachable and better known than the kui of dead strangers. ‚ÄúAt the hall only the ancestor comes to eat, though he might bring along a friend; it is like the feast that the living have after the offerings. But at the grave there might be flocks of ghosts around trying to eat the offerings we make to our ancestor.‚Äù Accordingly, many of the activities at the grave are directed against any uninvited ghosts who might be on hand. To ensure that the ancestor receives the offerings made to him, for example, the smoldering ashes of the paper money burnt for him are doused with a cup of wine to ‚Äúmark‚Äù this and all the rest of the offerings as his alone and to prevent other ghosts from taking them. The living who are present also need to be protected. The most common measure taken to this end is to pass out red steamed cakes to everyone who comes to the grave, the red color acting as a prophylactic to ward off any danger from lingering contact with ghosts. Another common precaution is to warn children against urinating anywhere near a grave. Everyone knew what had befallen one small boy who had urinated at a grave near Ch'inan. A ghost who happened to be at that spot had thereupon followed the boy home and had plagued him with illness until the child was exorcised of his tormentor by a god.\",\n",

From about April of 1902, the cult overran Miao-Li , Tung-Shih , Chang-Hwa Lu-Kang , Pei-T'ou , Pei-Kang , etc. By mid-June it had penetrated to the area of the north of Tainan, i.e. Chia-Yi . Officials earnestly discussed measures to stem the tide, but there was no easy way to do this. By the end of July the cult had reached as far as Ma-Tou (near Tainan). At this time the police office in Ma-Tou forbid the spirit writing cult to meet. By making the utmost efforts, the officials were able to dampen the movement a little. From then on the southern penetration of the cult began to slacken. It was not until August or September that the cult reached the southern end of the island. When it entered the Heng-Chun district, its fury was visibly less, and the bad effects comparatively lighter. But in the Pescadores, a strong impulse emanated from the Tainan area. Gaining the endorsement of several sympathizers, the cult was established in the temples of the fortress of MaKung. On the basis of its reputation for curing opium addicts, a great number of addicts assembled there and before the gods made a vow to quit the habit. Daily the number of pilgrims grew more numerous, but suppression was so effective that by the end of August 1902, the cult had practically ceased activity.

In Hsin-chu itself, this event is regarded as a pho-to (exorcism) and focuses on the grave containing the bones of those Hakka slain in their efforts to support imperial troops against the forces of the rebel Lin Shuang-wen in 1786-88 (Michael Moser, personal communication). For example, when I asked why a raw pig and raw fowl were offered to Co Su Kong, who is known to be a vegetarian, I was often told that Co Su Kong accepts the raw meat, cooks it, and distributes it to the hungry ghosts. One man said that the raw fowl is for the hungry ghosts and that the Ti Kong is for the ‚Äúmountain spirits‚Äù who are also the soldiers of Co Su Kong.

While the skeptic is thus forced by them to call upon the shaman, the traditionalists are likewise forced to call upon Western medicine when traditional methods have failed. As we saw in the case of the baby girl who died, the village did not feel that calling even upon two shamans was a clear indication that the family wanted the child to live; it was strongly felt that a Western doctor should have been called in as well. The general disapproval is not simply an example of the increased faith in Western medicine, but a reflection of a total attitude toward the control of unknown and powerful forces.

The only relevant fact seemed to them to be the yin body is in exactly the same condition as the yang body. There are several different ways one might describe the relationship between these two entities. One could simply call them two different bodies and leave it at that. However, this way of speaking may tempt us to miss the extent to which the two bodies are interdependent -- whatever happens to one happens to the other. Somewhat differently one could speak of the yin body as a symbolic representation of the yang body. But this seems to imply that the yin body is causally dependent on the yang body such that the yang body's condition initiates changes in it. As we have seen, the villagers were unwilling to agree with this proposition. One fruitful way of describing the relationship between the two entities is to speak of two parts of the same body -- yang and yin -- rather than either of the two alternatives above. If this is the way people see the relationship between the yang and yin components of the body they would be likely to believe that both the yang portion of the body and the yin house and tree must be in good repair in order for good health to prevail. This is in fact one thing that motivates people to take trips to look at underworld houses and trees. If simpler efforts fail to restore health, one can travel to a part of the body that is more directly alterable than the yang half; alteration of that part of the body is believed to entail alteration of the yang half of the body.\",\n",

Because many drugs are openly available in Taiwan which are sold only on prescription in the West, many Taiwanese readily use medicine more powerful than is usual in, say, the United States. Further, since instructions are normally not in Chinese or are not read (or both), there is a generally poor relation between drug and complaint. Doctors vary widely in licensing and quality, and rural people do not differentiate very precisely between a ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù trained for two months in the 1930s and one with a degree from an American or Japanese medical school trained in the 1960s. In general, doctors are perceived as people who give shots, and a session with a doctor which does not involve getting a shot is thought by many to be wasted money. Typically, the doctor's fee is based on his sale of medicine or a shot to the patient, and this may in certain cases also influence diagnosis and treatment. Impressive progress has been made and is being made in medical services in Taiwan, but it would be wrong to suppose that the presence or use of Western-style medical products implies either a standard of medical service or level and direction of popular knowledge comparable with that in the homelands of these products.

In the cases with which I am familiar she strikes misfortune upon her natal family or the families of her married sisters. This usually takes the form of sickness of one or more family members.

The most common oracle to which problems of spirit marriage are put is the female medium of a so-called Little God 6 The term ‚Äúlittle god‚Äù is used to refer to the divinized spirits of local people, whose oracles are consulted primarily by women for information on the rearing of children and other of the family's affairs that are entirely or largely under the government of women. We shall have more to say of them later on. in Chiali. This particular god's t√¢ng-ki specializes in spirit marriages and has a stock of equipment for their performance which can be rented by the day. Therefore, in deciding to consult the Little God, an individual or a family is fairly clearly anticipating a spirit marriage, and it will be one of my assumptions in what follows that a spirit marriage is initiated by the family involved.\",\n",

The story goes this way: Guo Ching has a son who lives in Taitung and who is already married. I have heard that this boy had struck up with a girl in Taitung who already had a husband, so her husband divorced her. Although the girl's husband had already divorced her, her husband's mother became very angry, and as a result fell sick and died. Before this old mother died, she was particularly angry with Guo Ching's boy because the latter had damaged their family. For this reason she used some superstitious method (the kind of [Taiwanese aboriginal] wizardry you photographed when you were in Taitung) to wound Guo Ching's son's wife. The objective was to cause his wife to become sick and die so that Guo Ching's son wouldn't have a wife. Not long afterward Guo Ching's son's wife took sick (a neurosis like the one Guo Tong-ming died of). Guo Ching's boy saw that his wife had already developed a neurosis and was terrified, so two weeks ago he sent his wife back to our village. After this woman got to our village, she upset the family every day, and struck people. So Guo Ching's family had three gods come down. Two [ t√¢ng-ki ] were from our village: Guo Tian-huah [Third Prince] and Guo Ching-shoei [the Great Saint], and one t√¢ng-ki from another village. I hear that these three gods used very peaceful means in taking care of this matter to implore the ghost who was bothering the woman's body to leave. Finally the three gods used impolite words and told the ghost who was bothering the woman's body that if she didn't leave, the three of them would be impolite to her. At length the ghost left, and the three gods [left and their t√¢ng-ki ] sat down to rest. After the three t√¢ng-ki had stopped, they had some refreshments, and when they had finished their refreshments the three left together to go home. But...they had only just arrived at the pond behind Guo Ching's house (for it was the road beside the village pond) when the ghost, who had been standing there waiting for them, struck the Third Prince's t√¢ng-ki, Guo Tian-huah. Tian-huah was knocked to the ground by her, but just as the ghost was about to strike the other two t√¢ng-ki their two gods possessed them, so they began to fight vigorously with the ghost. The two t√¢ng-ki fought very boisterously [ Rehnaw ], sometimes chasing into the trees, sometimes onto a roof, sometimes chasing her through the fishpond. Finally that invisible ghost lost the fight and ran away.\",\n",

I found her, as do many of her neighbors, an excellent informant on ancient home remedies, rituals for placating household gods and ghosts, techniques for protecting pregnant women, and for purifying rooms following childbirth. Part of her conflict with her late husband's younger brother, Lim Chieng-cua, results from his introduction of more economical practices in the ceremonies honoring the ancestors. Many families on Taiwan now combine the ceremonies celebrating their more distant ancestors' birth and death days, presenting the expensive offerings of meat and fowl to them all on the same day, rather than repeating the expense for each on their specific anniversary. Besides this, Lim Chieng-cua also abolished the bi-monthly offerings to Tu Ti Kung--a less expensive ceremony but one that has not been celebrated in many households for decades. A-pou bitterly resented these omissions and continued to offer an apologetic bit of incense each night and morning to preserve what to her was at least a semblance of propriety. When Lim Chieng-cua installed the new pump in the house without consulting the almanac, A-pou was angry for days. According to the almanac, the Placenta God was resting in that particular room on that particular day. Through Lim Chieng-cua's negligence, the little god was disturbed or injured, and he took his vengeance on A-pou's grandson in the form of a high fever. Before the fever was finally controlled with an injection of penicillin, Lim Chieng-cua and his nephew, the father of the child, had to endure a week of foul humor, both of them alarmed by the illness and neither of them believing in A-pou's theory of causation.\",\n",

When a patient is being treated, kin and neighbours come to attend. The drumming wakens the disease in all of them who have been ill of it before and they too will join in the violent dance of the sufferer.

He or she may cause good or ill fortune to befall the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, ‚Äúwho are known to it,‚Äù but his power is not limited by distance, since any royal grave can afflict any member of the royal line anywhere, cause misfortune to the whole of Loziland, or trouble any Lozi, even in White country, if it knows of him and his ancestors, especially if he is a member of the political sector attached to the royal grave. Each grave has its resident priests, appointed by the king in council. The priests make national offerings at the king's orders, and the cult is under his control. Individuals make offerings through the priests and if a spirit has been particularly troublesome the king himself may make offerings to it, through the mediation of the priests.

The royal ancestors are sometimes entreated to intercede with Nyambe to restore someone to health and sometimes they are themselves regarded as the cause of disease.

Simply to look at the lists and prescriptions is to gain two impressions. Firstly, they would not have been recoverably in this form if much of it had not worked; secondly, with no notion of dosage, the risk of failure even if the active principle was right was thereby increased. 71 I own this point to Dr A. de Vente. I own this point to Dr A. de Vente. But here, as in those cases for which the prescription was wrong, there was a sequential series of blocks to falsifiability: if the specific treatment failed, this would be a sign that the affliction was not simple and it therefore required specialist treatment. If the healer's specifics failed, this was a sign of evil interference which had to be identified by divination, and in this way a structural block could be invoked, even if the patient died. Thus a difficult case would move along one axis of the table from individual to communal and the other from symptomatic to non-symptomatic treatment, hence diagonally. The line could be extended off the table since for affliction beyond the norm, such as the early 1890s smallpox epidemic, recourse could only be through appeal to the unseen powers and there divinatory practice merged with the other functions of the royal graves.\",\n",

He sang like a bird and his victims were drawn irresistibly to the sound. Once he appeared before them, they were lost, for like his human brothers the baloi (witches), Mwendanjangula enslaved their spirits. The symptoms of possession by muba might be high fever and loss of consciousness during the time that the spirit was being dragged forth to act for its master. 74 Informants all over Bulozi, 1974 and 1975; Jacottet, √âtudes , Subiya version vol. ii , pp. 138-9 (‚ÄòSikulobuzuka‚Äô); vol. iii , pp. 120-1 (‚ÄòMuenda ndjongola‚Äô); pp. 133-5, (‚ÄòNjangwa-muloti‚Äô).

This name was expected to protect its bearer from all kinds of diseases that were brought about by the evil spirits.

In damp and marshy places, among lakes, where the population feeds primarily on the poorest kinds of fish, leprosy is found, although by no means to such an extent as has been proclaimed. The point is that the inhabitants confuse this disea se with some forms of chronic syphilis, which manifests itself in this severe climate with fearsome severity: the body and the bones rot away, and the sick man decomposes while he is still alive, just as he does from leprosy. The inhabitants have a great fear of both these disease and, as soon as they develop, banish the sick one mercilessly: they put the syphilitics into the okrug hospitals, and drive those suspected of leprosy into the woods, where they have houses built for them and where they bring the m food at definite intervals. When such a colony dies off, the Yakut burn down the buildings with everything that is inside them. 1 Their fear of infection reaches such apoint that they avoid speaking to the sick or approaching them, even at a distance of several sagenes. They consider that the fish of a lake where lepers have fished are also leprous, and once when I gathered some cloudberries growing not far from the ashes of a colony of lepers, long since destroyed, the Yakut, learning of this, considered that I was a doomed man (Kolymsk Ulus, Engzha, 1883). Another time, when on the road to Kolymsk on the Indigirka I and my Cossack fellow-traveler, lagging behind the caravan, got lost in a snowstorm and accidentally stumbled on such a house, my young fellow-traveler, learning that lepers lived there, jumped up like a madman and ran, literally at a gallop, far beyond the confines of the enclosure, without waiting for me or asking the direction. The lepers themselves, who met us very timidly, went out into the yard and shouted dierctions to us from afar. They call leprosy the big sickness (ulakhan olyu, and also syster), and call syphilis the Russian or French disease. The worst of the epidemic diseases for the Yakut is smallpox.

Rheumatism is extremely widespread; finally, the terrible disease, contraction of the throat, is not a rarity; its victims die a death from hunger. This malady is apparently found most often in those places where cattle raising is the exclusive occupation, where the supply of wild animals has been exhausted and they do not raise grain; I think it appears as a result of eating liquid foods exclusively. Besides this, it is a rare Yakut who does not suffer from tape-worm or round worm - a result of eating meat that is raw or not sufficiently cooked; the local cattle suffer equally severely from these parasites. From the observations of doctors, diseases and medicines alike act more quickly on the organisms of Yakut, than on Russians. Yakut live to a ripe old age: old men of seventy or eighty are far from rare among them.',\n",

       "  'passage': \"322 In the way of meat the first place among the Yakut according to the number of poods consumed is occupied at the present time by beef. Mare's meat is more highly valued by the Yakut, it cost more, and is inaccessible to the poor. Even average households are not able to feast themselves on it very often. Less of it is used in general. - This is the food of rich men and horse thieves, says, not without foundation, a proverb. But on rare occasions even the poor manage to get hold of this meat, in the form of payment for work done, for hay, and so forth. In some localities the rich are very willing to settle accounts with slaughtered mares or two year old colts. Again, at weddings, even when the parties are not rich, the Yakut always slaughter horses and all the meat is eaten on the spot or taken home by the guests. The Yakut distinguish nine stages of corpulence in their horses and three stages of emaciation. They consider meat from a horse in the last stage of emaciation, yrbyt, injurious to the health. Matiushkin, who traveled with Vrangel, describes how when after many days of hungry wandering he offered to kill one of the horses, the Yakut, although famished and driven to desperation, refused: No, our horses are exhausted, covered with boils and wounds; their blood is inflamed and we will become ill if we start to eat their meat, - they replied. 1 Vrangel'. Vol. II, p. 267. I have myself heard these arguments more than once. Nevertheless in the Kolymsk Okrug in 1882, when great numbers of dead horses died along the road because of bad fodder, I saw whole caravans, of up to ten narts, of disgusting looking carrion with ragged skin and no meat at all. These dead horses were being carried to post stations, from where they were sold at a cheap price to poor Yakut. In general the Yakut do not scorn eating carrion and even rich men, using the pretext of opoy , uruttabyt , will not miss a chance to eat a dead mare or a cow, as long as it is fat. Opoy (heart failure) for some reason is not considered a dishonorable death. The Yakut are also willing to eat cattle which has died from malignant anthrax; they have even worked out a whole system of treating such horses. The sick horses are killed, which is something the Yakut always try to do with any hopelessly sick cattle; in no case, however, do they use the blood as food. Then the meat is quartered and hung up, to let it cool off and dry from any remnants of blood. Before eating it they boil it thoroughly, contrary to their usual practice with meat. The intestines and the fat are not eaten. They dress the cattle while wearing mittens and do all sorts of things so as not to get the disease themselves; nevertheless each year in the Yakutsk Oblast several families die from malignant anthrax. Often they fail to recognize this disease, and tempted by the sight of the fat meat attribute the cattle's death to the all-excusing heart failure\",\n",

They consist 637 of frightening or coaxing out the unwelcome guests. The simplest method is the fire cure. It is only used for treating certain illnesses, such as: swellings, broken bones, rheumatic pains, and malignant wounds. In the Kolymsk Okrug I saw a characteristic scene: a lad had accidentally bruised his finger. It was aching and an abcess had developed. He had however come to the conclusion, as did all his associates, that an er had settled in his finger. Wishing to drive him out the sick one took a hot coal and began to blow on it holding it next to his wound; when the burned skin began to blister and then broke with a slight cracking sound, the curious onlookers, gathered around in a circle, jumped back with a cry of fright, and the sick lad, smiling with self-satisfaction, said: See how he jumped out! The use of fire as a method of healing is very widespread among the Yakut, particularly in the north. In Verkhoyansk I saw an old man who suffered from shifting rheumatism; his body was literally eaten out with deep burns. He treated his illness in the following fashion: as soon as pain or swelling would appear he would immediately put a piece of lighted tinder or rag on the affected spot, and then wait patiently for the whole piece to burn. A choking smell of burning cloth and human flesh would permeate the hut, and the old man would sit, his head downcast, and merely moan quietly and pitifully from time to time. No arguments could convince him of the uselessness of the treatment he was employing; the Yakut ironically call this method the Yakut blister.',\n",

He had many children, seven, I believe, and one white bull on which his children rode when visiting neighbors, itimni. It happened that someone stole his bull and thus made it impossible for him to move about with his children. The children began to get sick and cry from hunger, and drove the old man to such a point that he dug a pit, put the children in it, and lit a fire over them. When the children began to choke and die he struck his tambourine and, walking around the fire, began to perform a shamanistic rite and utter his grieviances against mankind.

The Yakut consider a devil to be the cause of everything, for instance: if a person or head of cattle falls ill, or calves die, they day that a devil is torturing and killing them, without any understanding of the fact that all this has natural causes; healing through shamanism, which includes shouting over sore eyes, spitting on the sick part of the body, which is done not by a shaman but by ordinary Yakut and which sometimes succeeds, comes from sympathetic actions; 2) to repel cattle infection and especially the death of calves; 3) for entertainment, for in such cases the shamans do tricks and make prophesies; 4) for the delirious; because of great faith in shamanism, this illness formerly existed everywhere among the Yakut, especially among females, who can be stopped only by means of shamanism and otherwise continue to suffer. This custom, i.e., shamanism, has gradually almost died out since the Yakut adopted the Christian faith, and now most of the Yakut, enlightened by faith and the knowledge of the truth, recognize it as ignorance and superstition; however, many even of the converted Yakut, having bee brought up in the belief, practise it, but the Yakut do not consider this reprehensible, owing to the antiquity of the custom, and therefore no 219 strict measures are taken in this connection, the more so since: 1) the Yakut who practise shamanism do not forget that God exists and know that everything is done through His Almighty Power, for they have long become accustomed to saying, when a person dies, ‚ÄúHe has gone to God‚Äù, without distinguishing whether the person was righteous or sinful; circumstances which favor them have God's help, and likewise events which hinder them and accidents are recognized as God's punishment for sins; 2) if shamans were given strict punishment, then it would be necessary to punish their spectators as well, for they induced them to shamanize and came mainly to eat the sacrificed livestock; there are four or five people every time, from which it follows that very few would go unpunished, investigations and denunciations would multiply so that there would be no business but cases about shamanism, with resultant neglect to useful domestic occupations. The Yakut are using the following means to destroy this custom gradually: a) all converted Yakut are strictly forbidden by the clan-chiefs to shamanize and to have shamanism performed. In case of conviction of this offence, the guilty shaman is deprived of the clothing and objects which he uses for shamanism, they are destroyed, and the shaman's hair is shaved off, as a sign of his calling; and those who caused him to perform are given reprimands in meetings of the communities; b) among the unconverted, a shaman who was supposed to heal a patient but who did not succeed must turn over the head of cattle which was sacrificed and pay all losses incurred by the patient; but if he is convicted of this several times, he is declared an impostor and becomes a permanent object of mockery and is quite without employment. As this custom is repugnant to the Christian religion, 220 the Yakut themselves, and frequently the eparchial priests have sent denunciations to the authorities because of particular complaints among the Yakut, there have been investigations by the zemstvo officials, and the guilty parties have given themselves up to the disposition of the discretionary court which caused the Yakut, and especially those who were affected by the action, much losses and distractions from their occupations.\",\n",

Krogman 313 Krogman, 1939, p. 12; Ronhaar, 1930, passim . Without having examined the physical evidence which might prove this contention, I believe on other evidence (such as the frequent and severe migraine of the Aymara) that a very plausible case might be made also for the alternative purpose. There is every reason to believe, however, that both motives could have operated. In this connection it is interesting to recall the legend, reported by Vara Cadillo, of the Ichik Ol'qo or child-demon, which inhabits waterfalls and foundtains, growling angrily, and throwing out a rainbow from his navel, by which he exerts an evil influence upon men through the crowns of their heads. Note also the Aymara belief in a vampire-head which sucks blood from the occipital region. considers that the purpose of trephining was to relieve compression fractures of the skull caused by warclubs, but Ronhaar believes that trephining was performed most often for epilepsy or migraine (if the epilepsy were traumatic, it comes to the same thing).

The theory of this Aymara science is that various internal organs, particularly the heart ( c'uimia ), may become physically dislocated kiucxata . By massaging the arms and the torso carefully, and by binding with a wide textile girdle, the visceral dislocations of the patient are reduced, and he is cured. In the t'alanta procedure previously mentioned the patient is also sometimes tossed gently in a poncho held by serveral people, until his organs return to their proper position. The processes of truq'aq'a and p'ic'aq'a involve rubbing certain substances upon the body of the sick person, but with a different motive: to absorb the evil spirit which has entered, so that it may be tempted away by libations and sacrifices. A similar practice is lumaq'a , or ‚Äúpurification.‚Äù Some diseases like tertian fever can be cured by frightening the patient severely, for then the evil spirit will abandon his body. One of the fevers, which has the appearance of a skeleton-thin woman with disheveled hair, can be so cured. Tuberculosis, however, which is caused by tall, thin, frozen beings who live by drinking the blood of their victims, is not cured in this way. Typhoid fever can be sidetracked by cutting open a black chicken and placing it on the stomach of the sick person, or by placing his legs in the stomach of a dead dog, or by putting black guineapigs on his body immediately after eviscerating them. The disease of culpa-usu , which is caused by the ‚Äúpenetration‚Äù of a bone from the tomb into the body of the victim, can of course only be cured by the removal of the foreign body itself.\",\n",

As he climbed out, first he and then others around the grave threw earth into the grave on top of the coffin. The paqo or man in charge of the ceremonies said a few worde of prayer before the grave was shoveled full. A mound formed by the earth displaced by the coffin was smoothed off over the grave and a crude wooden cross stuck into it.

In addition, coca and alcohol were placed on top of the grave, to be rescued later in the day for general consumption. Nothing was buried with the corpse, but people recognize that in the past household and other items were buried, too. They know this because they run into old graves during their construction work. Tschopik notes the practice in Chucuito of the widow putting a stone inside her blouse near her heart.

Aymara magicians frequently claim that they had been struck by lightning and thus knew that they had been singled out by the spirits to become magicians. Quintin, a Capilaya magician, attributed his decision to become a magician to a prolonged illness. He became a maestro when he was well in his forties. He had been living in La Paz for ten years and had become ill. After entering a hospital his health improved somewhat. Soon afterwards his compadre , a maestro who could ‚Äúread the coca‚Äù revealed to him that his illness was caused by supernatural forces, a sign that he should become a maestro , too. Quintin then returned to Compi and asked a yatiri from Jank'o Amaya to help him request the Achachila of Kakape, a Compi mountain, to give him permission to practice magic. During part of the trip up the hill Quintin rode on a donkey, still feeling too weak from his illness to walk; halfway up he suddenly felt better and was able to proceed on foot. He claims that from that moment on there has been no illness in his family. On top of Kakape the initiation took place with a sacrifice to the mountain's achachila . Later the wife of another yatiri suggested that Quintin affirm his position as maestro by making a pilgrimage to Oje, a community whose patron saint, an image of Saint Peter, is considered to be endowed with miraculous powers. Favorable circumstances, however, elevated Quintin to the position of section magician that very same year and thus the trip to Oje became unnecessary. In previous years there had been no magicians in Capilaya. Feliciano, a Compeno who was at the same time sot'a , or chief aide to the mayordome of the hacienda, an administrator hated in the community because of the unpopular measures he had introduced in Compi to gain the favor of the patr√≥n, acted as magician of both Compi proper and Capilaya. The year Quintin became a magician the harvest in Capilaya had been bad because hail had fallen in that section alone, sparing the rest of the hacienda. This was attributed to Feliciano's disinterest in a section to which he did not belong. Thus the Capilaya colonos asked Quintin to direct the important hail ceremonies. According to the magician, the crops produced abundantly again during subsequent years forcing even the patr√≥n to recognize him as section magician in spite of the intrigues of Feliciano.\",\n",

Saint Peter may be called upon like any powerful mountain spirit to bestow magical powers on an individual. The fact that Quintin's health improved in the hospital did not lead him to doubt his compadre's verdict that supernatural forces had brought about his illness. Quintin's story also exemplifies both section rivalries and the relationship with overseers appointed by the patr√≥n. Capilaya considered itself to be at a disadvantage vis-√†-vis other sections because it did not have its own magician.

The yatiri , or curer, should be called in such a situation in order to recall the animo , 4 According to other yatiri the ayayu , a second soul, is the soul which is lost. The third soul is a person's coraje , (or ‚Äúcourage‚Äù). one of the three souls a person possesses. This is accomplished in the following manner. A piece of the patient's clothing is laid on the ground, a short distance from the patient's house by the maestro . He is accompanied by at least one friend or a relative of the patient. Near the patient's clothing is put the contents of llama entrails, gall stones diluted in holy water in a little cup, with St. Nicholas bread (a sort of wafer with the image of St. Nicholas) and chinchi chinchi (unidentified fruit). Then they both retreat to the house. After this, the curer calls to and libates the animo with alcohol. In the meantime, the patient is supposed to sleep in order for the soul to reenter its abode. (Sleep may be considered an intermediary between life and death.) While waiting for the soul's return during the patient's sleep, other animos may appear. These are the animos of persons who will fall ill in the near future, and can be clearly identified. When the patient's animo arrives it has to be enveloped immediately in the clothing. They (the curer and his assistant) then place the clothing beside the patient, making him drink some of the holy water and wash his face. Then they put the clothing on the patient. During the process of calling the soul, wool spun in reverse is also used. One tears small pieces and throws them to the wind, calling the soul as one throws. The next day this wool is burned and the patient must drink the ashes mixed with water. Yarn spun in reverse is also placed in the patient's hands and on the ground around him so that the soul may not escape. If the patient does not recover, this may be due to complications with other spirits, such as a lake, or other achachila , or rayo (lightning or site where lightning has struck). A mesa (burnt offering) has to be given on the site where the person experienced a susto , or at the site where lightning has struck. However, susto may also be cured by natural herbal remedies such as a brew of thapi (unidentified), chinchi chinchi or chhojjlla (grass).\",\n",

When a person has a fever, he is washed all over with fermented human urine; Garcilaso (bk. ii, ch. XXIV) says that when a suckling was feverish, it was washed in urine in the morning, and if they could obtain some of the child's own urine, it was given to it to drink. As has already been mentioned, urine is also mixed with other substances, notably with the viscous pounded mass of the berries of some of the American mistletoes ( Phoradendron spp., Loranthaceae) as an ointment. When a glandular or goitrous swelling is adjudged to have come from contact with the spittle of a frog, the place is washed with tamata and salt. When a baby is sick, the milucana ceremony may be performed by the yatiri (one type of Aymara medicine-man). A piece of milu or alum is put on the child's chest and left there three or four hours until night. The yatiri then rubs the milu all over the little patient's body, after which he puts the stone into a large bowl of tamata . This is then covered with a lihla or other woollen cloth and left for twenty minutes to half an hour. When the bowl is uncovered, the milu is seen to have swelled up like a sponge (from the chemical action), usually into figures which the yatiri is able to study for his diagnosis. Then he says: ‚ÄúThis child was frightened at such-and-such a spring,‚Äù or ‚ÄúHe will get well,‚Äù or ‚ÄúHe will die.‚Äù When the augury is bad, he takes a knife, and cuts the spongy mass with appropriate exorcisms, makes a hole in the ground and buries it. This diagnostic technique is of course especially valuable for the ailments of children, who cannot be expected to verbalize about such abstruse matters with any fluency; the same technique, however, is also used in the case of adult ailments, when the cause of the disease baffles even the yatiri . Finally, urine has a therapeutic value in the apsuyasi√±a type of counter-witchcraft. In this the house of the sick man is carefully searched and sounded for hollow places with a weavingbatten, and when the place where the sickness is hiding is found, the camakani or camakiri (other kinds of Aymara medical practitioners) throws some of the sick man's urine on it together with salt, and sometimes with other substances. The sickness then enters the urine and salt, which is then gathered up and thrown into a river, or burnt at a cross-roads, where the next unfortunate passerby will become the ‚Äúhost‚Äù of the disease. Best of all is for the camakani to obtain by stealth some of the urine of the rival witch who is causing the disease. The sick man is bathed in this urine, which is then thrown surreptitiously outside the witch's door. In this way the witchcraft-induced disease ‚Äúcomes home to roost,‚Äù where it belongs.\",\n",

The olemunaci is often a ‚Äúpiedra iman‚Äù or magnet to attract (metal) money; hence it is also called auxactir ala (from Sp. aguja , ‚Äúneedle,‚Äù ‚Äúlift‚Äù and ala , ‚Äústone,‚Äù or ‚Äúneedle-lifting stone‚Äù). The Collawayus say that there are two kinds of magnet, male and female. The ‚Äúfemale‚Äù magnet has a smooth surface, the ‚Äúmale‚Äù is spiny and rough. The medicine-men both sell and use them themselves. In the south of the altiplano around Sicasica a compound amulet or ‚Äúbolsita‚Äù is placed around the neck of a child on a string. This may contain such articles as a small knife, rosary-beads, a small cross, a little salt, a small yellow chili, milu or alum, hawatikilu (a fruit pit), ki√±ulu (a root) a piece of a√±il or blue stone, etc.--to protect the child from sickness, falls, hurts, wounds, and ‚Äúbad luck‚Äù in general. While the child who wears one of these is sleeping, no ariari or ancancu (vampires or disease-producing demons) dare approach.',\n",

Other sources of error are likewise apparent, for the categories employed in the tabulations in no way reflect clear-cut entities. Thus disease, from the Aymara point of view, may be due to natural causes, to sorcery, or may be sent by demons or offended spirits, and the informant, in expressing his anxiety about illness, may not specify his conception of its source with clarity. Again, rain or its absence (an environmental consideration) may be the source of anxiety, but rainfall in turn is often believed to be affected by spirits or souls of the dead (supernaturals). Similarly, in certain cases of sorcery it is difficult to know whether the victim was more concerned about his health or the effect that impaired health would have upon his subsistence activities.

       "  'passage': \"It is unquestionably true that the Aymara deeply fear the dead and the circumstances surrounding death. Paredes' belief that these attitudes result from missionary teaching is almost certainly incorrect. 3 Paredes, 1936, 228-229. Far from being so uncomplicated, the explanation of this fear of the dead is complex, and several component beliefs must be considered independently. First, the corpse itself, as well as associated objects, is thought to be a potential source of a certain disease, orixa , to which children are particularly susceptible. Second, all ghosts of adults, irrespective of the dispositions of their former earthly counterparts, are naturally malevolent, and may send disease or, according to folk tales, cause death in other ways. 4 Informants were undecided as to whether or not children produced ghosts; at any rate, the ghosts of children (if they exist) are not feared (11, 43). Finally, the souls of the dead, either out of sheer jealousy of the living, or because of loneliness, frequently attempt to drag relatives and friends along with them to the hereafter. 1 As is shown below, it is close relatives who are most apt to be harmed by the dead. Similarly, it should be noted, in cases of sorcery the first suspicion of guilt falls upon close relatives. Indeed, as lias been demonstrated, the Aymara today is forced to compete for his very livelihood with his close relatives. It seems possible, therefore, to regard this fear of corpses, ghosts, and souls in part as a projection of repressed hostility towards parents and near relatives into the realm of the dead. This is especially true of the souls of children, and many omens are interpreted to mean that the deceased child desires the death of a sibling. 2 Perhaps this belief is to be understood as a projection of sibling rivalry, a phenomenon of which the Aymara themselves are well aware. There is, on the contrary, no evidence whatever from Chucuito to indicate that the dead ever seek to benefit the living (except to warn them of impending disaster) or that souls are regarded as guardians or protectors. 3 Paredes writes that the souls of the dead are believed to watch over and protect their relatives and the community as a whole; while they never abandon their kinsmen, these souls may punish the living if they deserve it. Paredes, 1946, 211-212. Indeed, the return of the souls during All Saints fiesta in November is believed to prevent rain when it is most meeded and the exposed bones of the dead are thought to cause drought (2). It is also desirable to slaughter livestock for meat before All Souls day, since the returning souls are said to steal the fat of these animals (43).\",\n",

Bandelier also mentions a disease, larpata , contracted by a child who has seen a corpse. Bandelier, 1910, 125, 342. While the corpse is prepared for burial and during the wake that follows, the children are kept out of sight, often shut up in the kitchen. So liable are children to injury by the dead, that a pregnant woman who has seen a corpse, handled human bones, or been near a cemetery or ruin, will almost certainly bear a child who is either sick with orixa or who is deformed (11, 64).',\n",

Paredes states flatly that ‚Äúwitches‚Äù directly, or demons acting at the behest of ‚Äúwitches,‚Äù are responsible for all diseases. 3 Paredes, 1936, 180-181. Taking a similar position, La Barre writes that disease is inevitably caused either by ‚Äúwitchcraft‚Äù or by evil spirits. 4 La Barre, 1948, 219-220. Either these views are over-simple, or the disease theory of the Bolivian Aymara is considerably less complex than is true of the Aymara of Peru. In Chucuito, as has been shown, some diseases are clearly due to sorcery, either directly or indirectly. Others, however, are sent by spirits of their own volition (because they have been angered or slighted), or by permanent and naturally malevolent demons. Still others are contracted from souls and ghosts. Some ailments stem from accidental soul loss, while in others soul kidnapping is the cause. Still others, chullpa sickness, for example, result from the intrusion of a foreign object, either through carelessness or through the evil machinations of humans or demons. In addition, some diseases are unquestionably attributed by the Aymara of Chucuito to natural causes. 5 At least, they are blamed neither upon malevolent supernaturals nor upon the evil intentions of other humana. Among these are various ailments that are (or are thought to be) attendant upon childbirth; fractures, sprains, and dislocations (including the ‚Äúdislocation‚Äù of internal organs); and such common and frequent complaints as p'eqe usu , ‚Äúheadache,‚Äù t'uku usu , ‚Äúcommon cold,‚Äù and c'aka usu , ‚Äúrheumatism.‚Äù\",\n",

Slightly convex and covered with decoration of a simple sort, this shield has a diameter of 30 to 60 centimeters, is brown in color (the smaller, very 28 common kind (Plate 12) is colored dark red), and is very durable. The Som√¢li often uses it as a parasol, especially when he is roaming idly through the treeless savanna. Usually, however, he keeps his shield in a cotton cover, and when on the march, he likes to hang it on his back. On his hip we find a sword-like bowie knife 45 to 65 centimeters long, with an iron cutting edge ( gulh√°t, sejf, or bila√∫a ) five centimeters wide usually, in a simple leather sheath. The handle is decorated with a tin covering and is made of wood or ivory. This knife is designed for defense in hand-to-hand fighting, but it is used for all the tasks in everyday life that require the use of a knife, especially woodworking, skinning animals, hut construction, and so forth. The Dan√¢kil manufacture especially attractive knives, beautifully hooked at the tip and unusually well decorated with a brass mounting. Many of these knives are to be found in √äjssa country. A small dagger or stiletto (m√≠ndi) is also used. The cutting edges are equal to the best European ones. In addition to the spear, everyone as a rule carries a powerful, long, club-like stick (√∫sa) . This is being adopted more and more, especially in the towns of Berbera and Zeila which have very recently barred the entry of Som√¢l with weapons in their hands. Furthermore, cudgels a meter in length and richly carved (w√™ger) are found on the coast. Two spears are carried by the men in the vicinity of the Galla region. No Som√¢li is seen without a spear, even when he is performing household tasks. When he walks, he usually carries it on the left shoulder or leans on it. The M√≠dgan carries a bow (g√°nso) and arrows (nis√¢b) . The bow is one and a half meters long and unadorned by carving or other decoration. The quiver (gub√¢jo), however, is adorned with an indented leather lid or leather tassels. The poison for the arrow (gedul√¢jo) is prepared from the roots of various poison trees, particularly the Cararo . It is deep black and adheres below the arrowhead (fil√¢r) . The poison acts rapidly, and the Som√¢l regard the falling out or shedding of hair as the first and most definite indication of the onset of complete poisoning. Members of the female sex carry no weapons. In battle, the spear is thrown only in the most extreme situations when one can then immediately hurl himself on the enemy with a knife. As a rule the Som√¢li carries out an attack by lying in ambush for the enemy and then knocking him down with the spear. The instrument of assassination otherwise is the bowie knife. The natives are not very skilled in the use of their weapons, especially the spears, which are thrown without verve. At the same time the men generally are experts at a series of spectacular juggling tricks with weapons.',\n",

Special priests (wodad√≠n) roam through the countryside, usually traveling through a region with a number of other priests, performing the functions of their office and lining their pockets in the process. They have no influence whatever on the people. Superstition flourishes in the most luxuriant forms, but I would say that even this has no significance whatever, because the natives content themselves entirely with copied amulets and the like. Belief in sorceresses ( kom√¢ju, sorceress) is to be encountered here and there since, after all, every old woman is surrounded by the aura of being able to perform sorcery. The Som√¢li swears an oath (d√¢r) on the Koran, and the Ogad√™n on the head of his children and wives. Breach of promise with respect to the Whites or the enemy, however, is no crime. The prayer times are those of all Islamites (9:30, s√∫bbeh; noon, d√≥hur; 3:30, √°ssur; 6:30, m√°grib; and eight o‚Äôclock, as√¢ ); they are observed only by the most pious. Attempts to convert the Som√¢l to the Christian religion have never been seriously undertaken. In Zeila, to be sure, a magnificent house has been built for the French Mission, but not in the hope of being able to win the Som√¢l for Christendom. The building is supposed to serve merely as a way station for missionaries going off to Galla country. The universal complaint is that the Som√¢li curtly turns away the European apostle of the faith and that, in view of the people‚Äôs nomadic way of life, the latter is unable to step in to civilize the natives by getting them in the habit of working regularly. None of the religious ideas of the Galla has been incorporated by the Som√¢l. Except to celebrate Ramadan there are no festive periods.

The situation is a low and level spit of sand, which high tides make almost an island. There is no harbour: a vessel of 250 tons cannot approach within a mile of the landing-place; the open roadstead is exposed to the terrible north wind, and when gales blow from the west and south, it is almost unapproachable. Every ebb leaves a sandy flat, extending half a mile seaward from the town; the reefy anchorage is difficult of entrance after sunset, and the coralline bottom renders wading painful. The shape of this once celebrated town is a tolerably regular parallelogram, of which the long sides run from east to west. The walls, without guns or embrasures, are built, like the houses, of coralline rubble and mud, in places dilapidated. There are five gates. The Bab el Sahil and the Bab el Jadd (a new postern) open upon the sea from the northern wall. At the Ashurbara, in the southern part of the enceinte, the Bedouins encamp, and above it the governor holds his Durbar. The Bab Abd el Kadir derives its name from a saint buried outside and eastward of the city, and the Bab el Saghir is pierced in the western wall. The public edifices are six mosques, including the Jami, or cathedral, for Friday prayer: these buildings have queer little crenelles on whitewashed walls, and a kind of elevated summer-house to represent the minaret. Near one of them are remains of a circular Turkish Munar, manifestly of modern construction. There is no Mahkamah or Kazi‚Äôs court: that dignitary transacts business at his own house, and the Festival prayers are recited near the Saint‚Äôs Tomb outside the eastern gate. The northeast angle of the town is occupied by a large graveyard with the usual deleterious consequences. The climate of Zayla is cooler than that of Aden, and, the site being open all around, it is not so unhealthy. Much spare room is enclosed by the town walls: evaporation and Nature‚Äôs scavengers act succedanea for sewerage. Zayla commands the adjacent harbour of Tajurrah, and is by position the northern port of Aussa (the ancient capital of Adel), of Harar, and of southern Abyssinia: the feuds of the rulers have, however, transferred the main trade to Berberah. It sends caravans northwards to the Dankali, and south-west-wards, through the Eesa and Gudabirsi tribes as far as Efat and Gurague. It is visited by Cafilas from Abyssinia, and the different races of Bedouins, extending from the hills to the seaboard. The exports are valuable‚Äîslaves, ivory, hides, honey, antelope horns, clarified butter, and gums: the coast abounds in sponge, coral, and small pearls, which Arab divers collect in the fair season. In the harbour I found about twenty native craft, large and small: of these, ten belonged to the governor. They trade with Berberah, Arabia, and Western India, and are navigated by ‚ÄúRajput‚Äù or Hindu pilots. Provisions at Zayla are cheap; a family of six persons live well for about 30 l. per annum. The general food is mutton: a large sheep costs one dollar, a small one half the price; camels; meat, beef, and in winter kid, abound. Fish is rare, and fowls are not commonly eaten. Holcus, when dear, sells at forty pounds per dollar, at seventy pounds when cheap. It is usually levigated with slab and roller, and made into sour cakes. Some, however, prefer the Arab form ‚Äúbalilah,‚Äù boiled and mixed with ghee. Wheat and rice are imported: the price varies from forty to sixty pounds the Riyal or dollar. Of the former grain the people make a sweet cake called Sabaya, resembling the Fatirah of Egypt: a favourite dish also is ‚Äúharisah‚Äù‚Äîflesh, rice flour, and boiled wheat, all finely pounded and mixed together. Milk is not procurable during the hot weather; after rain every house is full of it; the Bedouins bring it in skins and sell it for a nominal sum. Besides a large floating population, Zayla contains about 1500 souls. They are comparatively a fine race of people, and suffer from little but fever and an occasional ophthalmia. Their greatest hardship is the want of the pure element: the Hissi or well, is about four miles distant from the town, and all the pits within the walls supply brackish or bitter water, fit only for external use. This is probably the reason why vegetables are unknown, and why a horse, a mule, or even a dog, is not to be found in the place. to one of his substantial houses of coralline and mud plastered over with glaring whitewash. The ground floor is a kind of warehouse full of bales and boxes, scales and buyers. A flight of steep steps leads into a long room with shutters to exclude the light, floored with tamped earth, full of ‚Äúevening flyers‚Äù * ‚ÄúFid-mer,‚Äù or the evening flyer, is the Somali name for a bat. These little animals are not disturbed in houses, because they keep off flies and mosquitoes, the plagues of the Somali country. Flies abound in the very jungles wherever cows have been, and settle in swarms upon the traveller. Before the monsoon their bite is painful, especially that of the small green species; and there is a red variety called ‚ÄúDiksi as,‚Äù whose venom, according to the people, causes them to vomit. The latter abounds in Gulays and the hill ranges of the Berberah country: it is innocuous during the cold season. The mosquito bites bring on, according to the same authority, deadly fevers: the superstition probably arises from the fact that mosquitoes and fevers become formidable about the same time. , and destitute of furniture. Parallel to it are three smaller apartments; and above is a terraced roof, where they who fear not the dew and the land-breeze sleep. * Such a building at Zayla would cost at most 500 dollars. At Aden, 2000 rupees, or nearly double the sum, would be paid for a matted shed, which excludes neither sun, nor wind, nor rain. I found a room duly prepared; the ground was spread with mats, and cushions against the walls denoted the Divan: for me was placed a Kursi or cot, covered with fine Persian rugs and gaudy silk and satin pillows. The Hajj installed us with ceremony, and insisted, despite my remonstrances, upon occupying the floor whilst I sat on the raised seat. After ushering in supper, he considerately remarked that travelling is fatiguing, and left us to sleep.',\n",

Sometimes comes the Sayyid Mohammed el Barr, a stout personage, formerly governor of Zayla, and still highly respected by the people on acount of his pure pedigree. With him is the Fakih Adan, a savan of ignoble origin. * The system of caste, which prevails in El Yemen, though not in the northern parts of Arabia, is general throughout the Somali country. The principal families of outcasts are the following. The Yebir correspond with the Dushan of Southern Arabia: the males are usually jesters to the chiefs, and both sexes take certain parts at festivals, marriages, and circumcisions. The number is said to be small, amounting to about 100 families in the northern Somali country. The Tomal or Handad, the blacksmiths, originally of Aydur race, have become vile by intermarriage with serviles. They must now wed maidens of their own class, and live apart from the community: their magical practices are feared by the people, ‚Äîthe connection of wits and witchcraft is obvious,‚Äîand all private quarrels are traced to them. It has been observed that the blacksmith has ever been looked upon with awe by barbarians on the same principle that made Vulcan a deity. In Abyssinia all artisans are Budah, sorcerers, especially the blacksmith, and he is a social outcast as among the Somal; even in El Hejaz, a land, unlike Yemen, opposed to distinctions amongst Moslems, the Khalawiyah, who work in metal, are considered vile. Throughout the rest of El Islam the blacksmith is respected as treading in the path of David, the father of the craft. The word ‚ÄúTomal,‚Äù opposed to Somal, is indigenous. ‚ÄúHandad‚Äù is palpably a corruption of the Arabic ‚ÄúHaddad,‚Äù iron-worker. . The Midgan, ‚Äúone-hand,‚Äù corresponds with the Khadim of Yemen: he is called Rami or ‚Äúarcher‚Äù by the Arabs. There are three distinct tribes of this people, who are numerous in the Somali country: the best genealogists cannot trace their origin, though some are silly enough to derive them, like the Akhdam, from Shimr. All, however, agree in expelling the Midgan from the gentle blood of Somali land, and his position has been compared to that of Freedman amongst the Romans. These people take service under the different chiefs, who sometimes entertain great numbers to aid in forays and frays; they do not, however, confine themselves to one craft. Many Midgans employ themselves in hunting and agriculture. Instead of spear and shield, they carry bows and a quiver full of diminutive arrows, barbed and poisoned with the Waba,‚Äîa weapon used from Faizoghli to the Cape of Good Hope. Like the Veddah of Ceylon, the Midgan is a poor shot, and scarcely strong enough to draw his stiff bow. He is accused of maliciousness; and the twanging of his string will put to flight a whole village. The poison is greatly feared: it causes, say the people, the hair and nails to drop off, and kills a man in half an hour. The only treatment known is instant excision of the part; and this is done the more frequently, because here, as in other parts of Africa, such stigmates are deemed ornamental. In appearance the Midgan is dark and somewhat stunted; he is known to the people by peculiarities of countenance and accent. When they appear the conversation becomes intensely intellectual: sometimes we dispute religion, sometimes politics, at others history and other humanities.

The Audulli or woman‚Äôs necklace is a more elaborate affair of amber, glass beads, generally coloured, and coral: every matron who can afford it, possesses at least one of these ornaments.

Few begin the day with prayer as Moslems should: for the most part they apply themselves to counting and milking their cattle. The animals, all of which have namest ** For instance, Anfarr, the ‚ÄúSpotted;‚Äù Tarren, ‚ÄúWheatflour;‚Äù &c. &c. , come when called to the pail, and supply the family with a morning meal. Then the warriors, grasping their spears, and sometimes the young women armed only with staves, drive their herds to pasture: the matrons and children, spinning or rope-making, tend the flocks, and the kraal is abandoned to the very young, the old, and the sick. The herdsmen wander about, watching the cattle and tasting nothing but the pure element or a pinch of coarse tobacco. Sometimes they play at Shahh, Shantarah, and other games, of which they are passionately fond: with a board formed of lines traced in the sand, and bits of dry wood or camel‚Äôs earth acting pieces, they spend hour after hour, every looker-on vociferating his opinion, and catching at the men, till apparently the two players are those least interested in the game. Or, to drive off sleep, they sit whistling to their flocks, or they perform upon the Forimo, a reed pipe generally made at Harar, which has a plaintive sound uncommonly pleasing. * It is used by the northern people, the Abyssinians, Gallas, Adail, Eesa and Gudabirsi; the southern Somal ignore it. In the evening, the kraal again resounds with lowing and bleating: the camel‚Äôs milk is all drunk, the cow‚Äôs and goat‚Äôs reserved for butter and ghee, which the women prepare; the numbers are once more counted, and the animals are carefully penned up for the night. This simple life is varied by an occasional birth and marriage, dance and foray, disease and murder. Their maladies are few and simple ** The most dangerous disease is small-pox, which history traces to Eastern Abyssinia, where it still becomes at times a violent epidemic, sweeping off its thousands. The patient, if a man of note, is placed upon the sand, and fed with rice or millet bread till he recovers or dies. The chicken-pox kills many infants; they are treated by bathing in the fresh blood of a sheep, covered with the skin, and exposed to the sun. Smoke and glare, dirt and flies, cold winds and naked extremities, cause ophthalmia, especially in the hills; this disease rarely blinds any save the citizens, and no remedy is known. Dysentery is cured by rice and sour milk, patients also drink clarified cow‚Äôs butter; and in bad cases the stomach is cauterized, fire and disease, according to the Somal, never coexisting. Haemorroids, when dry, are reduced by a stick used as a bougie and allowed to remain in loco all night. Sometimes the part affected is cupped with a horn and knife, or a leech performs excision. The diet is camels‚Äô or goats‚Äô flesh and milk; clarified butter and Bussorah dates ‚Äî rice and mutton are carefully avoided. For a certain local disease, they use senna or colocynth, anoint the body with sulphur boiled in ghee, and expose it to the sun,M41:P41 or they leave the patient all night in the dew; ‚Äî abstinence and perspiration generally effect a cure. For the minor form, the afflicted drink the melted fat of a sheep‚Äôs tail. Consumption is a family complaint, and therefore considered incurable; to use the Somali expression, they address the patient with ‚ÄúAllah, have mercy upon thee!‚Äù not with ‚ÄúAllah cure thee!‚Äù There are leeches who have secret simples for curing wounds. Generally the blood is squeezed out, the place is washed with water, the lips are sewn up and a dressing of astringent leaves is applied. They have splints for fractures, and they can reduce dislocations. A medical friend at Aden partially dislocated his knee, which half-a-dozen of the faculty insisted upon treating as a sprain. Of all his tortures none was more severe than that inflicted by my Somali visitors.

The disease is sometimes diagnosed in people suffering from tuberculosis or pneumonia and the general symptoms are coughing, sneezing, and vomiting with occasional lapses into unconsciousness. This ailment is treated by wadaads, particularly those who have previously suffered from it, who adjure the spirit to quit the patient by reading potent verses of the Quran and bathing him with perfume. Perfume in Somaliland has a ritual significance and is associated with religious celebrations. Frequently on Fridays when men are holding a religious ceremony perfume is poured liberally over the hands of those taking part.  These wadaads of the spirit world were, it is believed, formerly the familiars of Boqor ‚ÄòIsmaan, Sultan of the Majeerteen ‚ÄòIsmaan Mahamuud; and when he died are said to have been released to trouble people.

In Somaliland there is a fairly well-developed ritual of exorcism conducted mainly by women who have previously suffered from the disease who are considered to have ‚Äòauthority‚Äô over the spirit.

Further discussion of saar would be outside the scope of this chapter, indeed of this book, and I merely record here that saar possession is generally looked at askance by the majority of sheikhs and wadaads, the consensus of opinion being that it is unorthodox.

This applies to, for instance, the fal or soothsaying (cf. fallow, ‚Äúsoothsayer‚Äù) which is obviously what Antoniotti has in mind when he writes ‚Äúat the beginning of every therapy, the sick person must recognize the source of the illness‚Äù (1984:160). Rather, it is by drawing upon the explicitly wild, the strange and the unknown that one attempts to restore health. Significantly, Tresalti reports from a village in southern Somalia that the absence of privacy at modern clinics inhibits many people from choosing that type of therapy (1984:205). This suggests that healing may be regarded as something inherently private, something which deliberately should be concealed from the eyes of the public.',\n",

Rather, the ambiguous is defined as an inherent part of the world view where it opposes concepts of the familiar and known. The duur (bush) is both the domain of wild animals and of health restoring plants. Plants themselves can be used for malicious as well as healing purposes. Similarly, the system of cosmic correspondences suggested in the therapies based on the Sufi traditions, have the character of truths which have been hidden in the world by God. Strangers, although they may be potential enemies are also those with the most powerful medicines. Whether it is dressed in the shape of social, spatial or temporal categories, the contrast between the familiar and the unknown pervades Somali culture, and the power of the unknown is not restricted to contexts of healing. Hypothetically, it could be suggested that ‚Äúthe incorporation of the unknown‚Äù for healing purposes parallels the incorporation of strangers into southern Somali clans. Strangers, shisheeye, no matter how ambiguous they may appear, are a resource that adds to the numbers and prestige of the adopting lineage. The suggestion of such an analogy, if further substantitated, could help to account for the differences between southern Somali medicine and some other African medical traditions that I have pointed to above.',\n",

       "  'passage': 'Saar in Somali describes a state of possession by a spirit also called saar . The extreme symptoms are frenzy, fits, or madness, and the spirit itself is, in the Islamic setting, described as a kind of jinn whose malignant powers cause certain types of sickness. Among the eastern tribes of northern Somaliland ‚Äòinvisible‚Äô wadaad (see above) act similarly to saar but have less serious effects and are merely responsible for some minor forms of illness. Saar can be expelled by persons who have acquired mastery over the spirits through having themselves been previously possessed. In northern Somaliland such ‚Äòdoctors‚Äô ( alaqa ) are generally women, for visitation is here confined almost exclusively to this sex, especially to the wealthy. Rich women who believe that a saar is troubling them have recourse to an alaqa: poor women cannot afford to be afflicted by saar because treatment is costly. Such an illogical situation leads sceptical Somalis to abandon their belief in saar . This is not the place nor is there at present sufficient material on the social contexts in which saar are active, to enter into a sociological discussion of the subject. It seems possible, however, that we are concerned with a form of the witchcraft which is associated with wealth and polygamy elsewhere and which serves as a vehicle for jealousy and as a buttress of social status. Saar are expelled in the ‚Äòdance of the saar ‚Äô which is apparently fairly extensively practised in Somalia although violently opposed by Muslim wadaad . In northern Somaliland, where official opposition is such that many devout Muslims deny its existence, 1 In fact in 1955 the British Somaliland Protectorate Advisory Council unanimously agreed that legislation should be introduced to make the practice of saar rites illegal. War Somali Sidihi, No. 60, 23 April 1955. the dance is sometimes still performed by women. It seems that the dance acts as a form of exorcism of the malevolent jinn causing possession, and perhaps less frequently as a means of attaining possession. In Somalia, the opening movement is called or-goys and consists of those assembled beginning to sing and to raise their arms rhythmically towards the sky. Soon someone falls in a faint and his companions ‚Äòbeat the saar ‚Äô, forming a circle round him and breaking into ‚Äòthe song of the saar ‚Äô, sung at first slowly and then with increasing tempo. Drumming, castanet-playing, and handclapping swell the singing. Slowly the fallen dancer revives, and moving his limbs in rhythm, seizes a knife or lighted brand which he thrusts between his teeth and dances into the semi-circle formed by the others. The tempo increases until the dancer again succumbs and falls panting to the ground. After a little he rises completely restored and the saar is said to have left him. 2 Among the Cushitic Agao of Gondar in northern Ethiopia, the refractions of the Sky God ( Zar ) which possess people are called zar, are associated especially but not exclusively with women, are inherited in the family, and have genealogies corresponding to their territorial distribution (Leiris, 1934 (1), 134, 126). The dance is widely distributed among the Cushitic peoples of north-east Africa and often the possessed dancer acts as an oracle 3 The After (Danakil) of southern Eritrea and of Ethiopia have a similar ceremony in which the possessed dancer is called jenile (jinn?) . See Licata, 1885, 267; Thesiger, 1935, 8. (see Leiris, 1934). Beyond the Cushitic areas, it occurs as far away as Egypt (Kahle, 1912), the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (Trimingham, 1949, pp. 174-7), and even the Hijaz (Hurgronje, 1888-9, II, pp. 124-8). The explanation seems to be that the saar (Zar) dance has spread far beyond the bounds of Cushitic culture with the export of slaves from Ethiopia where it has its Cushitic origin (Cerulli, 1933, II, p. 35).',\n",

In certain situations tribes are described as linked to trees and animals which are addressed by maternal kinship names, but the connexion does not appear to be totemic. Spirit-refractions are said to have their seats in those possessed, and, among the Cushitic Agao of Gondar in Ethiopia the spirit-ridden subject is referred to as the spirit‚Äôs ‚Äòhorse‚Äô. A similar spirit is encountered and overcome in the crossing the threshold ceremony ( kalaqaad ) which marks a male child‚Äôs first expedition outside his mother‚Äôs hut. The baby is carried over the threshold by his mother‚Äôs brother (Cerulli, 1919, p. 23). Although generally obscured by and syncreted in Islam, divining and various forms of sympathetic magic are still practised. Ordeals and oath-taking by swearing on stones are used to establish testimony. Charms and amulets, especially as prophylactics, enjoy wide popularity. Their efficacy, now, of course, depends upon association with the Holy Koran. In this context it is perhaps not irrelevant to mention the fire-kindling ceremony of dobshid which is widely observed and marks the commencement of the solar year. 1 See Lewis, 1955, 62.

       "  'passage': 'Comparison of the pre-Islamic Somali spirit-world with Muslim angelology and demonology reveals again the much higher degree of systematization in the latter. In Muslim theology, angels, pre-eminent amongst whom is Gabriel, generally figure as Divine Messengers created by God to serve and worship Him. They are charged with recording man‚Äôs actions in this life, receiving his soul in heaven, and acting as his counsel on the day of judgment. On the other hand, jinn are those rebellious spirits created similarly to man, but of fire in place of earth, and committed to Solomon‚Äôs keeping, who seek to lead man astray and to subvert the teachings of the prophets. It is as jinn that the majority of pre-Islamic spirits previously associated with Waaq are assimilated in Islam. This is illustrated in the following tale current among the Gasar Gudda tribe of Somalia. ‚ÄòSolomon, son of David, on whom be peace, commanded all men, all the animals, the wind, spirits, and demons, the entire kingdom of the Great King. One day the jinn were at work as usual, and Solomon, leaning against a tree, seemed to be watching them although he gave no sign of repose. Solomon was dead, but remained supported by the tree while the jinn unaware of what had happened went on with their work. At last the termites succeeded in eating their way through Solomon‚Äôs support precipitating him heavily on to the ground. The jinn quickly ran to the spot and saw that the son of David was dead. They began to rejoice for now they could stop working since their master was dead. They hastened to the termites and made a pact with them, saying, ‚ÄúYou make your nest of earth and we will bring the water for its strengthening‚Äù. From this time forth jinn and termites are in alliance‚Äô (Ferrandi, 1903, p. 309). Here within Islam the spirits attendant upon the mysterious construction of termite mounds are associated with jinn in Solomon‚Äôs keeping. The relation ‚Äòspirits‚Äîtermites‚Äô is given Muslim sanction in Solomon‚Äôs authority over jinn . Similarly the source of the efficacy of divination, ordeals, charms, and prophylactic amulets has been transferred from Waaq to Allah when beneficent and to jinn when mischievous or evil. Now the favourite amulet is the Sufi rosary ( tusbah ) whose 99 beads remind the believer of the innumerable praise-names of Allah and help him to perform his prayer-tasks. Perhaps equally popular as amulets are small leather pouches armed with inscriptions from the Koran. Thus phenomena which formerly owed their power to some connexion with Waaq now originate in Allah, the ultimate source of all power. 1 cf. the fate of the pre-Islamic Gods and spirits in Arabia, Koran, Sura XXXVII. For general indications of the universality of such syncretisms in Islam, see Gibb, 1947, 23 ff.; Miliot, 1949, 643. Saar spirits are described by Somali as a kind of jinn . The whole spirit hierarchy of Waaq is being progressively Islamized. This is a process which naturally also applies to God‚Äôs attributes. Among the Gasar Gudda, again, the rainbow, from being the Sky God‚Äôs belt, has become the path good souls take to heaven, although it is also contended by some to be the smoke made by rain falling upon termite hills. Rain-drops are believed to turn into angels (an understandable evaluation); thunder ( uri ) is the voice of angels ( malaika ) or the noise of their combat in striving to stop rain. Lightning ( birk ) darts forth from the armpits of melek Mikail, the archangel Michael. 1 Ferrandi, 1903, 298 ff. Michael ( Sura, II) appears thus to be taken as a symbol of war. These are a few examples indicative of the way in which the Muslim spirit hierarchy is understood in terms of Cushitic cosmology.',\n",

Throughout her marriage she is expected to obey, honour, and respect her spouse, and to be particularly scrupulous in this regard in the early years of marriage. Immediately after the wedding her subordination to her husband is emphasised in the traditional beating which her husband administers on the wedding night with a ceremonial whip ( jeedal ). In practice this instrument is rarely seen today, but is said to have been proudly carried by all newly married husbands in the past as a sign of their new marital authority. Today the bride may receive no more than a token cuffing. Other gestures of submission are expected by the husband. His bride should remove his sandals on the wedding night and in the early days of marriage. In contrast to their own exuberance, men even regard the pain which a bride experiences on her first nights of intercourse through the opening and enlargement of the infibulated vulva as a further expression of male virility and female submission. 1 . Men sometimes boas! that their virility is such that they can, unaided, force an opening in the infibulated vulva. Generally, however, the bride‚Äôs mother, or if the marriage is celebrated at the husband‚Äôs home, his mother, opens the vulva with a small knife. This is said to be something that amother readily does for her daughter as the wishes to make everything ‚Äòsmooth‚Äô for the couple. Sometimes, however, the incision is made by a woman of the despised occupational group who, amongst other things, specialise in infibulation. There is no doubt that in the early weeks of a first marriage most women experience much pain. In addition, the forced removal of a bride to her marriage hut by her husband‚Äôs friends, which is reported to take place in some weddings, although I have not witnessed it, can be seen to emphasise the dominant role of the man and the subservient, even captive, status of the woman. 2 . Cerulli who reports this amongst the Majeerteen argues from it to a former state of marriage by capture (Cerulli, 1919, p. 73). But as far as I know, there is no sound evidence to suggest that marriage by capture was ever a general process in northern Somaliland.',\n",

They cause falling stars and illness, can predict future events, but above all claim the prerogative as to various kinds of food, which unauthorized mortals consume under pain of sickness and death. The bope possesses a bari and eats the dishes in question with the bari's mouth. These spirits also appear in dreams and reveal the future, but they take no interest in the social life of the Indians and do not in any significant way figure in any myth. A bari becomes such through visitations of a bope. He must scrupulously observe the rules laid down to him on pain of loss of power and catching an incurable disease. However, the bope may render him invulnerable and give him the power to hunt game in the guise of a jaguar. The bari may inflict disease and death, but also cures and confers other benefits on the tribe. A client will offer him a cigar, whereupon the shaman calls on the bope, a number of whom led by a spokesman then possess him. In doctoring, the bari smokes the cigar, then the spokesman of the spirits asks why they have been called. One present explains, then the doctor sucks the afflicted parts, expectorating the putative cause, e. g., a beetle, which he scans, announcing his prognosis. Certain feminine diseases, however, he must not attempt treating lest he impair his supernatural powers. Most important of the bari's functions is the ‚Äúconsecration‚Äù of the food reserved to the bope--a procedure that ensures to himself the choicest morsels.

Every aroe is tangibly represented in two ways: by its impersonator at the funeral ceremony, and by a flageolet with a gourd bearing the distinctive clan designs and preserved by the dead person's clansmen in memory of him.

The sun was about to set ... We needed to think of wood for the night fire ... It was probable that some ounce would want to pay us an unwanted visit: the fire would protect us and give us the coals for roasting the fish. We told the Indians that they should immediately take care of the fishing: they were masters at that; we would go to look for firewood... So it was done: our job was very easy: firewood is not lacking in the thicket; we piled up enough and afterwards remained watching the Indians with their lines cast into the dark-green waters of the river ... By the movement of the lines, held surely in the Indians' hands, one could see perfectly that the fish were abundant and that they were biting constantly. In those moments the superattention of the sylvicolists was remarkable ... Suddenly, a line becomes taut; the Indian, alert, gives the pull of a master; the fish is caught on the hook. The savage makes a Herculean effort to conquer the resistance which the fish puts up against being brought to the surface. All of us, curious, were waiting for the last pull which would put the fish on dry land ... At the instant when the flattened head of the fish emerged a few meters from the beach, the Indian, unexpectedly, lets go of the line, makes a jump backwards, turns his back to the river, runs a few 118 cont. steps in toward the beach, and remains motionless, covering his face with his hands ... The scene was so fast that, when we saw it, everything had already happened: the fish had gone away with the entire line. The other Indians gathered up their fishhooks, which they had in their hands, and, without saying a word, went to lie down near the fire. Disturbed, even more impressed by what we had witnessed, we asked the why of such great and harmful extravagance. After a few moments, as if not to seem ill-mannered, they answered quite low, barely to be heard: ‚Äú bope (spirit of the evil) Kidokia, pirarara (smooth-skinned fish of the nature of the ja√∫ /Paulicea lutkeni/. These two words were sufficient to explain everything, and we did not inquire any further. Kidokia is a forbidden fish, it is the food reserved for the bope , the most vengeful of the evil spirits and the chief of all. Woe to the bor√≥ro who would have dared to pull such a fish from the waters! The spirit of evil would have punished him with sickness and death. As much as we insisted that they try fishing anew, it was impossible to convince them: they remained hungry and did not even want to drink water; such was the dread that seized them. We, however, did not abandon at least killing our thirst; as for the rest, we had to resign ourselves to our bad fate. We lay 119 down beside the fire, near the Indians, hoping for better luck the next day.\",\n",

But if it were a question of treating of any other aspect of the tribal life of these natives, it would also be found that, whenever they approach any concern of vital importance, they summon magic to their aid. It can be said without exaggeration that magic, according to their ideas, governs human destinies; that it supplies man with the power of mastering the forces of nature; and that it is his weapon and armour against the many dangers which crowd in upon him on every side.) Thus, in what is most essential to man, that is in his health and bodily welfare, he is but a plaything of the powers of sorcery, of evil spirits and of certain beings, controlled by black magic . Death in almost all its forms is the result of one of these agencies. Permanent ill-health and all kinds of acute sickness, in fact everything, except such easily explainable ailments as physical overstrain or slight colds, are attributed to magic. I have spoken (Chapter II) of the several ways in which the evil powers bring disease and death. The tauva'u , who bring epidemics and the tokway , who inflict shooting pains and minor ailments, are the only examples of non-human beings' exerting any direct influence on human destinies, and even the members of this restricted pantheon of demonology only occasionally descend among the mortals to put into action their potential powers. By far the deepest dread and most constant concern of the natives are with the bwaga'u , the entirely human sorcerers, who carry out their work exclusively by means of magic. Second to them in the quantity of magical output and in the frequency of their exploits, are the mulukwausi , the flying witches, which have been described in detail in Chapter XI. They are a good example of how every belief in a superior power is at the bottom a belief in magic. Magic gives to these beings the capacity to destroy human life and to command other agents of destruction. Magic also gives man the power and the means to defend himself, and if properly applied, to frustrate all the nefarious attempts of the mulukwausi . Comparing the two agencies, it may be said that in every-day life, the sorcerer is by far the most feared and is most frequently believed to be at work; while the mulukwausi enter upon the scene at certain dramatic moments, such as the presence of death, a catastrophe on land, and more especially at sea; but then, they enter with even deadlier weapons than the bwaga'u . Health, the normal state of human beings can, if once lost, be regained by magic and by magic only. There is no such thing as natural recovery, return to health being always due to the removal of the evil magic by means of magical counter-action .\",\n",

Thus, whereas a wizard can, at best, inflict a lingering disease, which is easily cured by counter magic, there is \"little chance\" of combating the malevolent activities of a witch ( SLS :4,5-46). Witches-called mulukuauso (Malinowski 1955), or mulukwausi (Malinowski [1922] 1961) -- are \"actual living women who may be known and talked with in ordinary life \\'\" but who, in a disembodied form, \"are extremely virulent, powerful, and also ubiquitous.

Dangerous on land, these \"terrible women\" are even more dangerous on sea, where they destroy shipwrecked sailors (Malinowski [1922] 1961:chapter 10). Although, on land, witches may sometimes cause such ailments as toothaches, swelling of the testicles, tumors, and genital discharge ( SLS :47), more typically they kill and eat their unfortunate victims. Pouncing on them from some hidden -- usually high --place, the invisible witch removes their insides, together with their eyes and tongue, before eating them ( SLS :45). Possessed of \"ghoulish instincts,\" witches not only eat their living victims, but also devour entire corpses, thereby be-coming \"more than ever dangerous to the living\" (Malinowski 1955:153). That is why, following a death, Trobrianders refuse to talk about the village or to enter the surrounding cultivated land.

Many of these break off short and in due course set up irritation necessitating their removal. Firstly the sufferer tries to remove the foreign body from the skin with his finger-nails; failing to succeed by this method, he cuts a small piece of wood the shape of an awl, and with its sharp point removes the obstacle. The prickle is often completely buried and quite invisible to the eye, yet it has to be removed. In order to locate it under those conditions, the aboriginal resorts to the method, not infrequently applied [118] by the modern surgeon, of gently pressing the skin at different places with the tip of the instrument until the seat of pain has been located. At that spot he cuts away the skin to a depth sufficient to expose the hidden body, which he can then in most cases express with his fingers.

If anyone should alter these ceremonies in the slightest, or irreverently show them to the uninitiated, some terrible evil is certain to fall upon the offender as punishment. After I had completed writing down the myth of Krantjirinja, the kangaroo chief of Krantji, the members of the Krantji group presented a series of ceremonies known as Utnitjia Nama. These are the most secret of all the multitudinous rites performed near the Northern kangaroo centre, rites which in past times might be witnessed only by members of the inner kangaroo clan of Krantji. All other men were rigidly excluded from Utnitjia Nama ceremonies, even if they belonged to neighbouring Northern Aranda totemic groups. At my Alice Springs camp, however, quite a number of Northern men other than those belonging to the kangaroo totem, were allowed to witness these increase-rites by Ekuntjarinja, the present leader of the Krantji clan. A few days later he suddenly took ill, and complained of acute pains in his back; and both he and the other elderly [30] men present were certain that these pains had been caused by the anger of the offended Krantjirinja himself, who had struck Ekuntjarinja because the latter had frivolously exhibited the sacred ceremonies to people to whom he had been strictly forbidden to show them by his elders when they first instructed him. And their belief in his illness being the effect of supernatural retribution on the part of the kangaroo ancestor remained unshaken, despite the fact that Krantji is over eighty miles west of Alice Springs; the original Krantjirinja had never visited Alice Springs; indeed, he had never moved more than a few miles away from his native soak.',\n",

The word lurpmanjurmankur, translated here as arunkulta , really means the marks of decoration on the bone.

They believe that the spirit part of the child goes back at once to the particular spot from whence it came, and can be born again at some subsequent time even of the same woman. Twins, which are of extremely rare occurrence, are usually killed immediately as something which is unnatural; but there is no ill-treatment of the mother, who is not thought any the less of. We cannot find out what, exactly, lies at the root of this dislike of twins in the case of the Arunta and other tribes. Possibly it is to be explained on the simple ground that the parent feels a not altogether unrighteous anger that two spirit individuals should think of entering the body of the woman at one and the same time, when they know well that the mother could not possibly rear them both, added to which the advent of twins is a very infrequent event, and the native always has a dread of anything which appears strange and out of the common. In connection with this it may be noted that on the very rare occasions on which the child is born at a very premature stage as the result of an accident, nothing will persuade them that it is an undeveloped human being; they are perfectly convinced that it is the young of some other animal, such as a kangaroo, which has by mistake got inside the woman. 1 Sterility is of frequent occurrence at the present day amongst the native women.

In serious cases the action is more dramatic, and the medicine man needs a clear space in which to perform. The patient, perhaps too ill to sit up, is supported by some individual, while the medicine man who has been called in, and may have come a long distance, gravely examines him and consults with other practirioners who may be present, and with the more immediate relatives of the patient, as to the nature of the illness. The diagnosis may occupy some time, during which everyone maintains a very solemn appearance, all conversation being carried on in whispers. As a result the medicine man will perhaps pronounce that the sick man is suffering from a charmed bone inserted by a magic individual, such as a Kurdaitcha; or perhaps, worse still, the verdict is that one of the Iruntarinia has placed in his body an Ullinka or short barbed stick attached to an invisible string, the pulling of which by the malicious spirit causes great pain (Fig. 119 nos. 10, 11). If the latter be the case it requires the greatest skill of a renowned medicine man to effect a cure. While the patient is supported in a half-sitting attitude, the medicine man will first of all stand close by, gazing down upon him in the most intent way. Then suddenly he will go some yards off, and looking fiercely at him, bends slightly forwards and repeatedly jerks his arm outwards at full length, with the hand outstretched, the object being thereby to project some of the Atnongara stones into the patient's body, the object of this being to counteract the evil influence at work within the latter. Going rapidly and with a characteristic high knee action from one end of the cleared space to the other, he repeats the movement with dramatic action. Finally, he comes close again, and, after much mysterious searching, finds and cuts the string, which is invisible to everyone except himself. There is not a doubt amongst the onlookers as to his having really done this. Then once more the projecting of the Ainongara stones takes place, and crouching down over the sick man he places his mouth upon the afiected part and sucks, until at last the Ullinka is extracted, either in fragments or, very rarely, and only if he be a very distinguished medicine man, whole, and is shown to the wondering onlookers, the Atnongara stones returning, unseen, once more into his own body. When this is over, unless it is simply a case of senile decay-on the part of the patient, in which case the medicine man is too acute to take so much trouble, when he knows pretty well that there is no possibility of effecting a cure, the chances are strongly in favour of the latter, but if death ensues FIG. 120.--POSITION ASSUMED WHEN USING THE UNGAKURA POINTING APPARATUS. ARUNTA TRIBE. FIG. 121.--POSITION ASSUMED WHEN POINTING THE IRNA. ARUNTA TRIBE. it is simply because the magic stick has been inserted in some vital part, or because the aid of the medicine man had not been called in early enough, or because his efforts had been maliciously thwarted by some Iruntarinia.\",\n",

There is no doubt whatever that a native will die aiter the infliction of even a most superficial wound if only he believes the weapon which inflieted the wound had been ‚Äúsung‚Äù over and thus endowed with Arungquilta. He simply lies down, refuses food and pines away. Not long ago a man from Barrow Creek received a slight wound in the groin. Though there was apparently nothing serious the matter with him, still he persisted in saying that the spear had been charmed and that he must die, which accordingly he did in the course of a few days. Another man coming down to the Alice Springs from the Tennant Creek contracted a slight cold, but the local men told him that the members of a group about twelve miles away to the east had taken his heart out, and believing this to be so, he simply laid himself down and wasted away. In a similar way a man at Charlotte Waters came to us with a slight spear wound in his back. He was assured that the wound was not serious, and it was dressed in the usual way, but he persisted in saying that the spear had been ‚Äúsung,‚Äù and that though it could not be seen, yet in reality it had broken his back and he was going to die, which accordingly he did. As a result of this a party was organised among the members of his group to avenge his death, and the man who was supposed to have wounded him with the charmed weapon was killed.',\n",

To bring on a painful affection in those of men, a woman will procure the spear-like seed of a long grass ( Inturkirra ),and having charmed it by singing some magic chant over it, she awaits an opportunity to point and throw it towards the man whom she desires to mjure. Shortly after this has been done the man experiences pain, as if he had been stung by ants, his parts become swollen, and he at once attributes his sufferings to the magic influence of some woman who wishes to injure him. A woman may also charm a handful of dust which she collects while out digging up yams or gathering seeds, and having ‚Äúsung‚Äù it, brings it into camp with her. She takes the opportunity of sprinkling it over a spot where the man whom she wishes to injure is likely to micturate. If he should do so at this spot he would experience a scalding sensation in the urethra and afterwards suffer a great amount of pain. Women may also produce disease in men by singing over and thus charming a finger, which is then inserted in the vulva; the man who subsequently has connection with her will become diseased and may lose his organs altogether, and so when a woman wishes to injure a man she will sometimes, after thus ‚Äúpoisoning‚Äù herself, seek an opportunity of soliciting him, though he be not her proper Anua. Syphilitic disease amongst the Arunta is, as a matter of fact, very frequently attributed to this form of magic, for it must be remembered that the native can only understand disease of any form as due to evil magic, and he has to provide what appears to him to be a suitable form of magic to account for each form of disease.',\n",

They are of the type: X is true because Y has happened; or, alternatively, since Y, then X. Garfinkel has called this the documentary method (Garfinkel n.d.). It is characteristic of the documentary method that there is hardly ever a set of past events which deny some set of inferences the documentary method provides. 2 This characteristic of the documentary method is explicated in an experiment by Garfinkel ( op. cit .). Subjects were told that they should report by phone to counselors serious problems they were experiencing. Whenever the subject thought of a question to which the counselor could answer yes or no, he was instructed to ask the question. The counselor then answered each question yes or no. The subjects were required to interpret the counselor's response. In every case the subjects were able to ‚Äúmake sense‚Äù out of the counselor's response. The counselors' responses were drawn from a table of random numbers. Thus, in Aguacatenango, an epidemic stops because the witch who was causing it has been killed; if, on the other hand, the epidemic does not stop with the killing of a witch, then another witch must be responsible. Again, a sick person gets well because a curing ceremony has been performed; if he does not get well after the ceremony, then his illness must be witchcraft and the witch more powerful than the curer. The documentary method is never wrong. This may be one reason most ‚Äúprimitive‚Äù belief systems require so much pressure before they can be brought under our documentary rules.\",\n",

In the present case we depend upon verbal contexts to establish relevance from the informant's point of view, and we use verbal contexts to test non-simulated performances in order to determine the salience of illness in the record of any situation we may be examining.

Types of experiences which lead the individual to anticipate illness include either becoming angry or being an object of anger; experiencing extreme fright, as when one has had dreams, or has seen the image of some malevolent non-human force (i.e., a ladino dressed in black riding a tall horse); and drinking aguardiente. These and similar experiences carry permanent associations with illness; the individual expects to become ill and often does so.

If a change capability is built into this theory of illness in Aguacatenango, it is not easy to detect wherein it lies. 1 The modes of change that we have observed in Aguacatenangueros' response to illness have involved shifts from known medical practitioners to others, where the theory remains relatively unexplicated and the results of the medical practitioner's progress are used to judge the probability of opting some particular medical practitioner for a cure rather than some other. Response to illness involves the principle of exhaustion of resources. In severe illness, the family of the patient may exhaust all known medical practitioners who are thought to have sufficient knowledge and skill and also may exhaust all means for motivating curers to come and perform the cure. With the diminution of resources and exhaustion of the most proper curers, the family of the patient explores curing sources whose potential for curing may be lower, but still appreciable. Successful curing under such circumstances raises the probability that this family will use some newly successful medical practitioner sooner in the next onset of illness, that is, he will be called upon before they have exhausted their resources. The introduction of INI medical practice into Aguacatenango has been in these terms, namely, that patients and their families have turned to INI medical personnel upon the exhaustion of their resources. INI procedures have maintained a ratio of successes over failures in these curing circumstances such that they have continued to be called upon, in some cases under less extreme conditions. The ratio of successes over failures has not been so great, however, that INI is seen to be a totally satisfactory replacement for the more well established practitioners. Furthermore, INI treats only a small proportion of the total range of ‚Äúillnesses‚Äù that occur in the community. INI will increase the proportion of cases it treats as it modifies the Aguacatenangueros' perception of the success' failure ratio and as it increases the classes of illness that it deals with. It may be the case that INI has at present a maximal investment in time and resources in maintaining its present range and success proportion, so future severe changes may not be expected from them. There is, however, some generalization to other INI type of curers--namely, doctors in San Cristobal. The generalization here may increase the use of doctors over curers. There is the further possibility that curers are incorporating into their theories some of the simpler strategies used by doctors. This is done so crudely that it hardly involves change of beliefs at any detailed level, but rather involves a simple increase of the inventories of medicine by means of which the curer implements his theory.\",\n",

In addition, they deal with illnesses in sufficiently contrastive ways so that two role identifying labels must be maintained. They are both recognized to be able to reduce illness (as a basis for further inference and action) by prescribing medicines that can be purchased in the pharmacy. These may be taken orally, injected, or applied as a salve. The doctor further prescribes and may himself perform some minor surgery, X-ray examinations, and other traditional Western-European strategies for diagnosing and reducing illness. The curer does not engage in surgery, nor does he prescribe any of the more complex testing procedures whose results he does not imagine himself to be able to interpret. Instead, he recommends additional substances he purchased from the pharmacy such as tallow, wines, herbs in aguardientes as well as substances which are sometimes found in domesticated state, and more often found wild in the general vicinity of Aguacatenango. These include some kinds of flowers, bark, leaves, roots, stems, flesh of animals and fishes, animal waste products, eggs and so on. These substances are variously taken orally, applied externally, or inhaled as steam. Unlike doctors, curers practice bleeding and cupping; they also administer some medications in the form of steam while the patient is seated on a platform over a fire. They incorporate adornment of the sick-bed into curing ritual. The ritual may also include prayer. Most important, perhaps, the curers undertake to examine the recent life history of the individual who is ill, in terms of the possibility that the individual has encountered some disease producing entity which can explain, in his particular case, the onset of the disease process. There is no illness for which the curer does not have an explanation together with a set of strategies for dealing with it. At present, at least one curer, when confronted with very serious cases, will refer his patient to a doctor, but this does not yet appear to be a popular alternative. Generally, the doctor is the last of all medical practitioners referred to in exhausting the curing options in Aguacatenango, though individuals who have had a successful relationship with the doctor are more likely to pursue that option sooner. The only other major class of medical practitioners is the talking saint. Talking saints are more or less representational images of saints who, in conjunction with their ‚Äúowners‚Äù can actively consult with human beings about their trials and tribulations in the world. The most powerful of this class, San Miguel of Soyal√≥, is about an eight hour trip and a 200 peso fee from Aguacatenango. Talking saints share more features with the curers than they do with doctors. They, like the curers, are predestined by God to their role, but they more directly represent God's omniscience. The cure of the talking sai it is more powerful as can be measured by the greater expenditure of funds for such a cure, or as can be measured by his greater ability to divine in the life history of the patient the principal sources of illness.\",\n",

This may be associated with the fact that the membership of the drinking group in Aguacatenango is least well defined and hence the one where enemies are most likely to be encountered. Likewise it is the one in which aggressive performances are most likely to occur. 1 This interpretation would have it that aguardiente becomes a physical medium by means of which the anger of the witch is transmitted to his target. Most aguardiente I have drunk has swirling hair in it; so foreign substance is not uncommon and thus available for potential interpretation. To restate the matter slightly, we may say: there is a language of aguardiente which depends upon the visual cues in examining the liquid. It is a one information bit language. The bit reads: If the aguardiente is clear when one is offered a drink, drink it and thank the drinker. If the aguardiente is ‚Äúswirling-hairful,‚Äù and one is offered a drink, break the glass or bottle and beat the offerer up. One general performance the drink pourer engages in on most occasions I have observed is as follows: He pours the drink into the shot glass, then examines the liquid to see if it is clean or not. If it is not clean, he will attempt to clean it by picking out the foreign substance (sticks, leaves, hair, dirt, etc.). This cleaing response may be conditioned in part by the one bit language mentioned above. (See drinking performance of ayuntamiento where this has been mentioned before.)',\n",

       "  'passage': \"Not only does aguardiente in some contexts serve as medium by means of which witchcraft can be communicated, but also it has a certain disease producing potential of its own when it is taken in certain amounts within a certain time period. (The ceremonial drinking plus one or more adjacent informal drinking units.) We will now review a few of the disease processes which are interpreted as beginning immediately adjacent to drinking performances. The most common illness that results from drinking is a state that may be glossed as a ‚Äúhangover‚Äù /GOMA, XCAMEL YUUN TRAWO/. This is a minor illness which involves the symptoms of ‚Äúheadache, loss of appetite, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, trembling,‚Äù the response to which is selected from the following alternative set. The condition of GOMA is nearly exclusive with the ability to engage in routine agricultural performances. This means that the day after a ceremonial drinking plus informal drinking segment, a man does not work. He has the choice, then, of staying around the house or leaving the house to perform some minor tasks such as gathering poles to support chayote vines, looking at his cattle, or any other task that takes him out of the household setting. This is an important distinction since if a man stays around the house he increases the probability that he will continue drinking by some considerable degree. The confusion of setting with cure for GOMA is further reduced if we consider the specific remedies which are employed. Aguardiente is a ‚Äúhot‚Äù substance. This ‚Äúheat‚Äù causes the illness, and the illness can be reduced by drinking remedies which are ‚Äúcool‚Äù or ‚Äúcold.‚Äù Coca cola is such a remedy. A man may stay around the house and drink coca cola by way of reducing the GOMA. A second remedy for reducing a hangover is to drink as much as onehalf a pint of aguardiente. This is the Tzeltal equivalent to the ‚Äúhair of the dog‚Äù response. Drinking a small amount of aguardiente and staying around the house are the two conditions which make it most likely that the man will continue drinking that day. Drinking coca cola and staying around the house make it slightly less likely that a man will drink on that day. Finally, drinking either aguardiente or coca cola and leaving the house to perform some minor task makes it less and less probable that a man will go on drinking that day. These observations are relevant to an interpretation of the cure for a hangover since they clearly include alternative plans for furth action which either produce further hangovers or do not. In other words, if one wishes to cure a hangover and go on drinkin he drinks aguardiente and stays in his house where his previous day's drinking companions will be sure to find him. If, on the other hand, one wishes to stop drinking, he will drink coca cola and leave the house.\",\n",

       "  'passage': \"Aguardiente is illness-producing either directly because of its substance, or symbolically because it is one of the media by means of which a witch causes his victim to ingest poisonous substances. In turn, the drinking of aguardiente is interpreted as a disease process to the extent that individuals take ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù to reduce the number of occasions upon which they drink. The text citations which have been inserted above are suggestive of these points. By way of summing up this section, I would like to offer a less easily verifiable interpretation which provides still further context in terms of which the reader can think about the drinking performances in Aguacatenango. The first simple set of observations is as follows: Men drink and women don't. Some men drink more than others but all men must drink some. Some men would prefer to drink less than they do. Drinking settings for some men, especially under the informal drinking rules, are settings in which some considerable hostility is expressed. Suppose we take the case of the man who wishes to drink less. He can achieve this end in the short run by either drinking more or not drinking at all. He knows that he will not be able to completely terminate his drinking performances (the ceremonial drinking performances) until he is an old man. Ceremonial drinking performances are required of all men. He can, however, reduce the number of informal drinking performances. If a man wants to reduce the number of informal drinking performances, then, he can do so by increasing the average length of any particular informal drinking performance. Increasing the length of an informal drinking performance increases the probability that the individual will become ill (as well as exhaust all his resources, anger the members of his household, and so on). Upon the next occasion when some individual invites him to start an informal drinking performance, he can respond by saying, ‚ÄúI am afraid to start an informal drinking performance with you since my style of informal drinking performance results for me in severe illness, alienates my family, causes economic catastrophe to my household.‚Äù The person inviting must allow that this is true, in view of the fact that he observed ego engaging in such extended performances within the past year, say. On the other hand, an individual can stop engaging in informal drinking performances by reporting that he has taken medicine for drinking, which medicine will cause his death if he drinks. It is not unusual for a man to take medicine and then become very sick by way of telling the community that it was real medicine with strong disease producing effects. If a man goes on drinking in the informal drinking after he has taken the medicine, it is proof that the medicine did not have the desired effect. The common feature of either response to the desire to reduce amount of drinking: increasing the length of the informal drinking performances or taking medicine puts the individual in that context which allows him to say, ‚ÄúIf I drink I will die.‚Äù We believe that it is only by citing such severe effects as this that an individual can, over the long run, control his response to the invitation to drink. 1 In the short run, a man can avoid any particular, highly probable informal drinking performance by leaving the field, as was suggested above. That is, by knowing which days informal drinking performances are more likely to occur on than other days (the ten day time zone around some major fiesta, or Sundays, for example), he can arrange to be ‚Äúaway on business.‚Äù\",\n",

When this occurs a thread is used to tie the cord close to the baby's stomach. Then the measure of the distance between an outstretched thumb and the middle finger (a hoht ) is applied to the umbilical cord that has been tied. The cord is then cut at this distance, about six inches, from the thread. If the cord is cut short, then when the baby grows up it won't be able to shout very loud, an ability that is important for shouting communications across valleys, on the trail, and between houses. The afterbirth and what remains of the cord are put in the ashes next to the flames of the roaring fire and having dried a little are burnt. If it were not burnt up then the child would be subject to stomach aches throughout its life.\",\n",

       "  'passage': 'Both these statements are incorrect. They were, perhaps, based on a misinterpretation. The Kabaka led the nation in supporting the gods and supplied them lavishly with gifts of tribute, but he did not control them or their cult, as some kings painfully learned. The Kabaka‚Äôs obligatory gifts to the gods indicate a relation of asymmetrical exchange (cf. Kenny 1988: 604). Upon accession, the Kabaka rebuilt the lubaale temples and presented the gods with large endowments of women, slaves, cattle, goats, and cowrie shells in multiples of the sacred number nine. The gods, in turn, exhorted the new king to ‚Äúalways love the gods‚Äù and gave him their blessing (Kaggwa [1907] 1934: 21). Every year, the Kabaka made new presentations to the gods to secure those blessings. He also gave a large number of human victims to the war god Kibuuka whenever Kibuuka‚Äôs temple was rebuilt. While responsible for the upkeep of the country‚Äôs major shrines, the Kabakas never oversaw the worship of the lubaale or governed the priests. On the contrary, when the Kabakas refused to take priestly advice and proceeded to kill the priests and loot their temples, the chronicles say that the lubaale were quick to take revenge. They set illnesses and other afflictions upon the Kabakas in order to put them in their place. In the nineteenth century, the priests of Mukasa regarded Mutesa I as their ‚Äúson-in-law‚Äù (Roscoe 1911: 298), even their ‚Äúslave‚Äù (Ashe 1895: 102n.), a relationship that indicated his subordinate status. The chronicles also report that Mukasa‚Äôs priests generally succeeded in forcing Mutesa I to do their will. To be sure, Mutesa‚Äôs father, Ssuuna II, is said to have boasted that he was the lubaale on earth because he could with impunity plunder the temples of the lubaale of the sky (Roscoe and Kaggwa 1906: 50; Burton [1860] 1961 II: 191). But even the powerful Ssuuna was unable to force the gods to do his bidding. The dynastic accounts say that Ssuuna was struck by lightning sent by lubaale Kiwanuka because he mistreated one of Kiwanuka‚Äôs priests (Kaggwa [1901] 1971: 119). Ssuuna is also said to have died of smallpox because he disobeyed the warnings of the priest of the war god Nnende (Nsimbi 1956b: 134). When Mutesa was ill in 1879, the priest of Mukasa attributed the malady to Mutesa‚Äôs political ambition, which offended Mukasa. Mutesa was thus forced to return the powerful chieftainship of the Mugema to its rightful possessors, the Vervet Monkey clan (Rowe 1967: 154-56; Kaggwa [1901] 1971: 176). As Roscoe himself noted, the temple priesthoods were appointed by the clan heads ( Bataka ), and although it was necessary for the king to ratify priestly appointments, the priesthoods tended to support clan interests (Wright 1971: 4). Even though the king might summon the priest of the war god Kibuuka to the capital, the god could refuse to let him go and the priest would stay at home (Kaggwa [1907] 1934: 222). Kaggwa also notes that Kibuuka was treated like a Kabaka, and his seat was called Nnamulondo, which was the name of the king‚Äôs enthronement stool. It was pointed out to me that ever since Tebandeke, the eighteenth Kabaka, who became a priest of Mukasa while on the throne, there was an institutional incompatibility between the Kabakaship and the priests, and the two could never be combined (cf. Kaggwa [1901] 1971: 56-59).',\n",

Kaggwa explains that the ceremony originated during the reign of one of the early kings, Kabaka Ttembo. Ttembo fell ill and became violently insane ( eddalu ). This type of illness is not uncommon in Buganda today, and it is greatly feared because of its intensity. Eddalu is one of several ‚Äústrong‚Äù maladies that are said to be sent by human beings (through witchcraft) or by spirits; it is thought to be treatable only by Ganda medicines and is rarely cured (Orley 1970: 4ff). The dynastic accounts say that Ttembo tried several remedies before going to his uncle Nankere, who consulted a doctor. The doctor told Nankere to ‚Äúput his medicine [ edagala; literally, ‚Äòleaves‚Äô] into the back tendons of a human being, which were made into anklets and put on the legs‚Äù (Kaggwa [1901] 1971: 19). Kakoma‚Äôs account says that the medicine was in fact sewn into the tendons (1959: 11). Henceforth, the anklets became part of the installation regalia of Ttembo‚Äôs successors. As Audrey Richards has pointed, out, the ceremony at Nankere‚Äôs was one of doctoring the king and endowing him with strength (1966: 35), specifically fortifying him against the dreaded eddalu, so that the Kabaka ‚Äúwill have a long life ( aliwangaala )‚Äù (Kakoma, Ntate, and Serukaga 1959: 11).',\n",

In northern Bulemeezi county near Buganda‚Äôs northeastern frontier with Bunyoro and Busoga stood the shrine of lubaale Kawumpuli, the god of the plague (Frontispiece).

These people were arrested on the roads to the capital and taken under military escort across the Nyoro border, together with animal victims: a cow, a goat, and a fowl. After the victims‚Äô legs were broken so they could not return, the military escort carried out a punitive raid on Bunyoro and returned with captives and cattle.',\n",

DEATH from natural causes rarely presented itself to the native mind as a feasible explanation for the end of life; illness was much more likely to be the result of malice finding vent in magical art. Death was the outcome of sickness which the skill and art of the medicine-man had failed to overcome. Sometimes the cause of sickness could be traced to the direct influence of a ghost which would not be propitiated: or again it might be that the god Walumbe had need of a person, and accordingly nothing could save him. If we bear these general observations in mind, we shall be better able to understand the customs attending sickness and death, and the treatment of the native by the medicine-man. Any illness of the King was generally attributed to ghosts, because no human being would dare to practise magic upon him; when anything was the matter with him, the whole country was afraid lest he should die, and everyone did what in him lay to hasten his recovery. When the King fell sick, he was said to have a cold (senyiga), and this pretence was kept up during the whole time that his illness lasted, unless it was proved that he had some stomach trouble. All the skill in the land was at his disposal and all the priests of the gods of the land came together to diagnose his disorder. If he died, he was supposed to have offended one of the gods by robbing the temple; or else his death was thought to have been caused by one of the ghosts. The only living people whom the King feared were the widows of his father who had sons whom they wished to see on the throne. Influenced by such fears he made these widows prisoners as soon as he ascended the throne, and kept them in strict confinement until their sons died. This was the former custom, but in more recent times the King was wont to capture all the princes and had them put to death, in order to ensure peace: in the case of King Mutesa his Mother took this step for him, and put the princes to death by starvation.',\n",

When a man fell sick, his wife immediately consulted the nearest medicine-man, who came, and by consulting the oracle was able to tell what was the cause of the sickness, and also FIG. 19.‚ÄîCUPPING HORNS AND BURNING IRONS. to prescribe for the patient. If he was suffering from headache only, the usual remedy was to bleed him, in order to relieve him of the alien matter introduced into his head by means of magic, or by some ghost. When the cup was removed, the blood was poured into a leaf, and examined by the medicine-man, who invariably found something which had been drawn out in the cupping-process to account for the headache. The method of cupping was to apply one, and sometimes two cups, as the case demanded: these were short ends of horns, generally the tips of cows‚Äô horns about three inches long; at the tip a small hole was made, to create a vacuum. The medicine-man shaved the hair from the side of the head, if he meant to cup the head; washed the place with water; took a sharp knife and made a number of scratches or slight incisions; again wetted the place over the scratches, applied the cup to the head, and sucked out the air, having in his mouth a little plug of leaf or grass, which he put into the hole, while still sucking out the air. For headache he usually cupped in two places, one on either side of the head. Cupping was practised for headache, for coughs (when they cupped the lungs on the back), for deep seated abscesses in the arms and legs, and sometimes for pleurisy in the side. The horns were left on the patient, until the medicine-man thought that he had drawn enough blood. In other kinds of illness the medicine-man who threw the pieces of leather 1 See below, pp. 338, 339. was consulted, and prescribed for the patient. A man‚Äôs wife was required to send messengers to his clan, to let them know that he was unwell, whereupon some members of the clan would go at once to nurse him. Though the wife was looked upon as head nurse, she dared not be left alone with the patient, lest‚Äîin the event of his dying‚Äîthe members of his clan should bring an accusation against her of having caused his death. The remedies applied were often herbs which skilled medicine-men had found useful, for though a medicine-man worked magic, yet he also administered drugs, and did his utmost to relieve the sick person, and to retain his own reputation as a doctor. In some kinds of illness it was thought advisable to apply a small burning iron, made of three pieces of iron about a quarter of an inch thick and four inches long, which were welded together at one end, and pointed to a spike fitting into a wooden handle, so that it could be put into the fire, and made quite hot, and applied to the place where the pain was. Three blisters were usually made, which were supposed to give relief, and above all to drive out the cause of the pain. For fever the medicine-men administered herbs, which had to be drunk from one of the fetiches; this was said to increase their potency. Phthisis was always said to be caused by the ghost of some ancestor who had died of the complaint, and unless the ghost could be propitiated, it would kill the patient. The expectorations from such a person were greatly dreaded as being a channel for the ghost‚Äôs malign influence over any one who came into contact therewith.',\n",

       "  'passage': 'A Exorcising ghosts. A Unfaithfulness on the part of a husband a cause of sickness. A Infants‚Äô sickness. When the patient was said to be possessed by a ghost, it was exorcised by making the patient inhale smoke. Sometimes the entire hut was fumigated with herbs, slowly burned in a pot in the closed house. This was done to smoke out evil influences of any kind. A common cause of sickness was neglect of the graves of ancestors; the ghosts were then angry, and had to be propitiated before the remedies of the medicine-man would be of any avail. Women were often said to suffer because some man had fallen in love with them, had made advances to them which they had repelled, and had then gone away and worked magic on them. Sometimes a husband had been unfaithful, when he should have been keeping a continence-taboo; in such a case the medicine-man took some of the urine from each of the offending parties, mixed with herbs, and rubbed it on the chest of the sick woman, after which the ordinary remedies would avail. Again, a husband might be jealous of his wife because she was admired by a superior chief; in such a case he feared to adopt the usual flogging remedy, and therefore used magic and caused her to fall ill. Infants (it was thought) were born delicate because the mother had eaten some kind of forbidden food prior to the child‚Äôs birth, and broken a taboo, and the penalty was visited upon the child in the shape of skin disease (munyu), or swelling in its side (nyonyi). The bones of some bird prescribed by the medicine-man were obtained, and either pounded and mixed with herbs or boiled and given to the child to drink, and this formed the remedy. Sometimes children were troubled by the ghost of the father‚Äôs sister; it had to be appeased if possible, and, if that was impossible, it was caught by the medicine-man in a gourd or pot and secured, and taken away to a plot of waste land or drowned in the river. The reason which was assigned for the ghost of an aunt troubling the children was that her brother had neglected to appoint one of their number as the heir and successor to the deceased sister; the ghost accordingly was angry, and caused the children to fall ill. It was the common belief that, as soon as a girl had been appointed as heir, the ghost would cease to trouble the family. Amakiro was another illness common to children caused by the father having had intercourse with one of his other wives before he had completed the taboos with the mother of the child, or by his having committed adultery. Again, if the mother of the child committed adultery, either before the child was born or while she was nursing it, the child would contract this disease. The sickness was characterised by nausea and general debility, which nothing would cure until the guilty persons had confessed their guilt and performed the kukansira 1 See p. 72. ceremony. A woman who was subject to miscarriage was said to have a hot inside, and she had to be treated for it by the medicine-man, or the miscarriage might be the result of adultery. If the husband gave any clothing to his mother or to her sisters and they placed it upon his wife‚Äôs bed, it would cause her to fall ill of a sickness called buko . Bubonic plague, which had been known for many years, was more feared than any other sickness. The inhabitants fled from the place at once when it appeared, and sought the aid of the god of plague to stay it. People immediately became alarmed and fled from a place if they found rats dead or dying. Small-pox was also feared, though the patients were seldom isolated; they were treated and nursed in their homes. This disease was generally contracted by men engaged on a war expedition, and was supposed to be caused by the enemy. During his illness the patient was given water in which fish had been boiled to quench his thirst, or water mixed with butter, which kept his throat moist. An egg was rubbed over the eyes daily to prevent him from becoming blind; and when the pox formed, they were pricked with a thorn taken from the tip of the palm leaf, and then wiped with a sponge made from the stem of the plantain.',\n",

In front of his main entrance a wide space was cleared, varying in size according to his rank, but often two hundred yards square; this was kept free from weeds or grass.

The rivers, owing to the growth in them of papyrus and grass, often formed large swamps, sometimes several miles wide, and it became necessary to make paths of raised earth through them, with bridges thrown over the actual streams. If the streams were too wide for the people to bridge, they had to make a long detour till they could find a place sufficiently narrow to bridge. Sometimes no such place could be found, and then the only thing done was to break down the papyrus stems over their own roots, and so form a precarious bridge. To cross a stream upon this kind of bridge was not always safe for travellers; frequently people lost their footing, and were drowned. In all the larger streams there were currents of water under the roots of the papyrus; so that if a person made a false step, and went down, he was caught by the current, and was almost certain to lose his life, because the roots prevented him from rising to the surface. Such accidents were attributed to the Spirit of the River, and no one attempted to assist a person who had gone under, because it was thought that the Spirit needed him, and would wreak vengeance upon the would-be rescuer.',\n",

Hence it behoved the living, and especially the relations upon whom the care and welfare of the ghosts depended, to be ever watchful for their interests; otherwise the ghosts would retaliate and cause illness and death in the clan. A favourite place of the ghosts was among the trees and plantains in the gardens, where they made sport, especially at noon when the sun shone brightly; on this account children were warned against going out to play in the gardens during the heat of the day, and even adults did not enter them at this time, unless they were obliged to do so. When the wind blew softly and murmured in the leaves of the trees, the ghosts were said to be talking to one another, and when a whirlwind occurred and carried up the dust and the leaves the ghosts were said to be at play. Ghosts hung about the graves in which their bodies lay buried; nothing would induce them to go far away from the spot except the removal of the body or of some particular portion of it. The special portion of the body to which a ghost clung was the lower jawbone (lwanga); when once this was taken away the ghost would follow it to the ends of the earth, and would be quite satisfied to remain with the jawbone if it were honoured. This supposed knowledge of the way to control a ghost has been acted upon for many years; there are jawbones of men, who lived nearly a thousand years ago, preserved to this day by members of the clan to which they belonged; and they are regarded as a most precious heirloom.

On this account, whenever the King sent to rob or plunder people, they would escape to the nearest of these hills, and wait there until the King withdrew his party; both they and their goods would be safe as soon as they reached the sacred hill. At Gaga on the Boa hill there was a temple in charge of a priestess Kalambika, and also a female medium Bakima . No King was permitted to visit Boa, but all were compelled to stop short at the foot of the hill. It is related that King Mawanda wished to build his capital on the hill, but, after crossing the stream, he suddenly became blind, and remained so during his stay there, though, when he left the hill, he immediately recovered his sight. From that time onwards the hill has been regarded as sacred. On the hill there was a sacred forest, into which no one except the priest was permitted to enter. A broad path ran round the hill, and was kept in good repair by the chief of the district. If the chief allowed it to become overgrown with grass and weeds, and a grass fire caught any of the trees or the grass in the forest, the medium (it was said) would fall ill with burning sores. The chief would, under such circumstances, be fined for neglecting the road and allowing the fire to enter the forest.

The chief gave to his principal wife two cows in token of his promotion to the chief‚Äôs office; he also visited a number of places believed to be the abodes of ghosts, and propitiated them; at Muruli he offered a hoe to the ghost. At Mpumude he was given a woman to wife, and from there he returned to Boa, where he sat on a certain stone, while his wives were brought and introduced to him as though he did not know them. He was then given a pipe by the priestess Kalambika, which he smoked; afterwards he made a tour through the district, passing the grave of Matumpagwe .',\n",

Only the most skilled medicine-man could make fetiches; herbs had to be carefully selected, and other materials were needed, such as the hearts of lions, leopards, crocodiles, elephants, buffaloes, and other animals, which (it was supposed) would make the owner brave and strong. These materials were pounded together and stuffed into the horns, or they were mixed with clay, made into fetiches, and dedicated by the medicine-man to different gods. They thus became identified with a supernatural being, and in consequence they were possessed by the gods, and were powerful and effective. The secret of making these fetiches was confined to a small number of medicine-men who never divulged it to others, unless they themselves were to reap some benefit by the communication. The people believed that these objects had supernatural powers, they paid large sums of money for them, and treated them with the utmost respect and reverence.',\n",

As charms they were used chiefly for the prevention of disease; their medicinal properties had brought them into notoriety, and they were afterwards regarded as possessing powers to avert the evil which they had originally been meant to cure. One amulet partook of the nature of a fetich, it was called Luzalo, and was designed to insure fecundity. It consisted of a piece of wood, often sewn into a small cat-skin bag, at times decorated with cowry-shells, and worn tied round the waist, so that the amulet rested in front of the wearer. Other amulets having the same purpose were small packets of powdered herbs, which were worn by the woman round her waist; some of the powder would be mixed with water, and drunk from time to time.

They first washed the bowels, and then gently forced them back into position, next they cut a gourd, and fitted a piece of it over the bowels inside the flesh, and then they bound up the wound, and it soon healed; sometimes they had to enlarge the wound before they could force the bowels back, and after these were brought into position they inserted a piece of gourd to protect them, and stitched it up in the wound.

Some of my informants agreed that it could be brought by a ghost ( muzimu ) which is the agency bringing kigalanga, but the great majority thought it was a typical symptom of eyabwe . ). During this illness the child may shudder with feverish rigors, or even have convulsions. It is interesting in this context to note the fairly frequent reports by patients that their child had such an illness, but that it was only after convulsions had recurred in the absence of fever that they realised that it was suffering from epilepsy. It is probable that in some cases the fever has been associated with brain damage and the subsequent development of epilepsy, whilst in other cases it has precipitated epilepsy in a person already predisposed, and in whom epilepsy was very likely to appear anyway. The word eyabwe itself means ‚Äòtheirs‚Äô (the children‚Äôs) and refers to the fact that it is thought to be brought by ‚Äútheir bird‚Äù ( ennyonyi eyabwe ), which is an eagle. This is a reference to the suddenness of the onset of the illness, just as a bird of prey swoops down to catch its prey, and also to the fact that during a convulsion the eyes turn up as if to see the bird flying above them. If such a bird is seen the women with the children may shout up at it ‚Äú Omukulu, mukulu mukulu . . . .‚Äù ‚Äúthe child is an old one, old enough to be fetching water‚Äù, hoping to deceive the bird into thinking that the child is too old to be attacked. There are various other preventive measures, such as the tying of a small bell on to the left wrist, the noise of which will frighten the bird, or attract the mother‚Äôs attention if the child moves to fend it off (Note 11 Note ‚Äî Bennett (1963, p. 157) also noted this. Roscoe (1911, p. 101) says that nyonyi was a swelling in the side of an infant caused by the mother eating forbidden food during pregnancy. He almost certainly confused the name with that of another illness. Aall-Jilek (1965) says that the Wapogoro believe certain birds should not be killed, especially the fish eagle, because it circles and then drops to the earth like an epileptic in an attack. ). Eyabwe can also refer to ‚Äútheir insect‚Äù which lives in the ground ( eyabwe eya wansi ), usually a spider ( nnabubi ). Cases of eyabwe caused by this insect turn their eyes down instead of up during a convulsion (a rare enough occurrence to make this a rather unusual form of the illness).',\n",

The Baganda imply certain things when they refer to illnesses as Kiganda. They think of them as ‚Äòstrong‚Äô illnesses and they are usually sent by another, although there are many exceptions. There are traditional forms of therapy for them although in these days the traditional art of healing is thought to have been largely lost. Western medicine is not considered to be particularly effective in treating such illnesses. The underlying feeling is that Europeans know how to treat their own diseases (non-Kiganda ones, sometimes called ez‚Äôekizungu, ‚Äúthose of the Europeans‚Äù). Those illnesses which are untreatable by western medicine or are difficult to treat, as in the case with mental illness, are thought therefore to be Kiganda diseases, and are of course strong since traditional forms of therapy are not often very useful either. The fact that the Government provides free medical treatment means that often people attend Government clinics in the first instance before trying traditional methods of healing. Since most people get better from mild illnesses despite medicine or with very simple treatment, this ensures the perpetuation of the image of Western medicine being effective for ‚Äòweak‚Äô illnesses. Europeans are renowned for insisting that illnesses are not brought by witchcraft, but because of the tendency to polarise these notions this means that Kiganda illnesses are those that are so brought. There are other reasons for strong Kiganda illnesses being thought to be brought by witchcraft. Madness, epilepsy and the other strong illnesses bring an enormous amount of trouble to a patient and his family and usually tend to follow a chronic course extending over many years, if not a lifetime. In order to cope with such a stressful situation, an explanatory model (paranoid in nature) is formulated by the family, which apart from helping them to talk about the illness, also absolves them from blame and opens up a course of action. No one bothers to use such a model when referring to a cold, but the ‚Äòstrong‚Äô diseases are almost always said to be sent. It does mean, however, that if someone within a family suffers from a strong illness considerable suspicions arise and back-biting can occur.',\n",

There are several works available which include chapters on the traditional beliefs of the Baganda and so it is only necessary to summarise these and in places to clarify the picture. The Baganda believe in several forms of spirits; balubaale (hero-gods), mayembe (literally meaning horns, but referring to spirits residing in horns or other receptacles), mizimu (the ghosts of dead ancestors), misambwa (spirits associated with certain animals, rivers, rocks or forests) and kitambo (a spirit usually causing people to walk naked at night and eat dead bodies). Difficulties arise when discussing the cause of illnesses with patients and their families as Bennett et al. (1964) discovered when asking about childhood diarrhoea. Although relatives admitted that a possible cause was obusobe, a ritual mistake made in pregnancy or infancy ( obusobya, a mistake) none admitted that this was the reason for their own child‚Äôs diarrhoea. The Baganda do, in fact, have a proverb ‚ÄòLubaale agoba nsonga‚Äô nga takutidde wuwo . (A Lubaale punishes with reason, provided that it has not killed one of your own relatives).

They may also bring continued misfortune to a family. This forces the family to attend the doctor to find the cause of the illness or misfortune. The serving of balubaale runs in families and theoretically it can be excluded as a cause of illness in those families which have never had members serving in the past, although it is relatively rare to find such a family.

       "  'passage': 'The method of treatment for both mayembe and mizimu is to induce the spirit to speak through the victim and identify itself so that a medicine may be prepared or the person who sent it may be induced to remove it. I was called to see an elderly woman who had had severe stomach ache. She was surrounded by women neighbours who had covered her head with a cloth and were giving her inhalations of burning peppers in order to make things so unpleasant for the spirit that it would reveal itself. At the time of my arrival she was extremely agitated and was making a series of incoherent barking noises and did indeed seem possessed in some way. From lack of time and out of consideration for her son who had taken me there I was obliged to interrupt the proceedings. Palpation of her stomach revealed that there was no gross illness. I therefore reassured her and those around that she was recovering and gave her the only medicine I had with me at the time, a tranquillizer tablet (chlorpromazine 100 mgm). She apparently made a quick and uneventful recovery with no recurrence. The interruption, however, had made some of the women neighbours angry because it had prevented the act being played out to the full. The true diagnosis therefore could not be made, since it was assumed that the spirit had been about to reveal itself. It is quite likely that her barking would have become coherent enough for some, possibly cryptic, information to have been gathered from it. This kind of an attack by a muzimu is known as kigalanga . Mair (Note 27 Note ‚Äî Mair (1934, p. 226). An account of the capturing of mizimu by causing the patient to vomit them into a gourd is given by Kagwa (1934, p. 126). Ssekamwa (1967, p. 37) also describes a case of the capture of mayembe . The involuntary shivering which comes with fever may be interpreted as empewo which means a cold wind and so by extension a ghost. Dr. J. Bennett tells me that the word is also used occasionally for cases of kwashiorkor in infants. The Baganda recognise that this comes following the weaning of the child. The body swells and because of this the skin feels cold so that it is thought that the illness is due to the child getting cold at night now that it is separated from the mother. The word empewo in this context merely means that the child gets cold and does not refer to the extended meaning of a ghost. The illness is properly known as obwosi and also as omusana, the sun, because the stretched pale skin shines like the sun. ) says that ‚Äúthe spirit is supposed to enter the stomach by the mouth and cause a kind of indigestion known as kigalanga, whose first symptom is said to be a very cold feeling. This is regarded as the manifestation par excellence of spirit possession . . .‚Äù Indeed the word empewo is used for both a spirit and a cold wind. A muzimu can attack people of either sex seizing them by the throat and killing them instantly. In the case of kigalanga however time is available to treat the condition, and ‚Äúthe first thing to do on such an occasion is to ‚Äòmake the spirit speak‚Äô.‚Äù (Mair, ibid).',\n",

       "  'passage': 'When people become mad they behave in a way quite out of keeping with their usual personality, as if they had become another person. Similarly, during an epileptic fit it seems as if the patient has become possessed by some outside force and is no longer able to control his actions. It would therefore seem quite reasonable to think of both conditions as being caused by spirits which take control of the patient‚Äôs body, causing him to behave in a strange way. If people are asked what brought a strong illness the immediate answer is usually ‚Äúthey bewitched him‚Äù, but this may well be modified if a further explanation is asked for. As has been noted, there are two principal types of spirits. The first include the balubaale and the family mayembe . These are very human in nature and their object is to encourage people to work for them in different ways. They would therefore never kill or produce a bad chronic illness unless the patient and his family had ignored their requests. This could be because of religious scruples or other beliefs opposed to the idea of appeasing spirits or simply because of laziness or lack of money. The second principal type of spirits include the muzimu and the mayembe ag‚Äôekifalu . These come to kill and are likely to produce a rather violent or unpleasant illness. At first sight therefore, an epileptic fit would appear to be brought by these latter since it is a rather violent and horrifying episode. There is something rather inhuman about a fit and this accords with the idea that it is produced by mayembe ag‚Äôekifalu, who cannot be conversed with like the balubaale . Those possessed by a lubaale or who have an illness caused by one, remain like human beings. On one occasion I was told that a madman, who was confused but not violent, was probably affected by a lubaale because it was ‚Äòtreating him nicely‚Äô. In the case of epilepsy, however, it is recognised that no spirit would be so inept as to fail to kill the patient every time it came. When talking in general terms it may be said that epilepsy is brought by mayembe, but when actually confronted by a case in the family, relatives are much more uncertain about the cause.',\n",

       "  'passage': 'There is a difference of opinion as to which of the spirits is the most dangerous. The mayembe are sent to kill but their effects can be countered by medicine, even western medicine. The balubaale usually produce illnesses which are not susceptible to medicine but require the process of ‚Äòsettling‚Äô. A visit to hospital will only bring temporary remission and on return home it will not be long before the illness recurs. Thus, although less violent, the illnesses the balubaale produce are more difficult to cure and consequently many say that they are the most dangerous (Note 28 Note ‚Äî It must be emphasised that ideas of causation are vague and it is impossible to draw up an ordered system. Ssekamwa (1967, p. 35) gives an account of a man who was affected by mayembe ag‚Äôekifalu who went mad. He got better in a few days in Butabika Hospital but relapsed on discharge. ). It has been pointed out by others, and I would agree, that western doctors, when confronted with an illness supposedly brought by witchcraft, should not argue with the patient about the causation. It is usually quite acceptable that there may be a western medicine to cure him. This is not entirely unlike the attitudes of many western patients to medical treatment.',\n",

       "  'passage': 'Amongst the Baganda, as in many other parts of Africa, there is a great fear of a triad of diseases. These are epilepsy ( ensimbu ), leprosy ( ebigenge ) and consumption ( akafuba, usually translated tuberculosis). It was known that I was treating epilepsy and because these illnesses are closely associated in the minds of the Baganda, I was approached on several occasions for treatment for leprosy. The Baganda believe all three to be highly infectious. In epilepsy the froth from the mouth and the urine which may be passed during a fit are thought of as particular carriers of the disease, but the sufferers are also thought to be able to spread the illness at all times and not only during a fit. The diagnosis of epilepsy is usually correct when people have been said to have ensimbu, but any chronic cough or skin disease will be feared to be akafuba and ebigenge respectively. All three illnesses are associated with a terrible stigma but in the case of epilepsy it sometimes seems more tragic since the patient may only be incapacitated for a day or two each month and for the remainder of the time will be perfectly well. Nevertheless, because of the fear of contagion they will typically have their own plates, cups and wash basin, and their clothes are washed separately. They eat their food on their own and sleep in a room on their own and when old enough, they will live in a hut of their own, isolated from the others in the household.',\n",

An epileptic may sleep in the kitchen, which is usually a separate hut away from the main house. Any youth, however, when he is old enough to begin having sexual relations will be expected to sleep under a different roof from his parents. Children with epilepsy will not be allowed to play with others and the parents of the others will warn their own children to keep away and not to play together with them. The result of these beliefs is that when an epileptic has a fit everyone runs away. If he should fall in the fire or into water it is quite likely that no one will pull him out and he will be left to burn or drown. A few informants said that they recognised that epilepsy was not infectious and others said that the isolation they were subjected to was not only due to its supposed infectious nature, but because of the unpleasant and rather frightening nature of the fits themselves. Epileptics also tend to be dirty although in many cases this is due to their isolation and lack of the usual socialising influences. There may also be a certain amount of fear of the strange behaviour sometimes displayed by the patient on recovery from a fit.',\n",

       "  'passage': 'Belief in the infectious nature of epilepsy is widespread in Africa south of the Sahara but unfortunately, there is little literature on it. Giel (1968) reports this belief in Ethiopia, Aall-Jilek (1965) in Tanzania and Leighton and Lambo (1963) in Nigeria. I myself have heard of it in many other areas that I have visited, and it seems that few people in this area do not have such a belief (Note 34 Note ‚Äî On a brief visit to Eastern Uganda, I was told that the Karamojong did not believe epilepsy to be contagious. It should be remembered that it is ensimbu, the grand mal form of epilepsy, that is considered contagious by the Baganda. It is not surprising that Billington (1968, p. 565) found that a patient with petit mal was not stigmatised. He had not got ensimbu . ). Some Baganda believe that it can only be spread to those in the same family. This suggests that the mechanism is similar to that of the attacks of lubaale and mizimu, which are similarly limited. Indeed a few say that there are two types of epilepsy. If it has been caught from another then it may be spread to another, but if it came without the patient ever having been near anyone else with epilepsy then it may be of another variety which is not infectious. It is very often thought to be due to a lizard in the head which may either be there at birth and slowly grow until it begins to disturb the brain, or it may be introduced in later years by witchcraft. As it runs round and round in the head it causes dizziness and then the epileptic fit. A method of treatment is to cup the head and so remove it, but even this is not the final answer since the patient will still be left with a good deal of illness even if he does not actually have fits, and he will probably die soon. Even the most optimistic acknowledge that a considerable amount of further medication is required after the cupping. The belief that epilepsy is caused by witchcraft or a lizard in the head can co-exist at one and the same time with the idea that it is infectious. The idea of contagion is very non-specific and none could describe a mechanism by which it could be spread. Similarly while leprosy is thought to be contagious there is no notion of how it is spread and at the same time it may be thought to be due to witchcraft or a butterfly which touched the patient‚Äôs skin leaving a light patch of powder from its wings.',\n",

       "  'passage': 'Epilepsy is thought to lead to spoiling ( okwonooneka ) of the brain, the word okwonooneka being stronger than the English word ‚Äúspoil‚Äù and more nearly approaching the idea of destroying. The nearest analogy that people could give to what they thought was happening was that it was like butter melting in the sun. A spoilt brain may be present in those who are merely foolish, but it is also thought to be the inevitable outcome of untreated madness and epilepsy. Epilepsy is not usually thought to lead to madness but may lead to the mild form ( eddalu ly‚Äôakazoole ). Drinking large amounts of alcohol and smoking hemp also spoil the brain. There is no doubt that the social isolation which epileptics are subjected to, especially in the case of children, can lead to failure in their social development, so that the brain certainly appears spoilt. A three year old girl was brought to me by her grandmother with whom she was living. She had a three month history of fits. Her grandmother said that her brain had already begun to ‚Äòspoil‚Äô, as was shown in the way she appeared sullen and had become disobedient. Before the fits she had been sleeping in the same bed as her grandmother, but after the illness began she had to sleep on the other side of the room, and her friends were told not to play with her. Tablets were given to prevent the fits and the grandmother was told that the tablets prevented the disease from spreading, and the child was no longer to be separated. Her grandmother reported that she soon became her normal self again but unfortunately the old woman then died. The girl‚Äôs father had died two years before, so after the grandmother‚Äôs death the father‚Äôs relations started looking after the child and began again to keep her well apart from others. Not unnaturally, the little girl was greatly upset, by the death of the grandmother and this, coupled with an apparent indifference to her welfare on the part of the father‚Äôs relatives, such that everyone in the household found some reason why they were unable to attend for further medication, soon led to a recurrence of her fits and bad behaviour. This was quickly attributed to her brain being spoilt. The adults could see no alternative but that she should go to Butabika Hospital, since they were antagonistic to the mother of the girl who was presumed to have caused the death of her husband. They were eventually persuaded to let the mother take care of the child, although by custom she belonged to the father‚Äôs family. The mother was instructed in giving medicine and within a few weeks the girl was behaving like a normal child and was apparently quite obedient. Some of the bad behaviour may be due to the direct effect of the illness, but almost certainly treating a child of three in the ways mentioned above must have contributed a great deal to her misbehaviour.',\n",

In contrast to the warriors, all the occupants of the family kraal, especially since the cattle epidemics, eat vegetable food which they buy from the neighboring peoples, since they themselves do not engage in any agriculture at all. Their favorite foods, however, are, of course, milk, meat, and blood. Milk is always drunk by healthy people uncooked, as fresh ( e n gule ) or sour ( e n gule naoto ); boiled milk is food for the sick and as such is usually mixed with pulverized grains of ol lodoa (Maesa lanceolata) . Sheep milk is especially popular because of its very high fat content. Blood of cattle, sheep, and goats is drunk fresh or eaten in the clotted state. Milk mixed with fresh or 33 cooked blood ( en jiw ot ) is greatly appreciated; this drink is highly esteemed as invalid soup for the wounded. Cheese making is unknown. Butter is made by agitating the cream in a large gourd-bottle ( en diagolgol ). Fat, rendered in a pot, is used as an ingredient in other foods, especially meat broth, but is also drunk without any admixture. Meat is prepared without adding salt; it is cooked either with various spices or roasted on a stick at the open fire.

Ill. 13. Women cleaning the kraal. Albizzia anthelmintica ) always used in the cooking of meat is supposed to cause severe diarrhea. Therefore milk that is offered is often refused in the hope that a meal of meat will be obtained on the same day. One who wishes to partake of both foods in one day -- and where is there a Masai who could resist an invitation to a meal of meat?! -- vomits first before eating the meat, for which he produces the necessary stimulus by means of a blade of grass stuck in the throat. If one has eaten cooked meat today, then 34 one first drinks some blood in the morning before the milk, not out of considerations of health, but rather because it is believed that the livestock would give less milk as a consequence of neglecting this custom.

The warriors boast of alleged heroic deeds in former wars and discuss the prospects of the ones circumcised that day on their first military expedition, which will perhaps take them to this or that region, where they themselves had made an attack only a short time before. The fathers dream of their sons' future heroic deeds and are happy at the thought of the rich booty with which the budding warriors will augment the paternal herds. Suddenly the glances of a few who had just been joking darken and turn toward a distant hut at whose door a solitary old man is sitting. They jump up and go toward him with quick steps. The angry expression on their faces matches their rough and abruptly uttered invectives and threats, in which one hears the reproaches that the old man has brought up his son to be a weak coward, who during the circumcision betrayed his pain by a twitching of facial muscles and a half-suppressed groan, which tehy, however, jeeringly compare to the roar of pain of a bull being cut. The old man has quickly fled from their imprecations into his hut, and his attackers vent their wrath on two gourd bottles of hiney beer left standing, which they knock over and 63 cont. trample underfoot. The one now scorned had also wanted 64 to regale guests with it on that day, but no one came to him whose son showed himself to be a t or on o . While the old people, as long as there is something to eat and drink, are only interested in that, the warriors, already early in the afternoon, start to dance and sing with the young girls and amuse themselves in this way into the night. Not until about ten o'clock do they go back to their kraal, to which the girls presently follow them, after they have begged for a little more milk, which they take along to their lovers. /Ill. 18 appears here./\",\n",

The shorn hair is tossed into the thorn fence of the kraal. Beard hair and such lashes that grow back into the eye are plucked out with tweezers (Fig. 63 [ ol bud et ]).

Somewhat later it is twisted together into strands ( ol babet, el babet ) with red paint, a mixture of animal fat and red earth, which hang entangled around the head. Furthermore they are lengthened by twisting in fibers of the bark of the baobab ( ol m es er a ) and of another tree called ol ret√©ti , in order to form out of that the braid-coiffure peculiar to the Masai warriors, but adopted by many neighboring tribes (Fig. 64, 65, 66 [ ol daiga, el daigan ]).

The back hair, lengthened up to 50 centimeters, is placed around a foot-long stick and on this wrapped tightly with bast or goat leather scraped thin, so that it forms a stiff braid ( ol daiga ) reaching to the waist. Over this braid one not infrequently finds one to three smaller ones.

       "  'passage': 'Of foreign bodies one finds in wounds arrow points most frequently. Taking them out, is certainly more difficult than to take out other foreign bodies, and it will therefore suffice to discuss the method used for this, since those for the removal of more harmless objects will follow from that. First of all, it leads to an operation, of course, only if -- which is seldom the case -- the arrow is not poisoned or if -- which fortunately often occurs -- the poison has become ineffective through decomposition. Since in battle the torso as a rule is protected by shield and beside the leather cape also often deflects the arrow or at any rate greatly diminishes its force, deeper arrow wounds usually occur occur only on the extremities. If the entire arrow remains stuck in the wound, the operator knows immediately, without a lengthy examination, where the point rests and how it lies. If there are only muscles lying in front of the point in the direction of the shot, he quickly pushes the arrow through and draws out point and tang on the other side, the shaft on the shot-entry side. On the other hand, if bones lie in front of the arrow point, this method is automatically eliminated. Simply pulling out the arrow through the shot-entry 194 cont. opening is, however, impossible because of the barbs. The surgeon now has two methods. Which one he will employ depends upon the individual case. He either twists the arrow around in the wound until the barbs have become so filled and coated with muscle fibers that they are no longer 195 able to offer resistance to a pull backwards, or he treats the arrow like a broken-off one, for which he has the following ways of operating. The point palpable by contact from the outside is removed in such a manner that one makes on the shortest path between it and the skin an incision as wide as is necessary in order to permit drawing it through. Since no forceps are at the disposal of the operator, but rather he must grasp with his fingers the arrow point to be removed, the incision must be quite large. A hidden point is sought in the following manner: the surgeon inserts his finger into the shot-entry channel and cuts through at the end of the fingertips from the outside inward, then sticks his finger into this opening and gropes farther into the shot channel, in order to make a second incision where his fingertip now lies. It goes on in this manner until he has reached the arrow point with his finger. If only muscles now lie in front of it, it is pushed forward with the finger in the direction of the shot, until it emerges. If a bone blocks this path, however, the operator either forces the arrow point away from its direction and toward the outside, or he cuts toward the arrow point from the outside in order, as described above, to remove it by way of this new channel.',\n",

He therefore did not see which of his sons was before him and gave to Lenana the insignia of the medicine-man (the iron club and the medicine horn, the gourd, the stones 1 It is possible that these stones, which according to tradition were brought many years ago from the north, may prove to be of some interest. It is asserted that no European has ever been allowed to behold them. , and the bag), at the same time saying: ‚ÄòThou shalt be great amongst thy brothers and amongst all the people.‚Äô Ne'ya Ol- Onana 'n-d okitin o-'l-oiboni, nelo. | Lenana took the medicine-man's insignia and went away.

The official version is that Lenana was chosen by the elders of most of the clans and districts on his father's death, but that Sendeyo refused to acknowledge him, and was supported by the 'L-oitai (i. e. the Masai of the 'L-oita sub-district, near Kilima Njaro), with whom he lived for many years. The warriors of the two parties frequently met in deadly strife, and raided each other's cattle. In 1902 Sendeyo gave up the hopeless conflict, and agreed to acknowledge his brother as chief. He now lives not far from Naivasha. Lenana himself says that he and his three brothers Sendeyo, Neliang, and Tolito were examined by their father a short time before the latter's death, and as he possessed a better knowledge of the work of the medicine-men than his brothers, he was given the iron club, &c., and chosen by the elders as Mbatian's successor. .

N eara Ol- Onana o Send eu 'l-arin kumok, n eari Send eu, nel otu te-'lle-ari le-√±gole asai ol-alashe, neishori eton aaboita, neitayu o-s otwa. | The two rivals waged war for many years, and eventually Sendeyo was beaten.

A messenger was sent by Lenana to the Government authorities at Nairobi, and when crossing the Uganda Railway he was overtaken by a train. He jumped on one side and saved his life, but dropped the club, which was never found again. Its place was taken for some years by a small iron poker, but another club has now been made. . If the medicine-man sends a messenger to tell his people anything, he also sends his club so that it may be known that the message comes from him.

       "  'passage': \"There are two interpretations of the healthy appearance of Maasai. The popular view is to note the excellence of their diet and way of life by normal African standards (Orr and Gilks 1931). The more sombre view is to accept that only the most robust children have a chance of survival and natural selection is a major factor in the level of health (Merker 1904:334). The true balance between these is hard to assess. The Matapato are reluctant to discuss family tragedies and they dispose of dead children unobtrusively. The general absence of congenital disabilities inevitably raises questions regarding the fate of defective babies. 3 The term en-tomononi refers most commonly to a young mother whose hair reveals her ritual state, but it also applies to certain other ritualised roles including the infant itself. Apart from emphasising the weakness of her condition, informants offered no derivation of this term. In the related language Bari, however, a phonetically similar term, tomunyan , is translated as ‚Äôtenderness, feebleness, weakness‚Äô (Spagnolo 1960:300). In its male form, ol-tomononi may refer to a generally propitious elder with children, who is especially suitable for a prominent role in any ceremony. It is held that any deformity could indicate some past sin dogging either parent, but God condoned this birth and God alone should choose the moment of death. As children are progressively exposed to the outside world, those that are maladapted are less likely to survive, but still a few may do so and even live to raise healthy families of their own. It is God's will, they say.\",\n",

       "  'passage': \"As the time for moving from their temporary villages to the eunoto site draws near, the manyat are joined by non-manyata moran and they migrate as a whole age-group. The apprehensiveness of sorcery surrounding this move helps to build up a sense of occasion. The eunoto site itself is kept secret so that it cannot be tampered with beforehand. A protective line of chalky ‚Äòmedicine‚Äô provided by the Prophet is traced on every forehead from ear to ear for the move. There is also a false start to divert misfortune from the migration proper that follows. This is a theme that is repeated later that day with the installation of the ritual leader, for he too is thought to divert misfortune from his age mates who follow him to elderhood. This concern with threats from sinister forces coincides with the transformation that the age-group of moran undergo through eunoto . It marks an implicit shift in the distribution of power with age more generally. The juxtaposition of large numbers of older men and younger men sharply differentiated by age highlights their differences. The maturation of the moran is a fact of life that arouses ambivalence, clearly expressed in Episode 2 and other incidents of the kind. Even the firestick patrons, whose future is ritually linked with that of their moran wards, have a vested interest in delaying the reality of the present. This is to suggest that the kind of insight offered by some informants, that the danger from ‚Äòeyes‚Äô emanates from society at large, could logically be extended to interpreting the dangers that are felt to surround eunoto . Episode 4 . Seizing the ritual leaders . The migration to the eunoto site had to take place on the fifth day of a Maasai lunar month, reckoned from the morning when the old moon was no longer visible (24th April 1977). When the time came, moran feasting in the forest nearby were summoned and the number in the villages increased overnight from about 100 moran to perhaps 450. This was the first time that the whole age-group had ever been assembled in one spot. Forty-nine of the moran were selected to lead the procession. Singing emosiroi , they were followed by a herd of forty-eight white heifers and a young black bull, and then by all the other moran. They were blessed by a manyata-mother, who dipped a handful of grass into a milk gourd and flicked milk at them as they passed through her gateway and out of the larger village. This was the false start, and when all the moran had passed out, the patrons ordered them to disband. (Coining the metaphor, the ritual rebirth had been aborted.) The procession proper had to wait until the manyata-mothers packed their donkeys and had left to be at the eunoto site before the moran. During this lull, the patrons directed the moran to process between the villages performing their lion dance. Some patrons, who were trying to slow down the tempo, were visibly moved, two with tears down their cheeks. It was the lion dance, I was told, that stirred their memories - and it was being performed too fast. In other respects, the patrons clearly showed that they had total control and were determined to dominate this occasion. Throughout the day they marshalled the moran for instruction, for dancing, and for the chores of moving, and one or two lashed out with their long whips on impulse. The moran seemed drained of their earlier confidence, for the migration was a prelude to the evening climax when the identities of the ritual leader and his deputy would be revealed. Later, several moran described to me their feelings of apprehension on this day: a dread of the approach of evening and of the awful possibility that they themselves or perhaps one of their close friends might be seized as a ritual leader. One moran whose ancestry made him ineligible expressed his own vicarious fears. Whoever they were, two of his age mates were to be plucked away, violating the manyata bond of sharing in everything including a common destiny. The ritual leaders were to be condemned to an uncertain future, even an early death, and he felt as though a part of his own self was condemned. Eventually all was packed for the migration. The procession was led by a few firestick patrons who knew the secret location, a spot about four miles further south. Then came the manyata-mothers with their laden donkeys, some straggled from time to time, and others stopped to readjust their loads, halting the procession that followed. Then came the remaining patrons, and at their rear a few with whips to control the pace of the moran, so that they did not overtake the straggling women. Then came the moran in four files, two for Maparasha and one each for Meto and Silale, wearing such lionskin trophies and ostrich feather headdresses as they had. They carried their shields, held high their manyata flags, and raised their spears to the rhythm of their lion dance. Each time the procession was halted by the patrons, the dancing would intensify and minor epidemics of shaking broke out: a yelp, some shaking, and then more yelps and more shaking. Possibly thirty of the moran shook, while many more were shivering. Finally at the tailend of the procession, came a file of about thirty girls, escorted by four moran. By the time that the body of the procession arrived at the eunoto site, the women had already been directed by the leading firestick patrons to build their huts in a large circle. This was the point, incidentally at which the violent eunoto affray had erupted in Purko in 1945 when rival manyat competed for the prime position in the village. In Matapato, there was no prime position to be fought over; and here in any event, manyata rivalries appeared to have dissipated before the migration. When the moran arrived, they were directed to fetch logs for the fire and to cut thorn branches for the village fence. In a matter of hours an unremarkable stretch of open bushland overshadowed by the mountain was transformed into a joint manyata village. Meanwhile, the patrons blessed the forty-nine young cattle in the centre of the village; and then holding down the young black bull, they kindled the manyata fire on his back. The manner of lighting this fire is popularly related to the misfortune that dogs the ritual leader. According to one version, it is the unpropitiousness of lighting it on a living bull that has the effect of a firestick patrons' curse. According to another it is ‚Äòmedicine‚Äô provided by the Prophet which they put in the flames that has the effect of sorcery. 3 The fracas concerned respectively the Ngorisho R among the Loodokilani, the Meruturud L and the Nyankusi R among the Purko. The Annual Report for 1945 (AR/Kaj-Nar/1945:3) presumably refers obliquely to this last incident. Various moran looked on, aware that their patrons were performing an essential preliminary to installing the two incumbents in a matter of hours. As the shadows lengthened and the new moon was just visible, all the huts had been erected and the moran were called to the village. Most of them were quickly rounded up, but some were found lurking in the bush nearby, apparently hoping that their absence would not be noticed. There were rumours that several had already run away. Once assembled, the moran were mustered round the patrons' fire, singing emosiroi and facing inwards in a double circle, about thirty yards in diameter with a pathway between the outer and inner rings. Then further delays prolonged the suspense when it was discovered that some of the manyata-mothers had not yet taken a flame from the patrons' fire to kindle their own hearths. This prompted a routine check on all huts. Eventually the patrons were satisfied that the procedure for seizing the two ritual leaders could continue. A posse wearing capes and consisting of the three moran spokesmen and four strong aides ambled round the pathway between the two rings. They glanced over the moran as they passed, and were poised at any moment to seize the ritual leader. In the gathering twilight, they continued to circumambulate for perhaps twenty minutes while the other moran continued the slow measured tones of emosiroi with tense shivery expressions. One or two yelped and started to shake from time to time. As darkness closed in, it only became clear that the posse had seized the ritual leader when there was a cry and a scuffle. Other moran near the spot joined in to hold him, while a woman's apron was forced over his shoulders. Shivering, screaming, and throwing his limbs violently in all directions, he was half dragged and half carried to his mother's hut and forced to sit beside her fire opposite three firestick patrons. For a time he continued to scream and seemed almost delirious, while his mother and his young brother, who was a manyata herdboy, were also overcome with grief. About fifteen of his closer moran friends gathered, singing to comfort him, and a cow with male calf was tethered in front of the hut as a gift from his age-group. The commotion eventually subsided and the moran were again assembled into their rings to sing emosiroi ; and the same procedure was followed to seize and instal the deputy ritual leader. Once this too had been completed, the circle was finally broken. With a sense of general relief there was dancing and high spirits in various parts of the village, by groups of moran with their girls, and also by manyata-mothers in their own groups. For the first time that day, the festive atmosphere returned and continued into the night. The Pleiades star cluster was by now barely visible in the evening sky, and the eunoto sacrifice, which formed the next climax, could not be performed until the cluster had reappeared in the early morning in two months time. The sheer size of the gathering in these hard times could not be sustained for more than a day. Next morning, there was a general exodus by both elders and moran, seeking food elsewhere. Some moran made their way back to their forest camps. The parting gift for elders was one mug of tea to be shared among every four men, and it was accepted that there was no point in remonstrating for more. There was no more. Those that remained in the vicinity were primarily the manyata moran and their mothers.\",\n",

After the Muslim naming ceremony on the seventh day, the mother returns to her parents‚Äô home with her baby, and remains there for a period of six months or longer, during which she performs the prescribed post-natal ablutions daily for five months. This custom, known as bangwalle, has many different variations, but its performance for the first birth is normative. On completion of bangwalle the mother returns to her husband‚Äôs compound loaded with gifts from her kin, and for the first time in her husband‚Äôs home will suckle her infant without any pressure or compulsion being necessary. But throughout their lives, a parent of either sex and the first-born child observe a rigorous avoidance-relation, which is hardly relaxed even in private and when the child is fully grown. As the very full acount in the text illustrates (pp. 1 sqq.), social sanctions compel conformity to this behaviour, both during the period of ablutions and thereafter. The entire complex is best understood as a rite de passage, marking the transition in status to parenthood and full social maturity, and the lifelong avoidance-relation, which is extended by Fulani to the second and third child, and by Hausa-speaking Habe and Fulani to the next-born in greater or less degree, if the first child dies in infancy, gives a permanent expression to this new status. Similarly the post-natal ablutions, which are carried out for successive births, are probably best understood as extensions of ritual activity on the first childbirth rather than as measures of preventive hygiene (which the Hausa declare them to be), since such ablutions are not performed for stillbirths or miscarriages, and may be brought to an early conclusion if the mother is unable to bear the washing with nearly boiling water; if this happens, alternative ‚Äòmedicines‚Äô, herbal and Islamic, are employed.',\n",

       "  'passage': \"The spirits are usually classified as white or good, and black or evil. In the main, the black spirits are held to be pagan and live in the bush, while the white spirits are thought of as Moslem and live in the city. At times, however, other criteria are brought into play as when Massak'i, ‚Äúthe weaver,‚Äù is declared to be a white spirit because he weaves white cloth; or Ba'awzini, ‚Äúthe Touareg,‚Äù is called white because the Touareg are a light-skinned people. It is also said that a spirit may be white for the man who worships him, while he is black for everyone else. Classification, however, is not a major consideration, and there consequently is some doubt regarding the category to which many of the spirits should be assigned. 5 The division of spirits into white and Moslem on the one hand, and black and pagan on the other, is of Mohammedan origin. The present confusion in the classification of the spirits is thus largely due to the fact that these categories have been superimposed on a native division of the spirits into those of town and bush. It is maintained that only the black spirits cause illness while the white are harmless, but closer investigation soon discloses that any spirits can be malevolent as well as good. In general, however, the most malignant diseases are held to be caused by black spirits.\",\n",

A ‚Äúdaughter of the bori‚Äù called Ku'ba had a son, Mak'eri, whose wife, Tinay, had left him. The spirit `Dan Musa, angered at this result to his ‚Äúmount,‚Äù afflicted Tinay's little daughter with stomach trouble. Tinay, therefore, came to Ku'ba and was told to buy the speckled cock requ√Øred by this spirit as a sacrifice. She neglected this advice, whereupon her daughter became more seriously ill with c'oc'a , 31 C'oca' means, literally, ‚Äúmilking‚Äù and is therefore a disease appropriate to 'Inna, a Fulani milkmaid. It seems to be a kind of paralysis. caused by `Inna, the mother of `Dan Musa. In giving this account, it was emphasized that Ku'ba herself had not sought to inflict any harm on the girl, but that the bori who were ‚Äúon her head‚Äù took this means of avenging the insult offered to their ‚Äúmount.‚Äù Thereupon, Ku'ba's daughter-in-law came to her again, and was told that a bori performance was necessary, and that she must have a white sheep for `Inna, a black cock for Gajimari, a speckled cock for Duna and a red and white cock for K'ak'ari. These animals were all supplied by Tinay's husband Mak'eri as he was anxious for his wife to return to him and for his child to recover.\",\n",

The Maguzawa say that all remedies have been revealed to men by the spirits, and this proposition is most clearly illuminated by considering bori possession. The illness which makes a devotee originally enter the cult is caused by a spirit. It is cured by an initiation which allows the spirit to possess the sick person at will, whereupon the ‚Äúchild of the bori ‚Äù can prescribe for all who suffer from the same disease.

Allusion has already been made to the Dahomean doctrine that the spirits, vod≈≥, sent disease into the world. 59 See p. 54 above. The manner in which a vod≈≥ punishes someone who has incurred his wrath is by inflicting him with disease. However, the number of cases in which specific deities cause specific diseases, as is the case among the Hausa, is small. The connection of a given spirit with a particular disease appears similarly limited among the Yoruba. Shakpanna, the analogue of Sagbata in Dahomey, here also causes smallpox, but this appears to be the only case. 60 Farrow, 1926, p. 56. Among the Jukun, the spirits cause epidemic diseases, deaths from sunstroke, epileptic fits and fevers, and a certain amount of specialization is exercised by the spirits who bring on various illnesses. Ophthalmia is caused by Ayo, rheumatism and arthritis by Agbadu, and abdominal trouble by Akura. 61 Meek, 1931, p. 310. The concept that specific spirits cause definite diseases is thus seen to be widely spread in non-Mohammedan cultures of West Africa.

In Hausa society women are customarily the wards of men-their fathers, brothers, guardians, or husbands-and any woman who would like to lead an ‚Äòindependent‚Äô life finds her choices, within that context, extremely limited. The woman in the case-study mentioned above was one who had had great difficulty adjusting to her role as a ward of any of her relatives, consanguineal or affinal. She had lived with her parents in a small rural community until her first marriage when she left to live with her husband in a near-by city. Her marriage turned out badly, eventually terminating in divorce, and she returned to her father‚Äôs farm. Anxious to live in the city, any city, but unwilling to accept any of her matrimonial prospects, she remained with her family, worried and unhappy. One morning she awoke and reported that the left side of her body, her hand and foot, felt numb. Her condition deteriorated even as her parents vainly sought aid first from a local malam and then from the near-by dispensary. Suspecting that her affliction was due to the work of iskoki since they themselves had been cult-adepts, her parents arranged to have her taken to a renowned cult doctor who had also been a family friend. The healer diagnosed her illness, arranged for a cure, and at the conclusion of her treatment was kind enough to allow her to live in his compound, under his care and supervision.',\n",

Illnesses believed to be curable by girka are extremely varied and range from impotence, infertility, insanity, and paralysis to rashes and boils. Each specific illness or set of symptoms is symbolically linked to the actions of a specific spirit. No less important to an understanding of girka but perhaps less directly stated in the actions of participants, the ritual identifies the recruitment of a new cult-adept. This is symbolized by the definition of a successful cure as one which results in the attainment of harmony or reconciliation between the sufferer and the iskoki diagnosed to have caused his illness. The continued obligation of the former sufferer to obey the commands of the spirits on his head is expressed in the description of him as a ‚Äòhorse of the gods‚Äô as well as in the denial that a cured person has been exorcized of the afflicting spirits.

Rituals of affliction are performed on a non-automatic basis and are prompted by the diagnosis of a spiritually caused illness. During such rituals the formerly ill administer to the currently ill, and so it is that religious status in the bori cult is achieved through affliction. Thus, as Turner observes, affliction has a double meaning: it is both a punishment for some kind of neglect or transgression-for bori spirits do not possess a victim without provocation-and it is evidence of a spirit‚Äôs selection of his victim as a cult member (1967: 10). But initiation also marks the transition from one social status to another, from outsider to insider, at least as far as cult membership is concerned. Most social transitions fall under the heading of life-crisis rituals (birth/naming, marriage, death) and are concerned with ascribed statuses, but the bori initiation is a ritual applied to an achieved status.',\n",

First, then, the baby must be prepared ritually. Morning and evening ritual washing will continue for forty days, three days after birth the tribal marks are incised and the uvula removed, and seven days after birth, when the child is given its name, a Malam intercedes with Allah and asks him to protect it, while the maternal and paternal lineages express their goodwill towards it. Beyond this the parents will usually provide a number of charms to be worn round the baby‚Äôs neck or loins, but the number and kind is not rigidly prescribed. Next, the baby must be prepared physically, that is, it must be given enough food to ensure its growth, it must be given appropriate treatment if it is ill, and it must be protected from physical harm. After the first few weeks it will also receive its first training leading to sphincter control by being held in the proper position for defaecation. There is no attempt at super-ego formation during this period, there is no aura of ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù either explicit or implied, and the emphasis is on the skill of the adult in so arranging things that only the desired results are obtained. A crying baby is a grave reflection on the mother, and the slightest whimper results in the baby being offered the breast, often in fact having the breast thrust upon it so that it is forcibly fed and promptly brings it all up again as soon as its mouth is free. So that, though in the main it is true that the baby gets what he wants by crying for it, he also receives badness from the mother even in conditions where the ideas of punishment and training are absent. It is very noticeable that there is very little ‚Äúpraise-petting‚Äù of the infant, and this is possibly a major factor in setting the low emotional tone in the society, so that the individual does not feel the need for emotional personal relationships.',\n",

Buyu is the name of the evil spirit who brings many diseases and causes miscarriage in women. When there is some unusual or obstinate disease, or when a woman has had miscarriage, the manangs declare that Buyu is the cause of the trouble, and must be killed. A large number of witch-doctors are called together, and the feat is performed in this way: The patient is taken out of the room, and laid on the common veranda, and covered with a net. In the room is placed an offering of food, and the manangs walk in procession up and down the whole length of the house, chanting their incantations, and inviting the evil spirit to come to his victim, and also to partake of the sumptuous repast that is prepared for him. This occupies some time, for the spirit may be far away, on a journey, or fishing, or hunting. All lights are extinguished, and in the darkness the manangs walk up and down the public hall of the Dyak house. At intervals one of them peeps in at the door to see if the spirit has arrived. In due time the demon comes, and then the manangs themselves enter the darkened room. Presently sounds of scuffling, of clashing of weapons, and of shouting are heard by the Dyaks outside. Soon after the door is thrown open, and the demon said to be dead. He was cheated into coming to torment his prey, and instead of a week and helpless victim he met the crafty and mighty manangs, who have done what ordinary mortals cannot do--attacked and killed him. As a proof of the reality of the deed lights are brought in, and the manangs point to spots of blood on the floor, and occasionally to the corpse itself in the shape of a dead monkey or snake, which they say was the form the spirit took for the occasion. The trick is a very simple one. Some time in the day the manangs procure blood from a fowl or some other animal, or it may be from their own bodies, mix it with water in a bamboo to prevent congealing, smuggle it into the room, and scatter it on the floor in the dark. This can safely be done, as no one but the manangs themselves are in the room. Neither lights nor outsiders are admitted, on the plea that under such circumstances the demon could not be enticed to enter. The trick has often been detected and the performers openly accused of imposture; consequently, it is not now practised so often as in former times.

Everyone has both a semengat and an ayu as an old manang , or shaman, put it: ‚ÄòOur semengat and ayu share the same breath‚Äô (‚ÄòSemengat enggau ayu kitai saum seput‚Äô) . But the ayu does not reside in the body. It takes the form of a kind of plant - it is usually likened to the bamboo (buloh) in appearance - and it is believed to grow on a far off mountain. On the slopes of this vast mountain grow the myriad ayu of all the Iban people, and there they are tended by an aged and beneficient supernatural being named Manang Betuah. The ayu of each bilek-family are conceived as of growing in a separate and compact clump, and when a child is born a new shoot appears at the base of the clump, just as it does with the bamboo plant itself. The health of the various members of the family - so it is believed - is controlled in a kind of magical symbiosis by the state of growth of their various ayu . If, for example, the ayu should become overgrown with creepers, the individual whose soul-substitute it is, will become ill; and shamans (manang) are frequently commissioned to visit the ayu of sick persons to free them from encumbrances, and generally to tend them. It is the soul of the shaman that carries out this task, while the shaman himself is in a state of trance. The purpose of the nusop ayu ritual, which often accompanies adoption, is the cutting away of the child's ayu from the ayu clump of his natal group, and the replanting of it with the ayu clump of his adoptive bilek-family .‚Äù\",\n",

       "  'passage': \"In contrast to Lewis's cross-cultural study, Freeman's own work deals with Iban shamanism in its socio-cultural context. Unlike Sutlive's view of the physician who heals himself, Freeman describes the manang as a ‚Äòhealer of the spiritually afflicted‚Äô and sees the practice of shamanism as oriented to the needs of the clients (1975:283). He notes the Iban belief that all humans have separable souls ( semengat ), which may wander abroad and become ensnared by a malevolent spirit. Should this happen ‚Äòthe owner will become ill and it is with the recovery of souls and the returning of them to their rightful owners that Iban shamans ( manang ) are principally concerned‚Äô (Freeman 1979:235). In the article ‚ÄòShaman and incubus‚Äô, Freeman briefly describes the diagnosis and ritual typically performed by a manang in order to discern the state and whereabouts of the missing soul and to effect its return (1967:316). He then recounts and analyses an instance of a quite different manang performance, in which the shaman slays an incubus spirit. This spirit ( antu buyu ) is thought to seduce Iban women and later to claim the soul of the women's offspring, resulting in miscarriage or the death of a child (1967:317-318). Freeman describes Manang Bungai, the shaman concerned in this instance, as ‚Äòa strongly masculine figure‚Äô in both bearing and personality (1967:320). From the time of his arrival in the longhouse to perform the ritual, he was ‚Äòthe imperturbable master of the scene‚Äô (1967:325). Manang Bungai specialized in the slaying of incubi, a formidable task which few shaman were prepared to tackle (1967:319-320). This suggests that the manang role may be interpreted by individual shaman in terms of their own personality and disposition. So Nyala, an aggressively masculine longhouse-headman and renowned head-hunter, confided to Freeman that, if in a dream he were ordered to become a shaman, he would, like Bungai, specialize in the slaying of incubi. ‚ÄòBut then‚Äô, observes Freeman, referring to head-hunting and shamanism, ‚Äòthe two pastimes have much in common‚Äô (1967:340).\",\n",
